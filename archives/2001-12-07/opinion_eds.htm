      <p align="left">The seniors on this campus probably do not recall a holiday 
        season that was less holiday-oriented than this one. Yes, some of the 
        houses have put up decorations here and there (except for Quinby House, 
        which has put up decorations everywhere), and occasionally you will see 
        some lights twinkling from some lonely dorm room, but all-in-all, there 
        is little to distinguish this campus from the month of September. Not 
        even the weather.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The days of the grand holiday parties with formal dress, 
        cocktails, and tree decorating seem to be a thing of the past-as are other 
        leisurely social events throughout the year. And the reason for this seems 
        at least in part to be that nobody has time to partake in such indulgences.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Why do students today seem to find themselves so much busier? 
        Is it because there's just much more work to do than there used to be? 
        In a sense, yes. But the work is not forced on students. Students take 
        it on themselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Students on this campus seem to be involved in so many different 
        activities that they have no time for anything else, often including eating 
        dinner. Anything that doesn't make it on their to-do list is usually neglected, 
        unless they can squeeze it in between Meetings A and B. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Certainly students enjoy these activities, but for the most 
        part, the activities are about doing things for other people, not for 
        themselves. And if it is for themselves, it tends to be with some hope 
        that it will be a resume builder or a subtle educational experience to 
        draw on in some future career event. Few activities, in fact, are solely 
        for the self, or for the enjoyment of the present moment.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And certainly there is nothing wrong with doing things for 
        other people. Volunteering, for example, is undoubtedly an extremely worthy 
        and valuable occupation of one's time. But doing things for oneself, unambitiously, 
        is equally as important, and that is something that is often forgotten 
        on this campus.<br>
        We should be very careful that we don't spend so much time doing so many 
        activities, as worthwhile as they may be, that we have no time to relax 
        and enjoy things simply the way they are. The lack of holiday spirit seems 
        to be a sad symptom of just that, though, and it we may very well regret 
        it someday.</p>
