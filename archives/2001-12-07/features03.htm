        <font size="2">JESSIE SOLOMON-GREENBAUM</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">It has been nearly three months since September 11, yet 
        every time we turn on the television, check our e-mail, or open a newspaper, 
        we are bombarded by news of it. Despite the massive quantity of information 
        surrounding the events of September 11th and its aftermath, all the news 
        has begun to blend together. How many times have you seen the video of 
        the plane hitting the World Trade Center, the photos of Ground Zero, or 
        the images of American troops departing for Afghanistan?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to fully understand the effect of the terrorist 
        attacks on America, we must seek to hear all perspectives, not just the 
        views that have been duplicated over and over again on the news. To find 
        a unique perspective, I talked to students from the Kennedy Park Tutoring 
        Center in the Portland Housing Authority, where I volunteer weekly, about 
        the issues surrounding the 11th that effect them daily.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Every night of the week a group of Bowdoin students travels 
        to the tutoring center to help the students who live in the Portland Housing 
        Authority with their homework. The center at first looks just like another 
        branch of the surrounding residential apartments, but as you enter the 
        ground floor doorway and make your way up the stairs, you realize that 
        this is a place for students. With murals and posters scattered on the 
        walls, while the kids gather around tables to do their homework, talking 
        and laughing about what happened that day in school, the atmosphere of 
        the tutoring center is much like the students who frequent it: vibrant, 
        yet, laid-back and alive.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The majority of students that come to the tutoring center 
        are refugees from war-torn countries, such as Somalia and Ethiopia, which 
        often have pasts shaped by warfare, economic tumult, famine, and many 
        deaths. When working at the tutoring center we often help students who 
        are trying to write a personal essay describing where they come from. 
        In a calm voice, the students try to articulate the war, losing their 
        father, their friends, neighbors and homes, fleeing to Kenya and seeking 
        shelter in the United States.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Regardless of whether they are from Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, 
        and, occasionally, Cambodia, these students have had traumatic childhoods. 
        These students offer a unique perspective on issues surrounding the attacks 
        of September 11, not only because of their background, but also because 
        of the fact that many of them are Muslim. </p>
      <p align="left">When I broached the subject with the students, I found that 
        at first they were a bit reluctant to talk, but once they started talking, 
        they just kept going. I ended up having extensive discussions with three 
        students: Nadar Mohamud, Hamdi M. Ali, and Abdi. All the students were 
        Muslim and felt that because of their religion September 11 had greatly 
        changed their lives in America. The students reported that their Muslim 
        friends, neighbors, and family members had been taunted and sometimes 
        even assaulted in Portland. Nadar, a quiet, intelligent 10th grade girl 
        who smiles often, tells me: &quot;At school, some kid came up to this 
        boy from Afghanistan and asked him if his Osana Bin Laden was his uncle. 
        The kid replied sarcastically 'Yeah, he's my uncle.' He got suspended 
        from school for two weeks. People got mad at the principal and he said 
        that it was for his own safety. Maybe that's true, but nothing happened 
        to the kid who asked him.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nadar also tells me that an old man had been assaulted exiting 
        Portland's only mosque. Hamdi, a tall, thin 8th grade girl who seems old 
        for her age and is eager to talk, tells me &quot;I cover sometimes (referring 
        to the Islamic tradition of women covering their heads), sometimes not. 
        One day my teacher asked me if I wasn't covering 'cause I was scared&#133;. 
        Right after the attacks my sister, who covers, was walking and a fireman 
        started yelling at her.&quot; Abdi, a young man who is a freshman in college, 
        talks very seriously about the issue, and says that for him, everything 
        is different now than it was before September 11: &quot;My whole life 
        is changed because I am Muslim. My family and friends, especially the 
        women, are scared to go out. They're afraid they'll get threatened, arrested, 
        even beat up.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The students conveyed serious messages that they felt America 
        needs to hear in order to understand the Muslim community's relationship 
        to September 11. &quot;People just start pointing, even if they're not 
        100 percent sure,&quot; Nadar says. &quot;I just hope people can understand 
        from us that it is not all Muslim people's fault.&quot; Abdi echoed Nadar's 
        sentiments: &quot;We felt that what happened [the attack against America] 
        was wrong. This is a political thing, not a religious thing. First of 
        all I'm African, not Middle-Eastern. A lot of my friends who aren't even 
        Muslim, who are just colored, are being targeted.&quot; Hamdi pointed 
        to the actual precepts of Islamic religion: &quot;Islam doesn't say anywhere 
        that killing is right.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both Abdi and Nadar expressed doubts about the integrity 
        of the media's coverage of September 11th and the war in Afghanistan. 
        &quot;I don't believe anything I hear on the news,&quot; Nadar says. &quot;I 
        want to see it with my own eyes.&quot; Abdi agreed: &quot;You're gonna 
        hear in the news what the government wants us to hear. They're hiding 
        how many people are dying, just like they did in Vietnam.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While all three students disagreed strongly with the attacks 
        on the United States, they had mixed feelings about the government's retaliatory 
        actions. Abdi talks about the terrorist attacks as a result of past United 
        States actions: &quot;If you respect people, you get it back. If the United 
        States had given respect, they would have gotten it back.&quot; Of the 
        U.S. military's retaliation he says, &quot;I think they did the wrong 
        thing but I can't say 100 percent. They've killed a lot of innocent people&#133;. 
        Instead of fighting the whole country they should make efforts to talk 
        about it. George W. Bush knows his family is never gonna fight.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hamdi tells me: &quot;I think what happened was wrong, but 
        I don't think doing it all over is right&#133;. Killing innocent people 
        is not right. I'm not saying they should do nothing, just something different.&quot; 
        Nadar pointed out the contradictory message American students are receiving: 
        &quot;In school they say never react to violence with violence. But that 
        is what they're doing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One thing is clear in these student's eyes: the attacks 
        of September 11th and the events following have changed their perspectives 
        forever. Most of these students originally came to America as a refuge 
        from the war torn countries that were their homes. Now, the United States 
        does not seem quite as protected anymore. &quot;It shows that any country 
        can be attacked,&quot; Hamdi says at the end of our discussion. &quot;Its 
        reality, you know. No country is completely safe.&quot;<br>
        She adds with a smile: &quot;I've learned that airplanes are really not 
        that safe!&quot;<br>
