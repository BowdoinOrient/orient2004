        <font size="2">JAMES FISHER<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>
      <p align="left">Preempting student temptations to plagiarize or cheat on 
        exams during the final weeks of the semester, the Judicial Board reminded 
        the student body last week that repercussions for academic dishonesty 
        are consistently severe. Tara Talbot '02, Judicial Board Chair, wrote 
        in an all-students email last week that &quot; 'Panic' and 'ignorance' 
        rarely, if ever, constitute mitigating circumstances in cases of academic 
        dishonesty.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The message came two weeks before the beginning of final 
        exams, &quot;the time when,&quot; Talbot wrote, &quot;academic pressures 
        most tempt students to resort to&#133;plagiarism, faulty citation, dual 
        submission and other forms of cheating.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Judicial Board heard just over a dozen cases of suspected 
        academic dishonesty in each of the last two academic years. Board member 
        Laura Hilburn '02 said that many of those cases involved students' misuse 
        of the Internet as a research tool.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Internet was &quot;involved in almost all of the cases&quot; 
        last year, J-Board chair Tara Talbot '02 said. In the 2000-2001 academic 
        year, the J-Board entertained eight plagiarism cases.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For some institutions of higher learning, the year has been 
        clouded by debates over the juncture of academic dishonesty and technological 
        tools. Faculty members are concerned that students find copying and pasting 
        quotations, arguments, or whole papers so easy that the temptation not 
        to cite or avoid such use is overwhelmingly strong.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Their fears have, in some cases, been grounded. At the University 
        of Virginia, Louis Bloomfield, a physics professor, wrote a computer program 
        to scan the 1800 papers he received in five semesters of teaching an introductory 
        'physics for poets' class. The program looked for duplications of strings 
        of six words or more- indications that students had somehow copied other 
        students' papers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bloomfield found well over a hundred papers in which 500 
        words or more repeated. He referred the cases to the University's Honor 
        Committee, which expelled most of the students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Office of Student Affairs has considered subscribing 
        to an online service, <a href="http://www.turnitin.com">Turnitin.com</a>, 
        which offers to scan the Internet for text matching that in papers submitted 
        by professors. But that decision has not yet been made, and administrators 
        sounded skeptical that it will be, citing cost concerns as well as the 
        danger that students might feel their professors mistrust them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The University of Virginia's experience has reverberated 
        on campuses across the nation. Haverford, a Quaker school in Pennsylvania 
        famous for its honor code, published an article in its fall magazine on 
        the subject. The author, Robert Boynton, a journalism professor at New 
        York University, complained of the &quot;Napsterization of knowledge- 
        the notion that ideas&#133; are little more than disembodied entities&#133; 
        available to be appropriated electronically in any way users wish.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From the Judicial Board's perspective, the Internet cuts 
        both ways. Students and faculty alike realize that the simple act of plagiarism 
        is now a few mouse clicks away. But some J-Board members noted that professors 
        are finding out about Internet plagiarism just as easily as students are 
        committing it. &quot;Professors might type the first sentence of a paper 
        into a search engine,&quot; said Hilburn.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Peter Schilling, director of Bowdoin's Educational Technology 
        Center, said that the Internet can be a valuable research tool for students 
        looking for a broad level of information on a topic. Talbot agreed. &quot;Most 
        students, including me, find themselves doing more research on the Internet,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Schilling noted that Internet searches often turn up 
        vast amounts of potentially relevant material, and &quot;there's more 
        effort needed to winnow through it that students don't always make.&quot;</p>
