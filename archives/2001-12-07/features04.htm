        CONTRIBUTING WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;My heart aches when I think of the horrors that are 
        coming,&quot; William Pitt Fessenden wrote of the Civil War, now a reality 
        in 1861, &quot;but I am consoled with the belief that much good will come 
        out of it all. With my consent, there shall be no peace until all these 
        disturbing questions are definitely and properly settled. This contest 
        finds me prepared-I know it must terminate in good for the country-republicanism 
        can stand only when based on honest principles and should fall when perverted 
        from its true purpose, as ours has long been.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From his seat as Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, 
        Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1823, was in a position of considerable power 
        and headache. Before him and his committee lay a daunting task. Funding 
        the northern Civil War effort would not be easy, especially since the 
        state of the nation's treasury was in poor shape. In fact, the Treasury 
        was bankrupt. Half of the country had just been severed below the line 
        of the Potomac River. Tariffs that came through Southern seaports were 
        already being denied to the Treasury. Also, without a national bank, currency, 
        or tax plan, the finances of the Union were in poor shape for war.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Elsewhere in the North, however, finances weren't too much 
        of a problem. Thomas Worchester Hyde, Bowdoin class of 1861, arrived in 
        Augusta to take command of Company D, of the 7th Maine Volunteers. Hyde 
        remembered that he was welcome with &quot;all the honors and a supper 
        that no one can appreciate who has not eaten beans baked in a hole in 
        the ground.&quot; The son of a wealthy merchant, Hyde found that the men's 
        living conditions-camped in Sibley tents beside the Maine State House 
        and near the river-were quite hard when it began to rain. Hyde quickly 
        took the initiative and also his wallet to the nearest hotel and placed 
        the 80 men of his company in comfortable rooms! As for himself, however, 
        Hyde went back to the campsite, inviting his lieutenants to join him so 
        that they might learn what life as a campaigning soldier was like. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back in Washington, D.C., Fessenden was hard at work. The 
        Senate Finance Committee backed plans for both a new income tax and an 
        increase in tariffs. Opposition to the tariff came from Massachusetts 
        Senator Charles Sumner, who feared that the bill would offend foreign 
        nations. Fessenden snapped back, saying that the good of the country was 
        more important than the profits of foreigners and pointed out that these 
        new tariffs were essential for financing the War. &quot;I am willing to 
        risk the righteous indignation of those people abroad who think they will 
        not make as much money out of us as they ought to,&quot; the Maine senator 
        thundered.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The income tax bill, which taxed three percent of a person's 
        income-should it be more than $800-was easier in passing. Also, to the 
        measure of confiscating Confederate property, the senator was in full 
        support. For Fessenden, the remainder of 1861 was spent watching developments 
        and preparing for any other disasters that could come along. The Union 
        defeat at Bull Run caused a panic in the capitol that the senator did 
        not feel obliged to partake in. He was also unable to return to Bowdoin 
        to attend his youngest son, Sam's graduation.<br>
        Young Sam, always adventurous, was looking for even more trouble now that 
        he had graduated from college. Before entering Bowdoin, he had run away 
        to help fight for freedom in &quot;bleeding Kansas.&quot; Now, the young 
        Fessenden was joining his two older brothers in the service of the Union 
        Army.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sam Fessenden's friend from Bowdoin, Thomas Hyde, in the 
        meantime was elected major in the 7th Maine Volunteers. A true test of 
        Hyde's ability (he was only twenty at this point) came when he was ordered 
        to take the entire regiment (a regiment is usually led by a colonel, but 
        the Seventh's colonel had not yet arrived to take charge and neither had 
        his second in command) down to Washington, D.C. Hyde was probably the 
        most knowledgeable man in the regiment thanks to his previous experience 
        in an Illinois regiment before returning to Maine.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The newly elected major was thus in the lead of one thousand 
        Maine volunteers as they marched down to the train station and across 
        the mountains to war. Hyde remembered that train ride down to Boston: 
        &quot;Handkerchiefs waved from every farmhouse, cheers arose at every 
        station, while out band played and the colors were flaunted from the car 
        platforms, and so we jolted on the most of the day, the excitement not 
        abating when in a column, nearly a thousand strong, we filed into Faneuil 
        Hall to take a lunch provided by the city of Boston.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On its way to the front Hyde's regiment was reassigned to 
        Baltimore, Maryland. Preparing to receive the riot that had welcomed the 
        6th Massachusetts when they marched through this city, the 7th Mainers 
        were shocked to learn that they had been given no ammunition along with 
        their muskets. Hyde's orders were thus for the use of the bayonet should 
        any trouble arise. Luckily no trouble came from the rebel sympathizing 
        elements of the populace. The next morning, however, Hyde noted that a 
        riot broke out when the men were unhappy with the quality of bread they 
        were given!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fearing that the Army of the Potomac would leave the Seventh 
        Maine behind to guard the northern city, Hyde went to the headquarters 
        of Maine General Oliver Otis Howard, Bowdoin class of 1850, and asked 
        to be on his staff should a forward movement still find Hyde in Baltimore. 
        This move may have been unnecessary for Hyde's troopers were reassigned 
        to the field army and found themselves camping in Virginia. Once again 
        judging the campsite inadequate, Hyde found room at the luxurious Willard's 
        Hotel in Washington, D.C. The 7th Maine was placed in the Third Brigade 
        of the Second Division of the Sixth Army Corps.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Hyde, like the entire nation, found that nothing really 
        resembling action was being done. Union commander George Brinton McClellan 
        was preparing for a massive invasion but seemed to have no guts to begin 
        an advance. (Of McClellan, Fessenden wrote that he had no faith in him 
        and also that the general was &quot;utterly unfit for his position.&quot;) 
        In March of 1862, however, &quot;Little Mac&quot; moved and the War in 
        the east began.<br>

      <p align="left">Author's Note: Well, I never expected this series to last 
        so long! My plans were to wrap up the stories of Hyde and Fessenden in 
        one semester, but alas it is not meant to be. We shall thus continue with 
        the series in the Spring, and I also hope to launch the World War II project 
        sometime in March as well. Things of course may change, but at least I'll 
        be back on campus and you can all pelt me with snowballs should the progress 
        of my series this year be to your distaste. In any case, thanks for reading, 
        and Happy Holidays!<br>
