      <p align="left">As the semester draws to a close and the holiday season 
        embraces the days ahead, student-run as well as community-organized opportunities 
        offer students and faculty an array of opportunities to spread the season's 
        spirit of giving.<br>
        The Adopt a Family project, organized annually by the Salvation Army in 
        December, encourages members of the community to &quot;adopt&quot; a low-income 
        family in need of assistance. The adopting members of the community provide 
        their family with gifts, warm clothing, and a holiday dinner to brighten 
        the holiday seasons of many local families. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin groups currently collecting donations for their 
        adopted families are Ladd House, Boody House, Smith House, Burnett House, 
        Baxter House, Quinby House, Mayflower Apartments 9 and 10, Women's Rugby, 
        the Bowdoin Outing Club, cross-country and track, the Korean American 
        Students' Association, and Economics 211: Poverty, Inequality, and Redistribution, 
        taught by Prof. John Fitzgerald. Students who are not members of an Adopt 
        a Family group are urged to support these groups by providing small donations 
        for their adopted families.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This Sunday night at 5:45 p.m. all interested Bowdoin community 
        members are invited to take part in the annual Caroling in the Community 
        service event. The Community Service Resource Center sponsors this evening 
        of caroling in the Brunswick community. This year groups of about ten 
        carolers will visit numerous nursing homes in and around Brunswick. All 
        interested students, faculty, staff, and community members should meet 
        this Sunday night, December 9, in the Atrium of Druckenmiller Hall to 
        warm up their voices with hot chocolate and cookies. Caroling will take 
        place from 5:45 p.m. to 7 p.m. More holiday cheer will follow with a night 
        of music provided by Bowdoin's acapella groups at their annual holiday 
        concert. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Helmreich House reminds the Bowdoin community to &quot;not 
        be Grinches&quot; by sponsoring their third annual Giving Tree to benefit 
        the Tedford Shelter of Brunswick. The Tedford Shelter offers temporary 
        emergency housing for individuals ages 18 and older. A Giving Tree fully 
        decorated with ornaments, suggesting gift ideas, is up in both Helmreich 
        House and Smith Union. Students are encouraged to take at least one ornament 
        and buy a gift for a resident of the Tedford Shelter. The most requested 
        gifts this year are calling cards, clothing, toys, games, and any other 
        practical items. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Gifts may be placed wrapped or unwrapped (Helmreich House 
        members are willing to wrap any gifts that are received unwrapped) until 
        December 15, when they will be collected and sent to the shelter. Any 
        questions should be directed to contacts Lauren Sarno (<a href="mailto:lsarno@bowdoin.edu">lsarno@bowdoin.edu</a>) 
        or Allison Lavoie (<a href="mailto:alavoie@bowdoin.edu">alavoie@bowdoin.edu</a>) 
        of Helmreich.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This coming Tuesday, December 11, a group of students will 
        be visiting nearby Coffin Elementary School to assist the children in 
        making holiday gifts for their families. Students who are interested in 
        arts and crafts and enjoy children should contact Lydia Bell (<a href="mailto:lbell2@bowdoin.edu">lbell2@bowdoin.edu</a>), 
        the Coordinator of Student Community Service Programs, to take part in 
        this joyous volunteer opportunity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lydia Bell reminds students that volunteering should not 
        end after students leave campus to return home for the break. &quot;There 
        are volunteer opportunities in every town, more so around the holidays,&quot; 
        Bell explains. One of the best ways to start the search for community 
        service opportunities is through local chapters of the United Way. Information 
        on local United Way organizations can be found on their website, <a href="http://national.unitedway.org">http://national.unitedway.org</a>. 
        Students should also contact local schools, libraries, shelters, and soup 
        kitchens to aid those in need in students' own communities. The holiday 
        season is a season of giving and what better way to celebrate the spirit 
        of the season than by serving those who are less fortunate at this time 
        of thankfulness.<br>
