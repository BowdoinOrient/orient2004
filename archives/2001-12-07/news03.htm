      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bowdoin to admit fewer rated athletes</font><br>
        <font size="2">NICHOLAS J. LoVECCHIO<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>
      <p align="left">Faculty members discussed the role of athletics at their 
        meeting Monday, responding to growing concerns over athletics at Bowdoin 
        and prompted by the recent Mellon report on NESCAC athletics. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The biggest news came when Dean of Admissions Jim Miller 
        announced that the College will enroll roughly 20 percent fewer rated 
        athletes in the next class. Admissions will aim for the Class of 2006 
        to have 79 rated athletes matriculating, as compared to the 99 rated athletes 
        that matriculated in the Class of 2005 (124 rated athletes were admitted 
        in that class).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rated athletes are those that coaches have marked as desirable 
        for admission. They are not considered to be recruited, according to Director 
        of Athletics Jeff Ward, because many of those athletes first approached 
        Bowdoin coaches.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">President Barry Mills, who led the move in cooperation with 
        Miller and Ward, called it &quot;appropriate&quot; but &quot;risky,&quot; 
        as it could potentially put Bowdoin athletics at a competitive disadvantage, 
        since he did not act in concert with administrators at other NESCAC schools. 
        Whether other NESCAC schools have made similar decisions on their own 
        remains to be seen.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Bowdoin has already acted on its own in this initiative, 
        Ward urged that for future changes &quot;no institution can act individually.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This sentiment, shared by many members of the athletic staff, 
        drew criticism from history professor Dan Levine. &quot;I hope it's not 
        true that we can only do what the NESCAC is going to do. I hope we can 
        make some decision on our own,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Still, the initiative was acknowledged to be &quot;good 
        news&quot; by members of the faculty, but only as a first step. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Noting that Bowdoin is smaller than many other NESCAC schools 
        but fields as many or more teams as other larger schools, professors expressed 
        concern for what they see as both financial and intellectual costs of 
        supporting such an extensive program.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Several faculty members argued that too many athletes prioritize 
        athletics over academics, and the results are noticeable in the classroom. 
        Students' commitments to athletics, they said, cause great infringements 
        on class attendance and coursework. In the words of one professor, many 
        athletes have &quot;wacko priorities.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There was wide agreement, though, that different teams foster 
        different commitment levels in students. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professors said that students often miss classes weekly 
        (especially on Friday) so they can go to their athletic events. Not only 
        that, they said, but many athletes frequently tell professors that they 
        cannot complete their work on time because of a sports event. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There's nothing I can say to that,&quot; music professor 
        Jim McCalla said.<br>
        Another related problem concerned class selection. According to one professor, 
        students make their course selections based on what time they have sporting 
        events, and some have admitted that their coaches subtly discouraged certain 
        class time slots.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ward assured faculty that coaches and members of the athletic 
        department routinely tell athletes that they never have to miss class 
        for practice or competition, and he said that his goal for next year is 
        to have students miss no more than one class for an away competition.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, that didn't provide comfort to professors who feel 
        that nonetheless students do not understand that they do not have to miss 
        class. &quot;They're not getting it,&quot; one professor said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">English professor Marilyn Reizbaum said it should not be 
        acceptable for students to have to miss even one class because of sporting 
        events.<br>
        Levine recommended that the faculty pass a measure stating that no athlete 
        can be disciplined for missing an athletic event because of an academic 
        commitment.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In what Mills later called the most important comment made, 
        education professor Nancy Jennings warned against putting too much value 
        in the quantitative indicators that the NESCAC report used to evaluate 
        students. Academic engagement, and not just evaluation, should be important, 
        she said.<br>
        As Bowdoin is &quot;publicly on record&quot; devaluing numerical indicators 
        such as SATs and GPAs, Jennings suggested that Bowdoin &quot;figure out 
        a way to be smarter about what we use as indicators.&quot; Both qualitative 
        and quantitative research is necessary, she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some also said that too much preference is given to athletics 
        over other activities. Philosophy professor Scott Sehon questioned why 
        other organizations, such as the Outing Club and the Bowdoin Christian 
        Fellowship, were not given similar preference in the admissions process. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Noting that &quot;we are not starting from scratch&quot; 
        and therefore cannot implement equitable &quot;fast-track&quot; admissions 
        processes for all organizations, Sehon recommended that athletes' credentials 
        at least be on par with those of non-athletes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Stefanie Pemper, coach of women's basketball, 
        the importance of athletics lies in teamwork, competition, and striving 
        toward a goal. &quot;I don't think you can compare that to the Bowdoin 
        Christian Fellowship. I don't think you can compare that to the Outing 
        Club. I think it's different, and I think it's more important to those 
        students.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Music professor Mary Hunter briefly responded that education 
        doesn't have to be about competition. &quot;What's the difference between 
        playing and competing,&quot; she asked.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A larger question that emerged was rooted in anthropology 
        professor Scott MacEachern's half-joking remark that &quot;Our students 
        sometimes seem to be so well-rounded that I can't get a grip on them.&quot; 
        The concept of the well-rounded Bowdoin student was brought up several 
        times, not always in the favor that the admissions office looks might 
        look at it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We make the optimistic assumption that the degree 
        of engagement that our students have is infinite. I'm not totally sure 
        that that's the case,&quot; MacEachern said. In other words, students 
        are not likely to be equally committed to both sports and academics (and 
        other activities)-one of them has to give, and, many professors believe, 
        that happens to be academics.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Instead of talking about athletics in general,&quot; 
        MacEachern said, &quot;perhaps we should be talking about particular kinds 
        of commitments that students have.&quot;<br>
        Reizbaum suggested: &quot;We should reconsider the well-roundedness of 
        students. Should that be our top priority?&quot; The wider implications 
        of such a question, she said, would include the possibility of marginalizing 
        or diminishing sports.<br>
        In response to the tone of the meeting, which largely favored adopting 
        stricter academic standards that would reposition students' priorities, 
        philosophy professor Denis Corish strongly urged that the faculty not 
        impose overly professional career standards on students-athletes and non-athletes 
        alike. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;What we claim to do is give people liberal educations, 
        and all components, outside as well as inside, are important,&quot; Corish 
        said.<br>
