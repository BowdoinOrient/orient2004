        </font></p>
      <p align="left">To whom it may concern:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I am writing to express my concern over the disrespect many 
        students show towards the hosts of parties at Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last weekend, Baxter hosted a theme party which you may 
        have attended; it was called EuroJam. It is the only party of the year 
        in which we try to enforce a dress code and, in addition to advertising, 
        I personally sent out 4 emails to the entire campus in an attempt to clarify 
        this dress code. The party was not attempting to be &quot;elitist&quot; 
        or &quot;discriminating&quot; in any way. It was an attempt to create 
        an atmosphere different from other campus wides, and to do so, we gave 
        very simple guidelines for a dress code: no jeans, no sneakers, no hats, 
        no ripped clothing. This is a dress code similar to many dance clubs and 
        bars in cities, and the party was no more discriminating than if we had 
        a &quot;seniors only&quot; party, or a semi-formal Valentines Day party. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, as I worked the door on the night of the party, 
        I was appalled at the attitude of many people. As many of you were pushing 
        me aside, calling me names inappropriate for this newspaper, and declaring, 
        &quot;let me in or I'll get you in trouble&quot;, I felt as if I had regressed 
        to grade school. I thought we had moved beyond threats and coercion through 
        tattle tailing. Thus, after about two hours of enforcing the dress code, 
        it eventually became so frustrating and impossible to deal with people 
        that we just let everyone in. More than anything, I was disappointed in 
        those of you who would not allow, even for one night, a college house 
        party where everyone respected and got excited about the theme.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The more important issue at hand is simple respect for the 
        house residents and for each other as students. There is no &quot;rule&quot; 
        that says we have to let everyone in. We make the greatest effort to be 
        open to everyone, but please understand it is very difficult. We are personally 
        liable at every party, and we must take this into consideration when letting 
        people through our door. If you show up on our doorstep under the influence, 
        out of theme, without an ID, causing disorder, and demanding to be let 
        in, it is very frustrating for those of us trying to maintain a safe and 
        enjoyable party. And if I happen to be the one working the door in this 
        case, I guarantee you will not get in. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So do not come over and expect alcohol to be served to you, 
        as this is not your right as a Bowdoin student. Do not come over, be disrespectful, 
        and then claim, &quot;You have to let me in,&quot; because quite simply, 
        you are wrong. No one is forcing you to agree with our events or attend 
        our parties. However, if you would like to attend, and wish to enjoy yourself 
        in a social atmosphere, then you are more than welcome. But if you do 
        not, or if you wish to disrespect those who put great effort into Bowdoin 
        social life, please stay home and save us the trouble. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
      </p>

      <p><font size="4">Librarians say: &quot;Shh!&quot; and &quot;No food!&quot;</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>To the Bowdoin Community: </p>
      <p>We are writing to inform the Bowdoin Community about the new Food and 
        Drink Policy that will be implemented in the Library next semester. The 
        H&amp;L Library always has had small signs posted at the entrance asking 
        you not to bring food and drinks into the building.However, over the last 
        couple of years, we frequently have turned a blind eye to people walking 
        in with beverages, etc., since the building was in disarray during construction. 
      </p>
      <p>Now that renovations are complete, we ask your assistance in implementing 
        a stricter prohibition on food and on beverage containers that can spill. 
        Beginning next semester, we will ask you not to bring any food into the 
        library. For beverages, only spillproof plastic containers, such as Bowdoin 
        Dining Hall mugs, will be permitted; cardboard coffee cups, soda cans, 
        and other containers that can spill easily will be prohibited. This policy, 
        which will be implemented in the branch libraries as well as at Hawthorne-Longfellow, 
        will ensure that buildings and collections stay clean and insect-free, 
        and will underscore college-wide efforts to reduce the consumption of 
        throwaway paper products.</p>
      <p>All libraries try to protect valuable collections by keeping food and 
        drinks away from books. Food residue and spills are devastating to books 
        and also damaging to furniture, carpets, and computers. Spills and crumbs 
        also attract insects and mold, which cause further destruction to paper, 
        leather and fabrics. </p>
      <p>This semester library staff met to discuss the Library's proposed Food 
        and Drink Policy with Student Government, who offered their support. The 
        Office for a Sustainable Bowdoin and Bowdoin Dining Services are enthusiastic 
        about the new policy, which coordinates with their promotions of reusable 
        beverage containers to reduce consumption of paper products.</p>
      <p>All Bowdoin students receive a free Bowdoin plastic mug during their 
        first year. The H-L Library will keep a supply of these mugs at the Circulation 
        desk to sell to any one who may wish to transfer a beverage from a paper 
        or styrofoam container to bring in to the building.</p>
      <p>The Library belongs to each of you. We hope you appreciate our goal of 
        protecting collections and facilities, and maintaining a clean, pleasant 
        environment for study.</p>
