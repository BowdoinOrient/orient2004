        Not only do the British Isles produce the best rock groups, sometimes 
        the best American bands have to turn to England to get recognition. Jimi 
        Hendrix didn't hit the big time until he moved to England and hooked up 
        with The Experience to form rock's best trio. Nirvana had far more success 
        with their first album Bleach in England than in America. <br>

          <td><font size="2">The Strokes have been making waves since they arrived

      </table>
      <p align="left">The British music press think the members of New York City's 
        The Strokes are some kinds of gods who will save rock and roll. The band's 
        debut record,<i> Is This It?</i>, has been available to the English for 
        months and just won the NME Album of the Year award. The album was released 
        in America only a few weeks ago, with a different cover and the British 
        hit &quot;New York City Cops&quot; was replaced with a new song in the 
        wake of the terrorist attacks. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of Brit rock's most prominent figures, Noel Gallagher 
        of Oasis, declared Seattle's Black Rebel Motorcycle Club a.k.a. B.R.M.C. 
        his new favorite band about a year ago, and consequently, they've also 
        been featured in the headlines of the NME more often than Rolling Stone. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both of these bands' videos display their retro style and 
        sound. &quot;Last Nite,&quot; by the Strokes, looks like a classic TV 
        guest performance, while B.R.M.C.'s &quot;Whatever Happened to My Rock 
        'n' Roll (Punk Song)&quot; is a photo montage with some performance video. 
        Both are now hitting heavy rotation on M2. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>Is This It?</i> is an exceptional album, of which &quot;Last 
        Nite&quot; is the glowing centerpiece and melodic highlight. The Strokes 
        don't really sound like anyone else in the modern rock scene. They're 
        more of a throwback to the Sixties. They play simple rock and roll with 
        punching drums and a very noticeable rhythm guitar. Lead singer Julian 
        Casablancas sings through a device that distorts his vocals. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Songs like &quot;The Modern Age,&quot; &quot;Soma,&quot; 
        and &quot;Barely Legal&quot; help make <i>Is This It?</i> a great record 
        that I play constantly. The songs do sound sort of the same, which is 
        the Strokes' biggest flaw. But the band's approach is refreshing, and 
        if they're not quite single-handedly saving rock and roll, they're definitely 
        fighting on the right side. &quot;Last Nite&quot; sticks out the most 
        because it's one of the catchiest rock songs of the year. &quot;Someday&quot; 
        is in a similar vein. The rockers &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; and &quot;Take 
        It Or Leave It&quot; are also standouts. <br>

          <td><font size="2">B.R.M.C., which formed in San Francisco in 1998, 
            named themselves after the motorcycle gang in the movie <i>The Wild 
            One. </i>(Courtesy <a href="http://www.blackrebelmotorcycleclub.com">here</a>)</font></td>

      </table>
      <p align="left">&quot;Whatever Happened to My Rock 'n' Roll&quot; is actually 
        the most atypical song on the B.R.M.C. album. The opening tracks &quot;Love 
        Burns&quot; and &quot;Red Eyes And Tears&quot; are better, and much more 
        representative of the album. <i>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</i> is a collection 
        of fuzzy, droning, slow rock n' roll songs four to six minutes long. The 
        trippier tracks on the Verve's 1997 smash <i>Urban Hymns</i>, like &quot;Catching 
        the Butterfly,&quot; would fit in here perfectly. B.R.M.C. has a darker 
        feel and catchier choruses, and, though its highs aren't as high as the 
        Verve's, their album is superior. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The overblown epics that populate the middle of the album 
        may be the best. In &quot;White Palms&quot; the band sings about Jesus, 
        fills spaces between the guitar buzz with speaking voices much like those 
        that haunt Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>, and fades into an 
        acoustic coda. &quot;As Sure As the Sun,&quot; and &quot;Rifles&quot; 
        are both amazing. Then they chill out starting with &quot;Too Real&quot; 
        and head for another, calmer bout with Christ in the album-ending &quot;Salvation.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club</i> and <i>Is This It?</i> 
        are the best debuts I've heard this year (other than the albums by Icelandic 
        whale-pop crooners Sigur R&oacute;s and Scottish rockers Idlewild, which 
        don't count because they were technically released before 2001). The British 
        had them first. But you can have them too. Buy these albums.</p>
