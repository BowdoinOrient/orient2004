        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's campus was recently the site of several incidents 
        involving acts of assault and vandalism. &quot;Last Sunday afternoon, 
        we were contacted by a student [who] advised us of an assault that had 
        occurred the previous night,&quot; Assistant Director of Security Michael 
        Brown said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;She indicated that while walking near the Harpswell 
        Apartments, she and her friends were approached by a group of juveniles. 
        In the course of interviewing her, it was determined that an assault had 
        occurred against her roommate and another student who was walking with 
        them,&quot; he said<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The female student declined to file a police report, so 
        Security attempted to contact with the other student mentioned in the 
        incident. Security confirmed that the other student, a male, had also 
        been assaulted on Saturday, but the student also opted not to file a report. 
        While the identities of those involved were not released, Brown said that 
        the victims had been confirmed as Bowdoin students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That same night, four cars were vandalized shortly after 
        a group of juveniles, similar to the descriptions provided by the victims, 
        were asked to leave an off-campus residence. &quot;There are also some 
        reports that this group was involved in the attempted theft of a beer 
        tap at two separate locations, one of which was on campus,&quot; Brown 
        said. &quot;There are no clear indications of motive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Security received reports of two other possible incidents 
        involving assault, only one of which it was able to confirm on Thursday. 
        The incident was perpetrated by a group of juveniles who match the descriptions 
        from the other incidents, which also occurred on Harpswell Avenue. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Brown said that since all events are believed to have taken 
        place between 11:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. along the same street, Security 
        believes they are connected in some way. He added that descriptions of 
        individuals involved all seem to match.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">None of those responsible have been apprehended, however. 
        &quot;Our efforts have been hindered by the delayed reports and a reluctance 
        to file police reports,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Because of the nature 
        of the crimes, the Brunswick Police Department is best suited to actively 
        investigate these complaints. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Police reports were filed in regards to the vandalism 
        to the motor vehicles, but not in any of the incidents of assault,&quot; 
        he continued. &quot;In the absence of a report, the full resources of 
        the Police Department cannot be employed to resolve this case. We've advised 
        them of the incidents, but have to exclude any identifiable information 
        about the students involved.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The security team is able to further investigate on the 
        College's behalf, but Brown said that its results would be limited to 
        criminal trespass charges and the like. &quot;I hope that as we near a 
        resolution in this matter, and the identification of the perpetrators, 
        the victims might consider the other options available to them,&quot; 
        he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Currently our efforts are focused on gathering as 
        much information about these incidents, and perhaps others that have not 
        yet been reported,&quot; he continued. &quot;We will be exploring some 
        patrol alternatives in certain areas to increase our effectiveness in 
        areas adjacent to the campus.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is unclear whether the victims knew any of their assailants. 
        &quot;I remain optimistic that somebody on campus may have been familiar 
        with at least one member of the group,&quot; Brown said. &quot;They appear 
        to have spent a significant amount of time in the area, but it is unknown 
        if they were invited or were merely exploiting the relatively open atmosphere 
        of the Bowdoin campus.&quot;<br>
