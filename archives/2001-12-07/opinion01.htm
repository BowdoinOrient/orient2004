        <font size="2">TODD BUELL<br>
        </font><br>
        Lost among the coverage of George Harrison's death was another milestone 
        from the United Kingdom. Last Friday was Winston Churchill's birthday. 
        I was alerted to this anniversary by one of my government professors who 
        wittily exhorted her class to find a record player and imbibe both in 
        Winston's wisdom and in his &quot;medicinal&quot; brandy. Recognizing 
        both the school's ban on hard alcohol and my own dearth of a record player, 
        I was forced to peruse the internet and find a site appropriately named 
        WinstonChurchill.org. It was here where I read in full text the great 
        rhetorician's unforgettable &quot;we shall fight on the beaches&quot; 
        speech and realized the need for our current president and his administration 
        to seek the sagacity of Britain's leader in our time of war.</p>
      <p>Although most people have heard Winston's raspy and determined voice 
        utter the proclamation of Britain's resiliency through the war, an earlier 
        part of the speech carries perhaps greater importance today. It guides 
        us as we debate the appropriate powers of the attorney general and the 
        president to hold military tribunals. It is here where Churchill explains 
        the appropriateness of adopting &quot;measures of increasing stringency&quot; 
        against those who harm Great Britain. At this point Great Britain, was 
        not only suffering under the peril of the Nazi blitzkrieg but also bracing 
        for what appeared to be an inevitable axis invasion. </p>
      <p>The same is true in this country as America seeks not only to defeat 
        the Taliban in Afghanistan but also resolve to eliminate terrorism both 
        here and abroad. In that spirit, President Bush announced military tribunals 
        would be used to try criminals connected to the terrorist attacks. This 
        proclamation by the President has received much criticism. Ralph Neas 
        of the liberal interest group &quot;People for the American Way&quot; 
        conjectured that military tribunals are a &quot;relentless assault on 
        constitutional rights and civil liberties.&quot; He and other critics 
        argue that by removing these trials from civilian courts, we are denying 
        the defendants adequate legal counsel and soiling the sacred principles 
        of the constitution. </p>
      <p>In an excellent New York Times editorial published on November 30th, 
        President Bush's chief counsel, Alberto Gonzalez, explains the necessity 
        of tribunals and answers the accusations of critics. </p>
      <p>In military courts, the defendants are adequately protected. Historically 
        military lawyers successfully acquitted German soldiers during World War 
        II. Contrary to the popular whim, President Bush did not order that all 
        tribunal proceedings be held in secret. Rather the doors are shut only 
        when classified information is being entered as evidence. As Morton Kondracke 
        points out in his November 29th article in Roll Call magazine, it was 
        this releasing of evidence during the trial of those accused of bombing 
        the World Trade Center in 1993 that allowed Osama Bin Laden to discover 
        that our government was monitoring his phone calls. Consequently, Bin 
        Laden ended his telephone communication and we lost a key intelligence 
        advantage. Therefore, it is imperative that this sort of sensitive information 
        not be released to the general public and military tribunals are the best 
        way to assure this protection.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court has ruled military tribunals to be constitutional. 
        It did so during World War II when President Roosevelt employed tribunals 
        to try eight Nazi saboteurs who had invaded our shores. </p>
      <p>The attacks on the World Trade Center were an act of war, and our president 
        commensurately has declared &quot;War on Terrorism.&quot; Therefore it 
        is imperative that our government exercise all necessary options in bringing 
        the individuals responsible for terrorist attacks to justice without compromising 
        our national security. It is equally necessary that the rights of those 
        accused be protected. Military tribunals offer the safety of a closed 
        proceeding if necessary, but also the competence of military lawyers protecting 
        the rights of those accused. </p>
      <p>Therefore President Bush is justified in allowing military tribunals. 
        They expedite a challenge that Churchill recognized during the Second 
        World War: the imperative of knowing that &quot;we are going to govern 
        the country and fight the war.&quot; In our language, that means expanding 
        judicial authority in extraordinary times while remaining within the bounds 
        of the constitution. Despite critics, President Bush is prudently doing 
        just that. </p>
      <p>May we all raise a glass in celebration.</p>
