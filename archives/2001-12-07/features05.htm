        <font size="2">LUDWIG VAN RANG</font><font size="2"><br>
        ALUMNUS WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">Arriving at San Francisco Airport on 25 November 1963, three 
        days after John F. Kennedy's assassination, the feeling of doom and gloom 
        was palpable. Pictures of the late President bordered in black were everywhere. 
        They gave me a feeling of having returned to a country not only in mourning, 
        but in deep shock. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Neither, however, it seemed, was shared by all Americans. 
        When told the news, children at a school in Dallas, reportedly, had clapped. 
        And a neighbor of Nellie's at Carmel seemed not to be too upset either. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Invited to her house for Thanksgiving dinner, with the holiday 
        spirit dampened (as this year) by a national tragedy, Florence started 
        mouthing opinions clearly originating from the right-wing John Birch Society 
        to which her late husband had belonged. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kennedy had been a &quot;communist sympathizer,&quot; she 
        claimed, a willing tool of the world-wide &quot;communist conspiracy.&quot; 
        Moreover, she had actually seen him once, on the golf course at the Del 
        Monte Country Club on the Monterey Peninsula, wearing differently colored 
        socks-imagine! One of them presumably red, I laughed, but Florence was 
        not amused. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I had first heard the name John Birch while in the Army. 
        There had been a big scandal when it became known the Commanding General 
        of an armored division stationed in Germany had ordered propaganda material 
        by the John Birch Society to be distributed to the troops. He was relieved 
        of his command, no doubt with President Kennedy's approval. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A Republican, but of the liberal species all but extinct 
        now, Nellie was as shocked by the assassination as most people. As for 
        the GOP's next candidate for President, she hadn't made up her mind yet. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The two main contenders were Senator Barry Goldwater, considered 
        a right-winger (though not an extremist) and Governor Nelson Rockefeller, 
        considered a liberal-a term which took on a slightly derogatory connotation 
        when uttered by the likes of Goldwater. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During the California Primary the following spring, I took 
        Nellie to hear Rockefeller speak at the Monterey Fairgrounds. The hall 
        was packed. A heavy-set, but nimble man, &quot;Rocky&quot; came bouncing 
        in grabbing people's hands, patting them on the back and saying, &quot;Hi, 
        feller, good to see ya,&quot; trying to sound folksy. Despite this, he 
        came across as an East Coast establishment politician, not &quot;sincere&quot; 
        enough, conservatives out West thought. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goldwater, who narrowly won the primary, famously quipped 
        he wished he could saw the Eastern seaboard off and float it out so sea. 
        Though I thought him quite likeable in a way, I favored Rockefeller. Neither, 
        of course stood a chance against LBJ. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What was I going to do with my life, Nellie asked. How about 
        going back to graduate school?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I had thought of enrolling at the University of California 
        at Berkeley, I told her, to complete my MA in literature. Then, someone 
        told me about a newly founded school, just a few miles from Carmel, the 
        Monterey Institute for Advanced Studies.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the impressive-sounding name, the Institute had 
        only a few dozen students and a handful of teaching staff, presided over 
        by Dr. Samuel Knoll, a German-Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute; living with 
        his American wife, reputedly rich and behind the venture, at Palo Alto. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Told of my interest in politics, Knoll suggested I should 
        work towards a degree in political science. To start with, I might like 
        to take a course in modern European history, taught by himself, and one 
        in Chinese philosophy taught by a refugee from Red China, also teaching 
        at the Army Language School in Monterey. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both men spoke English with a strong accent, Knoll pronouncing 
        his R's in guttural German fashion, and the Chinese professor (whose name 
        I forget) turning them into L's. At times the latter was so difficult 
        to understand, it was impossible to follow him. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, I started cutting classes. In the end, I dropped out, 
        as I had at Columbia following my bout of hepatitis. It was the end of 
        my academic career, once and for all. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of course, as always when making such decisions, there was 
        a personal factor involved. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My black actor friend from New York, Ronald, was back in, 
        or about to come back into my life, having outlasted (or outwitted) Helga, 
        who was not long ago my intended GI-bride. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As readers of my previous series may recall, Ron had had 
        to undergo major spinal surgery for something at first thought to have 
        been multiple sclerosis. Now, the symptoms had come back. He would have 
        to have another major operation, he told me. Would he like to come out 
        to California for his convalescence, I said trying to cheer him up. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next, I had to break the news to Nellie, in her eighties 
        by then, and rapidly going blind. I used to read to her, but now she was 
        getting &quot;records for the blind,&quot; books read by professionals, 
        such as Victor Hugo's Les Miserables, one of her favorite novels. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I told her I was going to try and get a job in Los Angeles, 
        I told her. Though willing to let me go, she was unhappy about me giving 
        up my studies yet again, she said. &quot;But don't worry,&quot; she added, 
        &quot;tools will be put into your hands.&quot; I always wondered when 
        and what sort exactly. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With his neck in plaster, poor Ron looked terrible when 
        I met him at LA Airport. But he was visibly brightened when seeing the 
        apartment I had rented in a block with swimming pool just off Hollywood 
        Boulevard. I think he already saw his name emblazoned in golden letters 
        on the sidewalk.</p>
