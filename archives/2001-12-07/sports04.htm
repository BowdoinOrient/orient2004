      <p align="left"><b>Michael Jordan</b>: If you see a pair of Air Jordan knees 
        in your local S-Mart (remember, &quot;shop smart - shop S-Mart&quot;), 
        pick up this special gift idea for Michael. Tendonitis in a bum right 
        knee has hampered Jordan's play all season. Without these knees, Jordan 
        will miss significant portions of the season icing his creaky knees.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, if you find vintage Air Jordan 1990 knees, put 
        them under Michael's tree. We all know he needs them if wants to reassert 
        himself as the greatest ballplayer in all the lands.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Charles Barkley</b>: The former 76'er, Sun, and Rocket 
        recently hinted that he is planning to return to the NBA alongside Michael 
        Jordan. After all, he feels sorry that MJ is struggling to win with a 
        Wizards team void of veteran talent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, what does Sir Charles need? A weight loss program - 
        that kind that you see on infomercials where the flabby old guy gets a 
        rock-hard six-pack. After retiring, Barkley has ballooned past 300 pounds. 
        In order to seriously consider a comeback of his own, Chuckie readily 
        admits that he must lose at least 25 pounds.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Bob Davie</b>: This recently fired Notre Dame head coach 
        wants future employment for the holiday season. It wasn't his fault that 
        an untalented bunch of Fighting Irish failed to make a bowl game. Did 
        anyone really expect them to?<br>
        ABC Broadcasting: As long as we are on the subject of the Fighting Irish, 
        would someone please present this station with a different lineup of teams 
        for Saturday's college football - notably, remove the Irish.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Why must spectators and couch potaters be forced to watch 
        the same Notre Dame game every weekend? They aren't good, or particularly 
        fun to watch. The school has a great football history (we all love Rudy), 
        but currently they are not competive.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Antoine Walker</b>: Don't waste your money on game because 
        this power forward already has plenty of it. He does, however, need a 
        major dose of maturity and a team-first attitude. Antoine launched over 
        600 hundred three-pointers last season - that's over six per game from 
        your power forward.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Celtics would be a much stronger team if Walker stopped 
        heaving up trey after trey and displayed maturity on the court. You don't 
        have to heave up a half-dozen threes per game to be an effective player.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Jason Giambi</b>: Do Harley Davidsons and a New York 
        Yankees uniform mesh? Giambi thinks so. This Oakland Athletics slugger 
        and former American League MVP is on the verge of donning a Yankee jersey 
        for the rest of his career. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Do the Yankees need to secure the best free agent in the 
        market every year? Last year, Mike Mussina defected to New York and quickly 
        become the ace of the staff for a modest (baseball terms) $85 million. 
        If Giambi follows the Moose, let's put coal is his stocking for making 
        baseball uncompetitive. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>U.S. Hockey Team</b>: This group of NHL superstars already 
        embarrassed themselves and their country in Nagano - let's hope they don't 
        do it in Salt Lake City. What do they need for the 2002 Olympics? A healthy 
        respect for their competitors and an appreciation for the spirit of the 
        Olympic games. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During the 1998 Games, an arrogant and hung-over bunch of 
        Americans failed to medal, but did succeed in destroying their living 
        accommodations. This is a team in need of vindication for their disgraceful 
        performance and representation in Japan.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>David Stern</b>: This NBA Commissioner desperately needs 
        to be fined - soon. He has leveled out thousands of dollars worth of fines 
        this season. Players whose shorts drop below their kneecaps or who criticize 
        the referees are amongst Stern's favorite targets.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If a host of people fine Stern $5000 dollars for the holidays, 
        maybe the Commish will relinquish some of his control over the NBA and 
        let players wear what they want and speak their mind - within reason of 
        course.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers</b>: As November closed, 
        the Lakers sported a 15-1 record and established themselves as the supreme 
        team in the NBA. What could this team possibly need? They already have 
        the best center, the best guard, and the best coach.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A prime-time soap opera is a great gift idea for the two-time 
        world champions. Imagine the series unfold: In the season premier, Shaq 
        changes into a pair of size 32 shorts despite his size 54 waist band. 
        He then dominates on the court, cracks a few jokes afterwards, and extricates 
        himself from his skimpy shorts.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second episode starts off laughably with Shaq declaring 
        that he would like to be a sheriff - only in L.A. However, the episode 
        hits a more serious note as Kobe and Shaq begin to bicker at each other. 
        However, Zen Master Phil Jackson quickly saves the day, and the Lakers 
        win big again.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The intrigue and story lines are all there - all they need 
        now is a sitcom.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Kurt Warner</b>: The most talented quarterback in the 
        National Football League needs a new commercial because his Campbell's 
        Chunky Soup ad freaks me out. In this line of ads, professional football 
        players like Donovan McNabb, Terrell Davis, and now Warner receive bowls 
        of Chunky Soup from their mothers in order to be able to perform at an 
        optimum level.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, Kurt Warner's parents tragically died before he 
        made it big in the NFL. Thus, watching Warner's supposed mother pour bowls 
        of soup strikes me as very eerie. He needs Campbell's to change the ad 
        format, or someone please offer him a new product to advertise - preferably 
        one that does not include his dead mother.</p>
