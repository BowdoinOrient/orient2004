      <p align="left"><font size="5">A report from the IM ice</font><br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>&quot;There is only one rule out here, and that's go hard or go home. 
        If we don't see blood on the ice at the end of a match, we know there's 
        a problem.&quot; These are the words of Commissioner David E. Mountcastle, 
        master of Bowdoin's supreme winter athletic endeavor, intramural hockey. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each winter, hundreds of Bowdoin students take to the ice to compete 
        in intensive and often brutal competition, and this year promises to be 
        no different. <br>
        Each team is striving for that most coveted of trophies, the gold-plated 
        Andrew Kaplan Memorial IM Hockey Cup. Standing three times as high as 
        the Stanley Cup and almost twice as wide, its prominently-located display 
        case in the Dayton Ice Arena is a shrine of veneration for the noble athletes 
        that compete to have their names grace its shiny surface.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This year's action has gotten off to an amazing start. Teams like Old 
        Number 7 (led by that crushing dude Evan Dewhirst '03), Hookers on Ice, 
        and Hired Help have leapt to the forefront of the standings after early 
        victories, while the Cleveland Steamers (obviously named after the famed 
        watercraft), Coleman Blades, and TPS Memo have had slower starts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>One thing that has characterized this year's action over others has been 
        the prominence of private franchise teams. &quot;Usually the best teams 
        are the ones from the social houses and dorms,&quot; quipped Assistant 
        Commissioner (and Residential Life lackey) Billy Soares '02. &quot;I guess 
        our privatization scheme is finally bearing fruit with so many independently-based 
        teams in the lead this year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I hope this doesn't mean they cancel the Social House system,&quot; 
        he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While President Mills' office issued a statement saying that it was &quot;very 
        disappointed&quot; with the performance of the school-sponsored teams, 
        it also assured us that all first year proctors had been threatened with 
        expulsion if they didn't improve the performance of the school-based teams, 
        and that the social house system would not be repealed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The season itself was in danger of being cancelled before it even started. 
        Our inside source at Residential Life, &quot;Bobby G,&quot; as he identifies 
        himself, gave the <i>Orient</i> inside information concerning leaks to 
        the media regarding a suspected-steroid and grade-fixing scandal as the 
        cause of this year's cancellation of the A-League season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If true, these allegations would not only violate all NESCAC recruiting 
        and academic practices, but certainly also bring charges of human rights 
        abuses from the World Court in Geneva. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Commissioner Mountcastle hotly denied these allegations in a tense interview. 
        &quot;That's a total fabrication. I can't believe you'd print crap like 
        that!&quot; he said. &quot;I would never condone steroids or grade fixing. 
        I swear, the reason we're not having an A-League season is that there 
        was simply not enough interest. End of story.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Though a cursory examination of the evidence seems to point to Mountcastle's 
        explanation, there have been complaints to the contrary. Junior Ed Bair 
        complained of being suddenly and mysteriously &quot;knocked out of A-League,&quot; 
        while Adam &quot;Sack of A's&quot; Corman acridly commented, &quot;Sure, 
        they didn't have enough teams. That has about as much validity as claiming 
        to get drunk of O'Douls.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, this year has only seen the B- and C-League action, which has intensified 
        the speed and physicality of the action. Old Number 7 has led the B-League 
        action with their sobering power. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, there are concerns that losing silent junior Seth Obed to an 
        international hockey squad will hamper the team's chances for success. 
        <br>
        On the other end of the spectrum, Baxter B has been mired at the bottom 
        of the B-League. Team Captain Rachel Jones '04 claims that they have a 
        new plan for success in the post-Christmas action reportedly involving 
        full-body spandex suits. The <i>Orient</i> shudders to consider the implications.<br>
        C-League has seen the most intense competition so far. With a variety 
        of skill levels present, it's almost guaranteed that the ambulance will 
        have to be called after each game. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The best team so far, without a doubt, has been Hookers on Ice. Led by 
        Asst. Commissioner Soares (who received a special pass from Lily to play), 
        the Hookers have smashed all competition that has dared to face them. 
        When asked about why they were playing so hard, senior ringer Mike &quot;Doza&quot; 
        Carlson said cryptically, &quot;We're doing it for Val. You just wouldn't 
        understand our loss after they stole our little white friend. I miss him 
        so.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Other fine performances on the team, from spicy Junior Rambo Miller and 
        first-year sensation &quot;Egon&quot; have rounded out the team. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Juniors Tim &quot;Yanni&quot; Lazarus and Hugh &quot;Hank&quot; Hill, 
        however, have been the real power behind the team. Their skill, speed, 
        and grace have caused many to compare them to figure skaters crossbred 
        with linebackers. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;These guys are by and far the best players on the team,&quot; Soares 
        said. &quot;Sure, they don't know how to ice-skate, but ever since we 
        gave Yanni Flabio's anti-rugburn knee pads and tied a pillow to Hank's 
        ass so he wouldn't break his tailbone, they have been a clearly dominant 
        force on the ice.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>In other C-League action, the Ruggers on Ice team has faired better than 
        expected. Under the slicked-back leadership of senior Lindsey Pettingill, 
        the girls have spanked their competition with a relish. They've been hampered 
        only by sophomore Ashley Inderfurth's repeated and unexplained attempts 
        to cannonball through the actual ice itself, said inside team sources.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In closing, the words of brain-damaged sophomore Warren Dubitsky seem 
        appropriate. &quot;You know, I really have no idea how to skate or use 
        a hockey stick. So I just strip off my shirt and slide around the ice 
        on my belly,&quot; he said. <br>
        &quot;Yeah, they usually have to hogtie me and throw me in the trunk for 
        the ride to the hospital at the end of every match, but we win. That's 
        what really matters.&quot; <br>
        So even if you can't skate, come over and watch some intense IM hockey 
        action when you get a chance. Trust us, most of them can't skate either.<br>
