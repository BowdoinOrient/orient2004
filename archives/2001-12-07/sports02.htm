        Classic, falls to Bates</font><br>

      <p>The Bowdoin College men's basketball team enjoyed great success last 
        weekend in the Bowdoin-Bates Men's Basketball Classic. The team roundly 
        defeated both Suffolk University and Thomas College, and completed the 
        Classic as the only team without a loss.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears' four-game winning streak was broken on Wednesday, however, 
        in a close 68-63 loss to Bates.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the first game of the Bowdoin-Bates Classic, against Suffolk University 
        last Saturday, the team came home with a 72-60 victory. On the strength 
        of 51% shooting, the team ended the first half up 44-25. Although Suffolk 
        tried to mount a comeback in the second half, Bowdoin continued its tenacious 
        play and never let go of the lead.<br>
      </p>

      <p>Senior guard Greg Orlicz had the hot hand for Bowdoin, collecting a team-high 
        25 points with a combination of good three-point shooting (4-7) and strong 
        drives to the basket.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The next day, the Bears took on Thomas College and were thoroughly dominant 
        in a 105-37 win. Bowdoin outscored Thomas by a 61-18 margin in the second 
        half.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Five Bowdoin players pulled in ten points or more toward the team's impressive 
        point total: T.J. McLeod '04, Danny Ginn '03, Hugh Coleman '02, Chris 
        Ranslow '02, and Sean Walker '05.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Things didn't end up as well at Bates on Wednesday, however. The Bears 
        fought their way through a close game and wound up on the losing end of 
        a 68-63 score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>First year Sean Walker said that the Bears made a few too many errors 
        against a talented Bobcat team. &quot;We led for most of the game, but 
        they converted on a few of our mistakes,&quot; he said. &quot;They made 
        some important foul shots and we just never seemed to get that one important 
        basket to keep us ahead.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Orlicz poured in 25 points for Bowdoin, while Ranslow added ten points 
        and ten rebounds of his own. &quot;Greg had another great game, especially 
        considering that he wasn't expected to play because of a recent knee injury,&quot; 
        Walker said. &quot;[First year] Mark Yakavonic also provided a spark off 
        the bench with several rebounds and some great blocked shots.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We performed as we had hoped on defense, for the most part,&quot; 
        he added. &quot;We forced them to take some bad shots and to lose their 
        composure at points. We also did a good job limiting their second shot 
        opportunities.&quot; <br>
        The team's record stands at 5-2 and the Bears have collected wins in four 
        of its last five games.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sophomore guard McLeod, who shot a perfect 4-4 from behind the arc on 
        his way to a team-high 15 points against Thomas, was enthusiastic in talking 
        about the team and its prospects for the season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Our team is really playing great basketball this year,&quot; he 
        said. &quot;We have players who can contribute to this team in unique, 
        special ways, and we have really gelled as a team.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears play tomorrow, when they travel to Norwich for a 4:00 game. 
        They break for winter vacation after that matchup, and won't play again 
        until January 5th, when they face Babson on the road.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We just want to get a victory to go into break 6-2,&quot; Walker 
        said. &quot;This will put us in a good position to keep winning once the 
        NESCAC season opens up in January.&quot;<br>
