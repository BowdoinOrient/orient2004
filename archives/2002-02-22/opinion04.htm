      <p align="left"><font size="5">Being gay at Bowdoin</font><br>
        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Bowdoin College is a diverse and multi-faceted environment, 
        and lately I've been thinking that I've really addressed only one of the 
        many groups represented here. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I try to write from experience, but as a heterosexual female, my experience 
        is, in some ways, very limited (although perhaps not so limited in that 
        realm, as my parents have come to realize through my column). However, 
        we have sizeable gay and lesbian communities at the College, and there 
        is no reason for them to be overlooked in a column about sex and romance 
        here. So I would like to devote a couple of installments to BEING GAY 
        AT BOWDOIN.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's very common for young men and women to come out when they get to 
        college. They may have felt trapped into roles (or closets) by their friends 
        and families at home, and the changes of college often allow feelings 
        to surface that may have been suppressed, whether consciously or unconsiously. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ellen came out her freshman year. She was worried that there wouldn't 
        be a gay community, &quot;and if there was, I imagined it to be kinda 
        underground and secretive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Regardless, Ellen knew that this was what she had to do; it had been 
        building in many ways for a while. She had always felt some sort of draw 
        to women that she knew was &quot;weird&quot; (her word) for heterosexual 
        women, but it hadn't actually occurred to her that she might be gay.<br>
      </p>
      <p>At some point, though, &quot;things just started to make sense, and the 
        more I thought about them, I was like, 'Wow, I think I'm gay.'&quot; She 
        found that many of her new straight friends were shocked-when they met 
        her, they had assumed she was just like them. Not to say that she wasn't 
        in many ways, but there was no way around the fact that while she liked 
        men and women both as friends as they did, she was also attracted to women. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Stanford came out his sophomore year. He'd had a long-term girlfriend 
        in high school and had always sort of assumed that he was straight, but 
        things slowly started to come into focus with the changes college life 
        brought. </p>
      <p>The summer between his freshman and sophomore years, he admitted-only 
        to his very closest friends-that he might be bisexual, and by the beginning 
        of that school year, was pretty much openly gay. &quot;I just told my 
        good friends and figured that sooner or later everyone else would know, 
        which they do by now.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The thing is,&quot; Stanford confides, &quot;it's not like I'm 
        part of some 'gay' group. I like my friends and I don't think that should 
        change based on who I am attracted to sexually.&quot; And on the whole, 
        his friends have been enormously supportive, accepting his coming out 
        without question.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What Stanford did not find was a closely-knit gay male community. &quot;I 
        have a pretty good idea of who all the out gay guys are at Bowdoin, but 
        I mean, for the most part, I have my friends and they have theirs. And, 
        you know, when the groups overlap, they do, and when they don't, they 
        don't.&quot; </p>
      <p>Ellen had a quite different experience. It seems that beneath the pines 
        the lesbian community is much larger and more unified than the gay male 
        community. &quot;There is a pretty substantial community of girls at Bowdoin 
        who identify as 'gay,'&quot; she says.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Girls who come out at Bowdoin are warmly embraced and find an outpouring 
        of support. For whatever reason, the gay male community at Bowdoin lacks 
        this cohesive 'warm fuzziness.'<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ellen and Stanford have both been lucky in that they haven't faced much 
        prejudice in the Bowdoin bubble. Ellen has not been subjected to derogatory 
        name-calling and apart from Stanford's friends teasing him that one of 
        his sweaters is &quot;really gay,&quot; he has not dealt with any discriminatory 
        confrontations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But, as Ellen realizes, &quot;thinly veiled, completely asinine&quot; 
        ignorance does exist. Not that Polar Bears aren't considerate or would 
        ever want to call someone a name or degrade a personal choice, but &quot;gay&quot; 
        is still a term used for &quot;stupid&quot; and we all scream cheers at 
        the Bowdoin-Colby hockey game that would make a homosexual person feel 
        uncomfortable, even if we mean to offend only the Mules.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stanford recalls an incident once when an acquaintance, Josh, asked a 
        mutual friend, right in front of Stanford, &quot;Is he, like, out?&quot; 
        The friend replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; There was a long pause.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;So does he have, like, a, uh, ahem, partner?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Yeah, he's kind of seeing someone. Why don't you ask him yourself?&quot; 
      </p>
      <p> &quot;Oh, ahh, well&#133;.&quot; Josh sort of coughed, looked at Stanford, 
        then walked away.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's occurances like this, where Josh was trying to be tolerant and polite, 
        that can be inordinately awkward for someone who is gay. Stanford could 
        tell that Josh was uncomfortable with his homosexuality; at the same time, 
        he could also tell that Josh would never actually say so, whether out 
        of amity towards Stanford or just out of fear of being labeled a bigot. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coming out is an enormous step in the life of a gay individual. Some 
        men and women live their whole lives in the proverbial closet because 
        they don't have the courage to admit to their friends, families, and themselves 
        that they are homosexual. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So I will conclude this week that no matter how supportive Bowdoin claims 
        to be and, in its defense, tries to be, it is still hard to be gay here. 
        Homosexuality is really only one characteristic of a person, much like 
        religion or socioeconomic background. It can have as large or as small 
        an effect on a person as factors like this, and it's sad when some people 
        don't realize this or are consumed by intolerance. I am very impressed 
        with the ease and comfort Stanford and Ellen seem to have found in their 
        friends, but only wish that everyone could be so cool about it.</p>
