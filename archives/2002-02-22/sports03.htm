        <font size="2">EILEEN SCHNEIDER<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">A brisk wind swirled across the Dudley Coe quad, but an 
        agile Lindy Stanley kept her footing on the ice rink that was once a walkway. 
        Determined to make her meeting with Dr. Benson in Dudley Coe, Stanley 
        held the fate of the women's squash season on her shoulders. No, literally, 
        on her shoulders. Stanley has played in the number three position for 
        the Polar Bears this winter, but has not been cleared to play a match 
        since January 13th because of the potential for head injury. Her presence 
        at the National Championships would bolster Bowdoin's inexperienced line-up 
        and wreak some havoc with the teams ranked above us.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Stanley asked Dr. Jeff for clearance to play if she wore 
        a helmet. The general shadiness of having a player with a helmet did not 
        faze head squash coach Tomas Fortson, who said that &quot;Oh, that one 
        right there, its got everything you want in a peanut; salty, crunchy, 
        flavorful.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a careful decision, Dr. Benson denied Stanley's request. 
        His position upholds Bowdoin's fine tradition of staff members who are 
        not swayed from professional and ethical paths by the bright lights and 
        glitz of intercollegiate women's squash. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With Stanley out of the line-up, The Bears turned to good 
        old fashioned hard work and butt-whoopin' to finish the weekend ranked 
        16th in the nation. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Leading off against Bates in Friday's first round, the girls 
        in black faced a challenge as Bates took 7-2 and 8-1 decisions in previous 
        contests. Friday's match marked the first time Bowdoin and Bates had met 
        this season with Bowdoin sporting white shirts instead of the preferred 
        black. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">#4 Sara &quot;are you going to eat your pickle?&quot; Kaufman 
        '02 remarked &quot;the whole 'bad-ass in black' thing really goes out 
        the window when we don't actually wear black. It's been a personal goal 
        this season to summon that intensity while wearing other colors&quot;. 
        Before her #8 match, Freshman Elizabeth &quot;Diplomatic Immunity&quot; 
        Davidson was heard to say &quot;Just give me a burlap sack and a racquet, 
        I'm here to hit the ball, no frills.&quot; Unfortunately, her pure style 
        was not enough as Davidson fell in three.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final 8-1 decision for Bates did not indicate the match 
        play. At the number-one slot Bowdoin captain Cristin &quot;Cookies&quot; 
        O'Brien '02 pushed her opponent, top 20 individual player Aisha Shah, 
        to a tiebreaker in their first game and took seven points in the second. 
        Number 3 Whitney &quot;cough cough&quot; Hodgkins closed out her Bates 
        opponent, avenging a four game defeat the week before. O'Brien and Hodgkins 
        set a standard for intense and determined play that was evident over the 
        weekend.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More determination and sass were needed in the Polar Bear's 
        Saturday match against #13 Middlebury, where many bears played their strongest 
        of the season. A tough Kara Oppenheim '04 at #9 commented, &quot;Let's 
        be honest, we were rockin' out there. I truly feel that the essence of 
        Women's International Professional Squash Association #83 Dana Betts'01 
        has been reincarnated in my person.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, Hodgkins again took an easy three-game win at 
        the third position. Playing in the number five position, sophomore Eileen 
        &quot;shut up, I write the articles and I will glorify my win if I want 
        to&quot; Schneider won her best outing of the season in five not-so-nail-biting 
        games, as the team match was already decided. The gifted Schneider won 
        only after saving three match points and winning a tiebreaker in the fifth 
        game.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the second position, Katie &quot;respect my&#133; Fettuccini&quot; 
        Irving '04 battled well, taking the second game to a tiebreaker, but could 
        not convert. Irving's match displayed her best pacing, shot making, and 
        technique of the season. If you see her around campus today, congratulate 
        her, and thank her for letting me borrow her blue shirt for the banquet.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the number one match, Captain Cristin O'Brien delivered 
        a five-game decision that actually did prompt some nail biting. A sequel 
        to her 4-game win in January, O'Brien took Midd's Sarah Herrup out back 
        and showed her what grace under pressure looked like. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Coming from a 5-8 deficit to take the fifth game 10-9 in 
        a tiebreaker, O'Brien's 100-minute epic wowed a packed crowd at Yale's 
        spiffy three glass-wall exhibition court.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sara Kaufman '02 took the court at #4 while the number-one 
        match still waged on. After falling by 1-9 decisions in the first two 
        games, Kaufman told her opponent to &quot;call me B.D. &quot;cause I'm 
        the bus driver, and I'm taking you to school&quot; as she sprinted to 
        a 9-3 third game and saved the match. Kaufman's method for the weekend 
        was constant depth and excellent movement, but Middlebury proved too tough 
        in the fourth and took the match. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Saturday evening brought a weekend highlight for some, and 
        a lifetime highlight for this reporter. The WISA banquet gets every squash 
        girl from every school in every division together for a dinner full of 
        black pants, sweater sets, loafers, and awards. This year Bowdoin did 
        have a sincere moment, as O'Brien was one of only three players in all 
        divisions of women's squash to be nominated for the Ann Wetzel Trophy. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Wetzel Trophy is given to the senior who began her squash 
        career in college and has improved to a nationally-competitive level while 
        exemplifying the characteristics of leadership and sportsmanship. The 
        Wetzel Trophy last came to Brunswick when it was awarded to Tara Dugan 
        '97.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sunday morning's competition brought heated contests for 
        divisional championships as well as third and fifth place playoffs. But 
        first, Bowdoin woke up the courts at 8:30 a.m. to take on Wellesley in 
        the 15th-place playoff. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Wellesley match started with Hodgkins taking her third 
        victory of the weekend, leaving her undefeated in tournament play. Melissa 
        &quot;I like sunsets, long walks, and weekends in Paris and New Haven&quot; 
        Miness '04 fell in the #6 slot after a solid performance. At number seven, 
        first year Sarah &quot;please get away from me, I'm trying to hydrate&quot; 
        Moran also fell 3-0 in her final battle of the season. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hoping to bring the Bears back into the match, Schneider 
        built a 2-0 lead in games and a 4-point lead in the third, and Irving 
        split the first two games 1-1 at the second slot. In a valuable lesson 
        on sportsmanship, Schneider lost her focus and blew the entire match after 
        complaining to the referee on a call. Don't do it kids, it's just not 
        cool. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's number one and four matches went on court with 
        the only two seniors in the lineup. Playing well in their last team matches, 
        Kaufman and O'Brien made smart shots and displayed the fitness they had 
        been working for this season. The Polar Bears were not victorious and 
        the final score was 8-1 Wellesley. Overall, a good weekend with some good 
        times, good squash, and good eats.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men's squash team faces Amherst in the first round of 
        team nationals on Friday morning at Harvard. Next weekend, O'Brien and 
        Irving will represent the women in individual championships at Princeton.
