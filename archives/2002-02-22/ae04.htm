        nothing more dramatic than a tiny restaurant on Maine Street or an ice

            has earned a reputation for carrying quality, independent films. (Nicole

      <p>John Favreau bought the small, one-screen Eveningstar Cinema on Maine 
        Street the same year that the Hoyts Corporation opened its ten-screen 
        multiplex in Cook's Corner. Since then, the owner and manager of the independent 
        theater has struggled to keep business up under the presence of the much 
        larger-and much stronger-commercial giant. &quot;Those first two years 
        were hard,&quot; Favreau said in an interview.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Today, however, the Eveningstar is still glowing from the success of 
        its two previous films, <i>Am&eacute;lie</i> and <i>In the Bedroom</i>, 
        and continues to fill up its seats and sofas with <i>Gosford Park</i>-yet 
        another in its tradition of critically-acclaimed films-this month. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Favreau attributes the Eveningstar's continued success to its growing 
        link with the Brunswick community. &quot;I have a good feel for what people 
        want to see,&quot; he said. As owner of an independent theater, Favreau 
        has the distinct advantage of being able to book films according to community 
        interest. Hoyts Brunswick, on the other hand, takes its movies and showtime 
        orders from Boston. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Favreau added that the Eveningstar has been part of Brunswick for over 
        twenty years, which is long enough for it to find its own niche audience-an 
        audience that doesn't necessarily cater to what Hoyts has to offer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Hoyts Cinemas currently operates 103 locations with 917 screens in twelve 
        U.S. states. Hoyts Brunswick, as part of such a powerful corporation, 
        gets the movies that are advertised on television-the films that get nationwide 
        attention and are therefore likely to make good money. Because Hoyts Brunswick 
        has to fill up its ten screens week after week, it operates under a kind 
        of block booking, a system which books films in large blocks that range 
        from the great to the mediocre.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Due to clearance laws, Hoyts Brunswick and the Eveningstar cannot show 
        the same movies at the same time. &quot;There's no competition,&quot; 
        Favreau said, &quot;which is bad for the audience because prices don't 
        go down.&quot; In addition, since Hoyts Brunswick has more access to the 
        more commercially advertised films, its block booking buying power allows 
        it to take some of the quality movies that the Eveningstar would want 
        to show.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;If there's a diamond in the rough,&quot; Favreau said, &quot;I 
        can't get it.&quot; One example is the surprise foreign hit <i>Crouching 
        Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>. &quot;We wanted that one,&quot; Favreau said, 
        &quot;but they took it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, since the Eveningstar books its films months in advance, it 
        sometimes beats Hoyts to some anticipated films. &quot;<i>Shakespeare 
        in Love</i> was probably our most successful film,&quot; Favreau said, 
        recollecting night after night of packed houses for the Best Picture of 
        1998 at his one-screen theater.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When asked what attracts people to his theater, Favreau replied, &quot;There's 
        a different atmosphere here-people come in, they know each other-it's 
        a community.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is this sense of community-manifest in its homely atmosphere, comfy 
        sofas, modest popcorn bags, and an honest acquaintance with the local 
        people-that makes the Eveningstar an integral part of Brunswick, and a 
        smart provider of quality films that the community appreciates.<br>
        Today the Brunswick entertainment battle continues, and the drama is as 
        thick as ever. The Eveningstar, though a small and humble contender, is 
        nonetheless wise, worthy, and unrelenting. In fact, John Favreau is enjoying 
        his small theater's cinematic crusade.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I've had a great opportunity to connect with the community,&quot; 
        he said, smiling from the wooden desk in the Eveningstar's tiny loft projection 
        room. &quot;It's been a blast.&quot;</p>
