        <font size="2">GENEVIEVE CREEDON</font></p>
      <p>&quot;What happens to a dream deferred?&quot; Langston Hughes wrote in 
        one of his most famous poems. The question resounds today, though perhaps 
        in a somewhat altered light. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The &quot;American dream&quot; has been one of the greatest and most 
        widely believed myths (or possibilities) of the past century. It brought 
        waves of immigrants into the United States and continues to attract them. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The post-Civil War era was certainly a fertile soil in which that American 
        dream could take root, and since the likes of Horatio Alger stories, there 
        has been no stopping its flourishing. The dream will always hold a strong 
        position in the culture of this country, but the erosion of it is undeniable. 
        <br>
        The words of Langston Hughes some forty years ago show us that the dream 
        has changed, and not only for a contingency of the population, but for 
        everyone. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Works by Theodore Drieser and Arthur Miller certainly cast a shadow on 
        the American dream early on in the 20th century. Literary recognition 
        of a changing phenomenon doesn't, however, always resound very strongly 
        until after the fact. Perhaps we've simply been waiting to see the actual 
        fading dream. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And now, we're seeing it. Enron undoubtedly marks the most public undoing 
        of an American dream obtained through deception. Our fascination with 
        the scandal mirrors similar fixations we've had in the past, most notably 
        the romance with Horatio Alger in his time. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The question becomes one of how that dream, so pure and just, has become 
        so distorted and tainted?<br>
      </p>
      <p>The question has many answers, including greed. The media have gained 
        a stronghold in their construction of America, and the American dream 
        has been their hook. The public wanted to hear about success and opportunity 
        once, but now we want soap operas, which the media give us freely. </p>
      <p>Enron will provide a whole new wave of information and deception for 
        future strivers after the new American dream, and as long as the media 
        capitalize on such scandals-as long as they plaster every newspaper's 
        front page with this improved version of a dream that seems to be long 
        lost-the thirst for the soap opera will continue, and we'll be facing 
        more than the end of a boom.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Some might argue that the American dream has already died. I would argue 
        that it cannot until our notions of America die. &quot;What happens to 
        a dream deferred?&quot; Is it not the greatest question we face right 
        now? <br>
      </p>
      <p>I don't mean to adhere to a pure and romantic vision of the American 
        dream, which is merely a notion that is widespread enough that most people 
        can understand it. The American dream began as a reflection of positive 
        innovation, desire, persistence-a set of values and an ideology that have 
        soured over the past century.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Or does it explode?&quot; Hughes concluded. It doesn't even matter 
        how Enron will be resolved, because we don't want to see the resolution. 
        We want to see the chaos, and when Enron is over, there will be others, 
        just as there were other Horatio Algers. There is more reason to believe 
        that the tendency is toward erosion rather than compromise. Between optimism 
        and pessimism lies realism. Even the explosions, however, have not changed 
        our course. Perhaps all we need is to stop seeking images and icons of 
        extremes that history has proven undesirable. </p>
