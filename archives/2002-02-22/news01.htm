        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin is not seeing the decline in applications from geographically 
        far-flung candidates that many American universities have noticed since 
        September 11.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While many schools have reported lower interest levels from 
        students in distant parts of the country or overseas, Dean of Admissions 
        Jim Miller said that applications for the Class of 2006 were no different 
        from those of last year. &quot;To be honest, we were expecting changes, 
        and we haven't seen them,&quot; he said. &quot;The geography of the applicant 
        pool is almost identical to that of last year.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Miller also said that students from a wide range of locations, 
        both far and near, applied to Bowdoin last fall in the face of travel 
        uncertainty. &quot;We're getting people from all over the place, from 
        places where we thought traveling might be a bit of an issue,&quot; he 
        said. &quot;That was a bit of a surprise. We were worried about a sort 
        of regionalization of our applicant base, but it hasn't happened.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Miller, however, the initial similarity of 
        applicants does not nessecarily indicate a similar entering class. &quot;I 
        still think that the September 11 fallout hasn't been felt yet,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;Parents are going to think very hard about this in April, 
        when students get admitted to colleges all over the country.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Parents may consider the implications of sending children 
        farther away to school-several long flights home each year for holidays 
        and breaks present new risks. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think that in April, when parents are looking at 
        admission offers, that's when the real caution will kick in,&quot; Miller 
        said. &quot;That's what we're holding our breaths about.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Immediately after the attacks, there were some who were 
        openly concerned about traveling to school. &quot;Right after September 
        11, I had two or three contacts from people wanting to talk about transferring, 
        one out of Washington and one out of New York,&quot; Miller said. &quot;I 
        think they were looking for an area that was safer, or out of the major 
        'line of fire.'&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Miller said that a trend seems likely to appear in 
        April decisions, he also acknowledged that the College has no evidence 
        of this from acceptances earlier this year. &quot;Early Decision I and 
        II-we didn't see any change in geography,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We may see a pattern, but it depends on how unsafe 
        the world gets...it's a tough call.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anxiety exists abroad as well and has dissuaded some students 
        from attending American colleges and universities. According to Miller, 
        this trend wasn't reflected in this fall's applicant pool. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I have talked to colleges who have talked with counselors 
        from other schools abroad, and there is some concern about sending students 
        [to the United States],&quot; he said. &quot;We have seen a small dropoff 
        in international students, but a fair number of schools have seen some 
        pretty significant decline; it really didn't happen here. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Generally, there is concern about studying abroad 
        in America, but that's not a Bowdoin-specific problem,&quot; he added.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The admissions office plans to continue its pursuit of foreign 
        students in efforts to diversify, while taking safety concerns into consideration. 
        &quot;There's a great wealth of talent internationally,&quot; Miller said. 
        &quot;We do a lot of direct mailing to international students, we're planning 
        a trip to Asia either this spring or next fall; it's something a lot of 
        colleges are doing.&quot;</p>
