      <p align="left">Let it be made clear that the Bowdoin Women's Hockey Team 
        owns the best hockey record in the school right now, standing at a phenomenal 
        19-3-1. As fabulous as this is, it is a painful fact that there is more 
        of a cult following surrounding &quot;the Hawk&quot; (now identified to 
        be an immature Red-Tail) that attacked a seagull outside Smith Union than 
        your own Women's Hockey team. I know having a nationally ranked team is 
        nothing new when you go to Bowdoin College and a pile of white feathers 
        is, but if you crave carnage this is the team for you. In 6 periods of 
        hockey against rival Colby College, the scoring was a lopsided 12-2. Trust 
        me, a pile of destroyed mule hair is more satisfying to look at than some 
        frozen feathers. <br>

      <p align="left">This past weekend, the team took a road trip, meeting up 
        against both nationally top-ranked Middlebury and NESCAC rival Williams 
        (whom the Bears had never beaten on the road). The women skated to a tough 
        overtime loss to Middlebury, and at last proved victorious over Williams. 
        Sadie Wieschhoff '04 was encouraged by the win, &quot;We finally broke 
        the curse and won at Williams.&quot; Of the 2-1 loss against Middlebury, 
        Kirsten Larsen '04 pointed out, &quot;We battled until overtime.&quot; 
        The team may be slightly disappointed, but again Wieschhoff notes the 
        fact that, &quot;Back-to-back games on the road are rough.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin overcame a 1-0 deficit in the second period against 
        Middlebury when Jess Burke '04 scored at 17:32. After an evenly matched 
        third period, Middlebury won the game in overtime on a breakaway goal. 
        The next day in Williamstown, Massachusetts. the Bears rebounded from 
        the loss by defeating Williams 4-3. Scoring for Bowdoin were Burke, Gillian 
        McDonald '04, Shelly Chessie '03, and Marissa O'Neil '05. Emily McKissock 
        '03 continued with the same stellar play she has demonstrated all season 
        making 28 saves between the pipes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rounding out the Bears season was a final showdown with 
        Colby in Waterville. After a long weekend, this Tuesday (the 20th) the 
        Bears skated in with perhaps a little less fire against the Mules than 
        they displayed last Tuesday, February 12, during their first match-up 
        with Colby this season. Besides the jaw-dropping six goals scored between 
        Chessie and O'Neil, Jen Crane, Ba Lanoue, Larsen, and Katie Duglin all 
        hit the back of the net. <br>
        Always the entertainers, this team provided not only a large quantity 
        of goals, but also high quality ones. Larsen began the third period scoring 
        a beautiful one-timer that blew by the Colby net-minder. Of Larsen's goal, 
        Cathie Quinlan said with a little shimmah-shimmah dance, &quot;That girl's 
        THE SH*T. I only wish I could shoot the puck like her.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not to be outdone by a fellow defenseman, later in the third, 
        first-year Katie Duglin took the puck starting from behind her own goal 
        line. She traversed end-to-end, weaving in and out of the entire Colby 
        team to finish with a spectacular diving one-handed, backhand goal in 
        true Bobby Orr fashion. <br>
        In the most recent game against Colby, the Bears faltered a bit and the 
        game resulted in a 2-2 tie. Chessie said of the game, &quot;We needed 
        to play well and we didn't.&quot; While Bowdoin out shot the Mules 37-20, 
        they just couldn't seem to find the back of the net. Kirsti Anderson and 
        Jess Burke scored the only goals for the Bears and the reliable McKissock 
        ended with 18 saves in the net. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This Saturday afternoon the Polar Bears will take on Amherst 
        in Dayton arena for the first round of the NESCAC tournament. Jess Burke 
        claims, &quot;We are psyched about this weekend.&quot; and Chessie adds, 
        &quot;Post-season play is intense&#133;we have a lot to prove. We need 
        to be focused for this weekend and play how we are capable. We made it 
        this far for a reason and we need to realize that and be proud of it.&quot; 
        Indeed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These Bears have something to prove and you should be there 
        to witness it. Watch the fur fly and ignore the feathers. Believe it, 
        and let this team be your hero&#133;they can take your breath away. </p>
