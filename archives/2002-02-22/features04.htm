        for the faculty discussion on globalization last Monday, but the students

        and bad of the expanding world economy.<br>

      <p align="left">Two economics professors, Michael Jones and Kerry Pannell, 
        shared the dais with government professors Jonathan Weiler and Professor 
        Emeritus John Rensenbrink, and Professor Nathaniel Wheelwright of biology.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The debate, introduced by Molly Farneth of Bowdoin Students 
        for Democratic Socialism, the sponsor of the talk, highlighted many of 
        the most frequently cited environmental, labor and jurisdictional concerns, 
        as well as some intriguing new arguments and a surprising defense of globalization.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jones offered a dictionary definition of globalization, 
        &quot;becoming a part of the world.&quot; He contrasted it with isolationism 
        and noted that it can be measured by the percent of a country's transactions 
        that are international, rather than domestic. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He suggested &quot;there is nothing bad about globalization, 
        per se.&quot; In fact, he said, opening up free trade between countries 
        means a bigger economic pie with potentially larger slices for everyone. 
        However, &quot;without adequate national and international safeguards,&quot; 
        he added, it can pose significant problems. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jones concluded that we should be careful not to see globalization 
        as either &quot;a whipping boy [or] a magic elixir.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pannell, the other Economics professor, highlighted the 
        importance of comparative advantage in terms of international trade. She 
        noted the conflict between strengthening international environmental standards 
        and the comparative advantage developing countries have in luring international 
        corporations with cheaper production costs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pannell said that immigration policies around the world 
        could be liberalized to allow people to move where capital is. She also 
        suggested that the negative influence of corporate activities in developing 
        countries has been exaggerated. &quot;External corporate influence can 
        be a good thing in countries that are poor world citizens,&quot; such 
        as Indonesia.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Just when everyone seemed to agree, Rensenbrink, the government 
        professor emeritus and a leader in the Green Party, spiced up the debate 
        by pointing out some dangerous forces as well as two positives in the 
        debate over globalization.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rensenbrink argued that the power of international corporations 
        means non-governmental organizations such as the World Trade Organization 
        and 24,000 others, work mostly for the economic benefit of major companies, 
        when they could be &quot;fighting for workers' rights, environmental protection 
        and peace.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He said the WTO meeting doors need to open up so people 
        know how their important decisions are made. We should create a World 
        Environmental Organization, he said, as a counterpart to the WTO. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He argued that direct action and the growth of green parties 
        (currently 81 worldwide) are shaping up as major forces to oppose the 
        negative byproducts of globalization, but he said their power is &quot;no 
        match for the multi-national corporations.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The debt of developing nations is a major problem, Resenbrink 
        said. With a 34 percent increase in 10 years, the developing world now 
        owes 2.5 trillion to the developed countries. He said taxing international 
        trade more heavily could help stop &quot;the net transfer of wealth from 
        poor to rich countries&quot; that is crippling the less developed nations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We need a more engaging human vision,&quot; Resenbrink 
        said, &quot;that puts people first . . . and moves toward an ecological 
        economics.&quot; He said the cultural and spiritual sides of the issue 
        should not be ignored.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Weiler, the other Government professor, urged the audience 
        to think of globalization in political terms. &quot;It's a mistake,&quot; 
        he said, to understand non-governmental organizations and agreements such 
        as the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as &quot;economics 
        divorced from politics.&quot; In addition, &quot;corporations,&quot; he 
        said, &quot;are themselves political entities.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He also raised concerns about the operation of these organizations. 
        &quot;A characteristic problem of NGOs,&quot; said Weiler, &quot;is their 
        level of secrecy. This makes it extremely difficult to determine the motives 
        behind their decisions.&quot; <br>
        He also stressed that the powerful multi-national corporations have gained 
        concessions in the structure of NAFTA and other international agreements. 
        These concessions heavily favor corporate interests, Weiler said, at the 
        expense of labor and the environment. He pointed to Chapter 11 of NAFTA. 
        The chapter makes great pains to give corporations many rights to sue 
        to protect their bottom line, &quot;while labor union rights to organize 
        are regularly violated.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Finally, Wheelwright, the Biology professor, raised concerns 
        about the tremendous decrease in the world's biodiversity. He urged a 
        third perspective-beyond politics and economics-from which to consider 
        globalization: ecology.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Acadia, Wheelwright said, 25 percent of the species are 
        non-native weeds. &quot;We are losing a tremendous amount of biodiversity,&quot; 
        he warned, &quot;and the process is accelerating.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The loss, said Wheelwright, is having a disproportionate 
        impact on small countries. In Costa Rica alone, he added, &quot;Deforestation 
        has accelerated in the last couple decades&quot; so that the country is 
        now 75 percent deforested.<br>
        Globalization has encouraged people in developing countries to harvest 
        natural resources in an unsustainable way, he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a lengthy question and answer session after the debate, 
        Jones, the Economics professor, added that he agreed with Rensenbrink 
        that the idea for a new &quot;World Environmental Organization,&quot; 
        or WEO, could be an important addition to the WTO. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A student asked whether the U.S. and international organizations 
        the U.S. supports, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary 
        Fund (IMF), should forgive the debt of developing nations. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both Pannell and Jones raised concerns about forgiving debt. 
        Pannell worried that money meant to support the economic development of 
        a country could instead be seized by powerful economic elites. However, 
        she did say she supported forgiving debt of the poorest nations in the 
        world, which are highly unlikely to be able to repay what they owe.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One question brought the debate from abstraction to reality. 
        In the wake of production transfers at Dexter, the Maine shoe manufacturer, 
        from New England to China, the questioner asked how the loss of five hundred 
        Maine jobs could be a positive benefit of globalization.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jones cautioned against thinking about the issue &quot;as 
        one country gains, another loses.&quot; In fact, he replied, both gain 
        from trading with one another in the long run. He suggested more significant 
        compensation and job re-training mechanisms could help address the local 
        cuts. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rensenbrink, on the other hand, said the layoffs were an 
        example of when &quot;comparative advantage doesn't work.&quot; He said 
        that &quot;economics have taken over as if abstract concerns are more 
        important than family, culture and community. Five hundred people who 
        just lost their jobs is a real, real issue,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Students for Democratic Socialism, the debate sponsors, 
        are planning two more events in the globalization series. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next Wednesday, the group is showing &quot;Deadly Embrace,&quot; 
        a film about Nicaragua, the World Bank and the International Monetary 
        Fund. The event, including a discussion after the film, will take place 
        Wednesday, February 27, at 7:30 P.M. in the West Hubbard Conference Room.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sally Pachulski, a representative of Jubilee USA, an organization 
        advocating foreign debt relief, will give a lecture at a date and time 
        to be determined.<br>
