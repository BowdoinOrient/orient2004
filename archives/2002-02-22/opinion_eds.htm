      <p align="left"><i>It's been a late night. You've been working on your orgo 
        lab report for six hours. It's 3:00 a.m., and you're just now leaving 
        the Hatch computer lab. You can't wait to get home to your soft, warm 
        bed in your cozy, closet-like single in Chamberlain.<br>
        </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>As you're walking past the Polar Bear, you hear footsteps 
        behind you. You think, &quot;Oh, a fellow late-nighter is on his or her 
        way home.&quot; But there's something odd about these footsteps. They 
        seem to be getting closer. You quicken your pace. The footsteps do likewise. 
        You turn toward the chapel. The footsteps follow you. You begin to move 
        even faster. The footsteps match yours. You are forced to come to the 
        conclusion that you are being followed-and not by a fellow late-nighter.<br>
        </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>You turn around and see the figure quickly approaching 
        you. You decide to make a break for Hyde. You start running. You reach 
        into your pocket for your ID. You have just enough time to pull out your 
        card, open the door, dash into Hyde, and pull the door closed behind you.<br>
        </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>With your left hand on the door handle, you hold the 
        card in your other hand and thrust it toward the card reader. You yank 
        on the door, but nothing happens. The door doesn't open. You look in horror 
        as you see that the card reader still shows a red light.<br>
        </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>And then it hits you. Your card won't work on the doors 
        of any dorm but your own after 2:00 a.m. <br>
        </i></p>
      <p align="left"><i>You turn around and try to scream, but it's too late.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The little-known fact that Bowdoin students cannot use their 
        ID cards to access dorms other than their own after 2:00 a.m. is not only 
        inconvenient, but also extremely dangerous. And the worst part of it is 
        that there is absolutely no reason why such a rule should even be in place. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And yet there are many, many reasons to allow students 24-hour 
        access into all of the dorms. Besides the obvious issue of safety, a number 
        of dorms do not have laundry space. It is not at all uncommon for students 
        to start their laundry very late at night, and it is often impossible 
        to get it all done before 2:00 a.m. There is no reason students should 
        be denied their clean underwear just because it's after 2:00 a.m.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Also, after 2:00 a.m., a friend cannot let a fellow student 
        into his or her dorm if that friend does not live in the same dorm as 
        the student. In this case, Security must be called to let the student 
        in. This creates not only a needless burden on Security, but also forces 
        a student to wait outside, which is in no way safe.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Why the College even has a 2:00 a.m. rule is unclear, but 
        it seems to hearken back to the days when girls were not allowed in dorms 
        at all after 8:00 p.m. It is an outdated, ridiculous, dangerous rule that 
        the College should do away with immediately before a real tragedy occurs.<br>
