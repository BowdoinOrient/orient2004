        A grading story: 5 affairs</font><br>
        <font size="2">FE VIVAS<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the College debates the future of the grading system, 
        whether that future includes controversial pluses and minuses or not, 
        some have sought guidance from the system's long history.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The earliest grading system, though seemingly enigmatic 
        to the modern day observer, appears to have been constructed with great 
        attention to precision. Students received weekly evaluations throughout 
        the trimesters based on their attendance and performance at recitation, 
        prayers, public worship, lectures, and examinations. The evaluation was 
        in the form of a numerical rank.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ranks for each week of the trimester were then formulaically 
        combined to yield a term rank, which was also numerical and based on a 
        ranking system. Evaluation of student performance was divided into separate 
        categories and then totaled to display a cumulative numerical assessment.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This system made it rather easy for a student to receive 
        a lower mark despite academic proficiency. Ian Graham, special collections 
        and Archives Assistant, commented that, &quot;It has been said that [under 
        this grading system] Hawthorne's grade was docked due to poor attendance 
        at morning prayers and weekly Masses.&quot; Grade inflation was minimal 
        under the first grading system of the College.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This points system evolved into the A, B, C, D, and F-system 
        firmly in place during the first half of the 20th century. The letter 
        grades corresponded to a ten-point numerical grade range that many professors 
        utilize today. An A signified a grade between a 90 and a 100, a B between 
        an 80 and an 89, and so on. A failing grade, an F, denoted a numerical 
        grade below a 60. These grades, contrary to the points system, were largely 
        based on a percentage evaluation. Course work was assessed on the basis 
        of percentage correct and/or percentage rank within the course. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1954, the grading system switched over to the plus/minus 
        system which may find its way back to the College after an absence of 
        over 30 years. This plus/minus system is a more detailed derivative of 
        the A, B, C, D, F-system. An A+ denoted a grade between a 97 and a 100, 
        an A between a 94 and a 96, and an A- between a 90 and a 93, a B+ between 
        an 87 and an 89, a B between an 84 and an 86, a B- between an 80 and an 
        83, and so on. A failing grade under this system was any grade below a 
        60.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1967, the College switched over to an unusual 4 point 
        system which Professor Franklin Burroughs of the English department claims 
        was instituted, &quot;to try to minimize the importance of grades, insofar 
        as possible.&quot; The system was constructed using grades of HH (high 
        honors), H (honors), P (pass), and F (fail). A HH signify excellent work, 
        an H indicated good work, a P denoted satisfactory work, and an F was 
        reserved for students who were failing.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">An alternate reason behind the switch to this system of 
        grades was in response to the Vietnam War. Christine Cote, director of 
        institutional research and registrar said, &quot;Students were more likely 
        to be drafted if their grades were low. This system made it difficult 
        for grade point averages to be calculated for Bowdoin students and drafting 
        less likely.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Professor Burroughs explained, the deficiencies of this 
        system were twofold: &quot;The system lacked a middle term...it recognized 
        degrees of excellence [HH, H] but not of inadequacy-it had no equivalent 
        for the D. It was also difficult for graduate and professional schools 
        to interpret.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a professor throughout the life of this system, Burroughs 
        believed that these drawbacks were real but not sufficient to encourage 
        a change in the system. This 4-point system remained in place until 1990.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The 1990s ushered in the reintroduction of Bowdoin faculty 
        and students to the A, B, C, D, F-system, but this time with more subjective 
        meanings behind each letter grade. As outlined on the back of each transcript, 
        an A signifies that &quot;the student has mastered the material of the 
        course and has demonstrated exceptional critical skills and originality.&quot; 
        A B designates that &quot;the student has demonstrated a thorough and 
        above average understanding of the material of the course. &quot;A C means, 
        &quot;The student has demonstrated a thorough and satisfactory understanding 
        of the material of the course. &quot;A D assumes that &quot;the student 
        has demonstrated a marginally satisfactory understanding of the basic 
        material of the course.&quot; An F is reserved for &quot;students who 
        have not demonstrated a satisfactory understanding of the basic material 
        of the course.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now that the College's grading system has come under fire, 
        Professor Burroughs's words ring with significance, &quot;Changing the 
        grading system serves only to increase our institutional preoccupation 
        with, and anxiety over, grades. That preoccupation and that anxiety seem 
        to get higher every year, and they work against our institutional purpose. 
        They focus attention on the student's transcript, not on the student's 
        education.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In regards to the future of the college grading system, 
        almost 70% of the student body voted to uphold the current system while 
        80% of the faculty voted to transfer to the plus/minus grading system. 
        The system that has been in place since 1990 may well be ousted in future 
        years.<br>
