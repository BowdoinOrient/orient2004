        <font size="2">ALEX DUNCAN</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>In recent days and weeks, it seems as if President Bush's &quot;axis 
        of evil&quot; has become the hot new phrase for the government (and subsequently 
        in the media as well), taking over after months of &quot;bin Laden,&quot; 
        &quot;Taliban,&quot; and &quot;al Qaeda.&quot; In many respects, that's 
        a good thing. However, at the same time, I think that we need to tone 
        down our rhetoric a bit and adopt a less inflammatory tone as we begin 
        to address problems outside of Afghanistan. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sure, &quot;axis of evil&quot; is direct and clear (and sounds really 
        good in a speech), but it only further polarizes the current split between 
        those who are America-friendly and those who are not. If we're really 
        going to solve the problem of terrorism in the future, we're going to 
        have to stop fueling the fires of hatred toward the United States. Labeling 
        other countries and people as &quot;evil&quot; is no way to start. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Clearly, threats to the U.S. still exist and must be eliminated. This 
        can't be accomplished without the use of force, and we should utilize 
        our military when necessary, whether it's in Iraq, Somalia, or elsewhere. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time however, we need to ensure that we do so in a specific, 
        calculated, and most importantly, emotionless manner. Our military is 
        a serious threat to any country in the world, and as such, when we make 
        it known that we consider a country or group to be a menace, we need not 
        tack on the stigma of some higher purpose, a &quot;good vs. evil&quot; 
        clich&eacute;. Doing so only gives people a reason to fight with motivation 
        beyond personal safety. It gives them a cause to believe in, not only 
        during the course of hostilities, but in the future as well. When we label 
        others as evil, we immediately cast the same pall on ourselves, in their 
        eyes. In this battle against terrorism, where perceptions mean everything, 
        that's a mistake.</p>
      <p> The root cause of terrorism is misperception. Some perceive the United 
        States as an aggressive, imperial superpower, with no regard for the customs 
        or interests of others. We Americans, of course, would certainly disagree. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, our actual motives are, in fact, unimportant. The way in which 
        others identify us is what shapes their opinions, not what we really are, 
        or what we believe ourselves to be. Therefore, when our leaders refer 
        to other states and citizens as &quot;evil,&quot; they are not helping 
        to change the common perception of the United States as a superpower at 
        odds with all others.<br>
        &quot;Evil&quot; is far too general a word to publicly indict an individual 
        or country for its actions. Moreover, it implies a religious or biblical 
        type of negativity, the very sort that inspires terrorists such as those 
        in al Qaeda. Jihad is derived from such religious motivation. We need 
        to separate ourselves from this concept. If we reinforce the idea of a 
        religious or moral split between western and other nations, terrorism's 
        proliferation will continue, and we will be partially responsible.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, I understand that there are strategic reasons for the government's 
        heavy language. If we make a commotion about a country's practices and 
        then threaten to invade, maybe we'll intimidate them into submitting to 
        our desires. Or, if we talk tough about certain leaders, perhaps that 
        nation's people will rise up and take those individuals out of power before 
        we have to. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, there are better and more effective ways to go about such psychological 
        warfare, as opposed to general and broad-based threats. Present these 
        countries and individuals with specific requirements, and suggest the 
        repercussions of failing to act (namely, the unerring efficacy of the 
        U.S. military). Such an approach is clear and cold, with little room for 
        manipulation for the purposes of motivation. There's no religious context 
        and no larger issue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the wake of what happened in September, there's a lot of support for 
        action overseas with (understandably) plenty of emotion behind it. Thus 
        far our government-in particular President Bush and his Cabinet-has done 
        a great job of utilizing our military in conjunction with support at home. 
        However, let's remember that there's another war that we're fighting on 
        top of the military one: a war of perception. Win both the military and 
        image fights, and we will be successful. Conversely, win the military 
        war now, but lose the war of perception, and we'll have to fight this 
        battle all over again down the road. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So, as we employ our military might where it's needed, let's also tone 
        down our talk and cut words like &quot;evil&quot; out of our international 
        vocabulary. That way we'll win on both fronts, and for good.</p>
