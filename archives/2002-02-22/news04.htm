      <p align="left"> A Bowdoin student is suing the College in federal court 
        for violating his civil rights and breaching a contract in a 1999 Judicial 
        Board case which led to his expulsion.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The student, George C. W. Goodman '00, names as defendants 
        the President and trustees of the College, as well as President Emeritus 
        Robert Edwards, Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley, Director of Residential 
        Life Robert Graves, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Mya Mangawang, and 
        former Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Karen Tilbor. The trial is being 
        conducted before a jury in the Portland courtroom of U.S. District Judge 
        Gene Carter.<br>

      <p align="left">Edwards, Tilbor, Mangawang and Bradley could not be reached 
        for comment. Graves declined to discuss the case. James Kilbreth and Jackie 
        Rider, of Verrill &amp; Dana, a Portland law firm, are representing Bowdoin. 
        Goodman is represented by Mark Furey, a Portland lawyer, and Collette 
        Goodman, his mother, also a lawyer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In March 1999, Goodman threw a snowball at the college shuttle 
        as it drove down College Street. He and the shuttle driver, Namsoo Lee 
        '01, began fighting, and Lee was treated that night at Parkview Hospital 
        for a broken nose.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On April 13, 1999, the J-Board held a hearing, concluded 
        that Goodman alone was at fault, and recommended that he be &quot;immediately 
        and permanently expelled&quot;, said Scott Hood, Bowdoin's director of 
        communications. Dean Bradley, after receiving the J-Board's recommendation, 
        passed on to the Administrative Committee a recommendation that Goodman 
        be indefinitely suspended, with the opportunity to reapply to Bowdoin 
        later. The Administrative Committee did expel Goodman, but allowed him 
        to complete the spring semester.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodman reapplied to Bowdoin for admission in the fall of 
        2001, two years after his expulsion, and was accepted. He enrolled in 
        classes last semester, and is currently on a leave of absence from the 
        College. Lee returned to Bowdoin this semester after serving two years 
        in the South <br>
        Korean military. He declined to be interviewed for this article.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodman's original suit, filed in May 2000, claimed several 
        different grievances. Two of these alleged that Bowdoin had violated his 
        civil rights at the J-Board hearing by unfairly relying on race-based 
        explanations of his behavior. Goodman's complaint noted that Lee is &quot;Asian 
        and a citizen of Korea,&quot; and Goodman claimed the J-Board discriminated 
        against him because he is white. The suit being heard this week contains 
        an additional civil rights complaint, based on a Maine human rights law.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In court yesterday, Carter granted a motion by Kilbreth, 
        Bowdoin's counsel, to dismiss the three civil rights charges. He told 
        the court that no jury could find &quot;direct or circumstantial evidence 
        of racial animus&quot; on Bowdoin's part.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Still before the jury are three other claims. Goodman contends 
        that the defendants breached a contract between Goodman and Bowdoin as 
        established in the Student Handbook, the Social Code and the Academic 
        Code. In addition, a 'tortious interference' claim asserts that the defendants 
        arbitrarily altered official Judicial Board procedures. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodman also accuses the College of negligence in training 
        its shuttle drivers, including Lee. Today, Carter dismissed claims of 
        tortious interference on the part of Edwards, Graves, and Tilbor, and 
        left for the jury's consideration the negligence claim, the breach of 
        contract claim, and tortious interference claims against Bradley and Mangawang.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's lawyers moved to dismiss all of Goodman's complaints 
        at a hearing in March 2001. Carter dismissed two of the counts at that 
        hearing, both of them involving contract law, and allowed the civil rights 
        claims to proceed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kilbreth said he expects the jury to reach a verdict today.<br>
