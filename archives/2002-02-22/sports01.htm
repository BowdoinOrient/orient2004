      <p>Most teams don't want to lose. However, men's hockey head coach Terry 
        Meagher asserted that last weekend's losses were, in fact, exactly what 
        his team needed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;[Hamilton and Colby] were very good tests; that's what you want-games 
        like that in your last weeks of the regular season,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>

      <p>The Bears split the last pair of games in the 2001-2002 season, and head 
        into the playoffs 17-3-3 overall. Their 14-2-3 league record placed them 
        at second in NESCAC season-end standings.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After a rough loss to Colby on February 9, the men turned their practice 
        focus inward, realigning themselves as a team and readying for Amherst 
        and Hamilton. The focus worked last Friday, when the Bears squeezed eight 
        goals out of the Jeffs for an 8-2 victory. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We rebounded really well after the Colby game. We paid attention 
        to fundamentals, and we were much more disciplined as a team,&quot; Meagher 
        said. &quot;We put things in perspective: maybe [against Colby] we hadn't 
        played the game we were capable of, but that was the first time in the 
        context of season, and we had been doing a lot of good things too.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>At 11:28 in the first period, Albert Mayer '03 put the first Bowdoin 
        goal on the board, and it wouldn't be long before a pair of Sean Starke 
        '03 goals put the Bears up 3-0 going into the second.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mike Carosi's pass found fellow senior Bill Busch out front, who backhanded 
        the puck past Jeff goaltender Justin Jagher. Andy McNerney '02 and Chad 
        Hart '03 both scored within the 13th minute to give the Bears the biggest 
        margin they'd see: 6-0.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Jeffs answered at the end of the second period, as Dave Moore beat 
        sophomore goaltender Mike Healey for a 6-1 score. The third frame saw 
        another Amherst goal, from Scott Aldrich at 12:11, but goals from sophomores 
        Marty Brisebois and Mike Stevens capped the 8-2 Bowdoin win.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Healey turned away 21 in the game, while Jagher saved 29 Bear attempts. 
        &quot;Michael made some key saves,&quot; Meagher said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When Hamilton visited Dayton last Saturday, the outcome was a different 
        story. The Bears fought their way through a back-and-forth game that needed 
        overtime for Continental Kevin Audit to break a 3-3 tie.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Juniors Kevin Castonguay, Adam Mantin, and Ryan Seymour netted goals 
        for the Bears, but they wound up on the losing end of a 3-4 score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;[Hamilton is] a very good team,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;It was 
        just a good hockey game,&quot; he said. &quot;We were playing very well 
        defensively; both teams were technically very sound.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We had some fundamental breakdowns that should never happen in 
        a game,&quot; he added. &quot;We let it go too far. That was the tough 
        part of the weekend-it was like a playoff game, and we learned that breakdowns 
        are going to cost you.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears face off with Amherst for the second time in two weeks tomorrow 
        in the first round of NESCAC playoffs. &quot;We've had the whole week 
        to prepare for an opponent we've just seen; that's fresh in our minds,&quot; 
        Meagher said. &quot;The challenge is to find that balance, to maintain 
        what we do well and not overanalyze.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite his team's 8-2 margin over the Jeffs last Saturday, Meagher isn't 
        overconfident. &quot;I go into every game with the feeling that if we 
        play our game, we'll be competitive. It comes down to execution and mental 
        preparedness and good goaltending.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He has a lot of faith that his men's performance over the course of the 
        season will serve them well in the playoffs and beyond. &quot;I'm very 
        proud of this team,&quot; he said. &quot;They've handled themselves on 
        trips, been good citizens on campus...<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I'm a firm believer that your team is a product of your leadership,&quot; 
        he added. &quot;The senior class's leadership is so important; they do 
        a great job of keeping the team on an even keel.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears can count on a reliable goaltender as their last line of defense 
        in playoff games, too. According to Meagher, Healey's play in net has 
        been steady, even in the face of injury. &quot;He went into the first 
        game injured and played through it, then took a hard hit in the Hamilton 
        game,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>First year Nathan Riddle, hit in the Colby game on February 12, is out 
        for the remainder of the year with knee problems. &quot;It's a big loss; 
        he quiets the game so well,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;He's very important 
        to us, and it's hard because it was a joy for a lot of people to watch 
        him play.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>While past games and performances are a major consideration in postseason 
        preparation, tomorrow is a fresh start for the Bears.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's a new season-nothing that happened prior matters anymore,&quot; 
        Meagher said.</p>
