      <p align="left">By July 1, 1863 the Battle of Gettysburg had started (For 
        further information please refer to the Chamberlain and Howard Series) 
        but Tom Hyde, serving on the staff of Sixth Corps commander, General John 
        Sedgwick, was at Manchester, Maryland, 35 miles away. When battle was 
        inaugurated, however, the Union army's new commander, General Meade quickly 
        sent an officer from his staff to hurry the Sixth Corps up to the front. 
        Sedgwick reacted quickly, and arrived with his men in the afternoon of 
        July 2.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Sixth Corps was not heavily engaged at Gettysburg. It 
        missed the first day's fighting entirely and was in reserve capacity for 
        most of the remaining battle. This small fact, however, did not stop Tom 
        Hyde from writing of the Battle in great detail.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde wrote that, on the 30th of June, he was sent to Taneytown, 
        Maryland to find army headquarters and request instructions. He claims 
        that he witnessed Meade's council of war with a number of high-ranking 
        subordinates. Meade, Hyde recollects, said simply, &quot;To-morrow, gentlemen, 
        we fight the decisive battle of the war.&quot; On July 2, as Sedgwick's 
        men arrived on the field, Hyde says he rode up to Little Round Top and 
        watched as Confederate troops fell back. Exhausted by the long march, 
        that night he and the men &quot;were soon sleeping the dreamless sleep 
        of youth and fatigue.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On July 3, Hyde claims to have been all over the field. 
        In the morning, he was ordered to place a brigade of the Sixth Corps at 
        the extreme right of the Union line. Afterwards, returning to the area 
        of Little Round Top (on the opposite side of the battlefield), Hyde writes 
        that he saw Union cavalry General Farnsworth's disastrous attack before 
        the bombardment leading up to Pickett's Charge began. After Hyde rode 
        down the line after that infamous charge, he remembered, &quot;I saw General 
        Armistead, the Confederate leader, dying, and near him Cushing of the 
        regular artillery, who had fired his last gun with one hand, though partly 
        cut in two, holding his body together with the other. Then I tried to 
        ride over the field, but could not, for the dead and wounded lay too thick 
        to guide a horse through them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The carnage of the battlefield that Hyde saw, I do not doubt. 
        Any Civil War battlefield had the same images that are too horrible for 
        us to imagine. There is, however, a cause to doubt all that Hyde claims 
        to have accomplished on that field. Without questioning Hyde's courage, 
        for he proved himself many times, I must say that the Mainer greatly exaggerated 
        his story.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To start off, Hyde got his dates confused. The Battle had 
        not started on June 30, and General Meade could not have had a council 
        of war with his subordinates at Taneytown, for many of the men that Hyde 
        named at the council were already in the vicinity of Gettysburg. Farnsworth's 
        Charge, in truth, occurred after Pickett's Charge and Hyde's recollections 
        that he saw the cavalry battle on the third day must be questioned as 
        well, for the fighting was quite far off from the main battlefield. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In his memoirs of the War, Hyde must have simply been trying 
        to show that he was witness to that battle, by which the Civil War is 
        most remembered. The truth about his whereabouts at Gettysburg will probably 
        never be told in full. All we may be sure of is that he was with the Sixth 
        Corps and was also with its commander when Meade followed Lee to the Potomac 
        River and watched him escape into Virginia later that July.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The fighting at Gettysburg ended on July 3, 1863. One day 
        later, Independence Day, the river town of Vicksburg, on the Mississippi, 
        surrendered to Ulysses Grant. It was also on this day that a number of 
        unhappy Democrats staged a rally and invited Franklin Pierce to speak. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce, Bowdoin class of 1824, after leaving the White House, 
        had watched from afar as the Union started fighting itself. When the Emancipation 
        Proclamation was issued in 1862 Pierce spoke out against it. He did not 
        think it was constitutional but his objection had more to do with his 
        deep prejudice for African-Americans. When July 4, 1863, the nation's 
        eighty-seventh birthday dawned, Pierce spoke out again. He attacked Lincoln, 
        denounced the Emancipation Proclamation and even assaulted the basis for 
        the War. It was very bad timing to say the least. The two major Union 
        victories had boosted patriotism all over the North. Pierce's words violently 
        backfired, and he would never recover what little reputation he still 
        had.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the summer of 1863, the Union began to see that victory 
        over the Confederacy was possible. Tom Hyde had been at Gettysburg and 
        would spend the rest of the year hunting the elusive rebel, John Mosby. 
        Failing in that, he would participate in the Mine Run Campaign, which 
        again failed to yield any substantial results.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile there were still other battles to be fought on 
        different battlefields in 1863. One of them would be in the United States 
        Senate, to which William Pitt Fessenden had returned.<br>
