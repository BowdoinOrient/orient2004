      <p align="left"><font size="5">Politics and political language</font><br>
        <font size="2">PATRICK ROCKEFELLER</font></p>
      <p>If you want to witness one of the greatest differences between the Clinton 
        administration and the Bush administration, look at the rhetoric. While 
        Bill quibbles for a definition of &quot;is,&quot; Bush unapologetically 
        calls 'em as he sees 'em. Forget the sex scandals, this is the moral clarity 
        that our country has been lacking.<br>
      </p>
      <p>George Orwell wrote an essay in 1946 that is still pertinent today. In 
        &quot;Politics and the English Language,&quot; he contends, &quot;In our 
        time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.&quot; 
        Politicians use convoluted terms and unspecific words as a means of disguising 
        what they don't want to say publicly. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For example, &quot;The perilous deconstruction of the nation's finances 
        coupled with economic obligations to the proletariat mandates the forced 
        enhancement of state revenue.&quot; This is a convoluted way of saying, 
        &quot;We're going to jack up your taxes because we want to spend more 
        money than we have.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Madeline Albright (&quot;Half-bright&quot; in some circles&#133;), the 
        Secretary of State for the second half of the Clinton years, is a prime 
        example of the feel-good word games that characterized that administration. 
        Wary that the term &quot;rogue nation&quot; was too judgmental, she lobbied 
        to have it formally changed to the much more forgiving &quot;state of 
        concern.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Satellite images picked up Saddam Hussein laughing hysterically in one 
        of his palaces as he continued to gas the Kurds in the north. While Clinton 
        was &quot;feeling our pain,&quot; Hussein was, as Orwell called it, working 
        on the &quot;elimination of unreliable elements&quot; (killing opposition). 
        Albright confirmed that she was in fact concerned.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Orwell believed that plain, clear expression was the only way for a government 
        to communicate to its people. So, while Bush certainly botches words from 
        time to time, giving some a chuckle and causing his press secretary to 
        cringe, we know what he means and, most importantly, what he stands for. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Which brings us to his most recent and most famous phrase, so far-the 
        &quot;axis of evil.&quot; Reminiscent of the Great Communicator's (Reagan) 
        &quot;Evil Empire,&quot; the term is important for its clarity and direct 
        approach.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I would consider some criticisms of the phrase valid, specifically the 
        'axis' part. Iraq, Iran, and North Korea are not an axis in the same way 
        as the Axis powers of WWII were, and they don't have much allegiance to 
        one another.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But that's not really the point. The point is that Bush, although surely 
        cognizant of differences between those states, is unwilling to accept 
        any nation's support or sponsorship of terrorism and international instability.<br>
        Even if these countries aren't an axis in the traditional sense, a very 
        solid case can still be made for labeling them &quot;evil.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>North Korea is the last Stalinist state on earth. Kim Jong Il is a force 
        for repression, making China look like a model of human rights. Furthermore, 
        the nation shares ballistic missile technology, increasing the ability 
        of rogue nations to kill us infidels.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Iran is an interesting case-a very young population, ripe for revolution. 
        However, those in power continue to adhere to a strict fundamentalist 
        religious doctrine a la Taliban. Autocratic theocracies that sell arms 
        to Palestinian terrorist groups generally don't yield to reasoned discourse. 
        Any effort we can make to destabilize their government is better for the 
        people of Iran as it will in the end yield greater freedom.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Iraq needs no introduction. If you need someone to explain to you why 
        the United States should topple his regime, you are probably too sophisticated 
        (or European) for decent company.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The French, and many of our European 'allies,' scoff at Bush's roughshod 
        language. They think it is Bush the cowboy acting tough and meddling in 
        affairs best left for the United Nations and European intellectuals to 
        'condemn' and then ignore. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But, just as sure as the French in WWII surrendered to the Nazi's in 
        a mere six weeks, Bush's language will set the tone for our foreign policy.<br>
      </p>
      <p>His speech is clear and direct. Bush said that we would clean the terrorists 
        and those that support them out of Afghanistan, and we did, with minimal 
        civilian and American casualties. He said that America will continue to 
        fight terrorism across the world, and we will. The smart money is on the 
        end of Hussein in late June.</p>
