      <p align="left"><font size="5">Intellectual discussion in Bowdoin's... <i>baths</i>?</font><br>
        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></p>
      <p align="left"> There has been a great deal of intelligent and meaningful 
        discussion recently about the lack of intelligent and meaningful discussion 
        at Bowdoin. I agree with the claim that Bowdoin students, crippled by 
        an invisible and omnipresent bubble, don't engage in enough meaningful 
        discourse about serious topics. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Just the other day I sat down with a group of students from Appleton 
        and attempted to start a conversation about the ins and outs of the figure 
        skating scandal. I was met with blank stares. I moved on to a table of 
        eight students eating in complete silence. I greeted them with a casual, 
        &quot;How about that new Office of Strategic Influence?&quot; Nothing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Having established that there is a serious deficiency in meaningful discourse 
        among students at Bowdoin, I set out to solve the problem, and I think 
        I have. The answer can be summed up with two words: &quot;bath&quot; and 
        &quot;house.&quot; I am proposing that the old pool building next to Smith 
        Union be turned into a Greek-style bathhouse equipped with saunas, hot 
        tubs, and possibly tanning booths. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This makes sense on a lot of levels. First, who really wants to talk 
        to anyone (or do anything, if you want to get technical), during the winter 
        in Maine? Cold dark days have a serious effect on what I like to call 
        &quot;The Will to Live.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>This theory is somewhat similar to Nietzsche's famous &quot;Will to Power,&quot; 
        but rather then focusing on an individual's ability to conquer the artificial 
        construct that is Christian morality and seeking truth, &quot;The Will 
        to Live&quot; is concerned with an individual's desire to wake up each 
        morning and engage in basic functional activities, like showering, getting 
        dressed, going to class, eating, etc. The &quot;Will to Live&quot; describes 
        an individual's ability and desire to &quot;go on living.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>My will to live, and I imagine I am not alone in this regard, is seriously 
        affected by the winter months' intense darkness and savage cold. It seems 
        foolish and inefficient to allow the Curtis Pool building to sit unoccupied 
        while students across our campus are crippled by the deterioration of 
        their respective wills to live.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I spent a semester in Scandinavia, a place where winter's savagery and 
        darkness surpass those of Maine. It is in Scandinavia that saunas have 
        enjoyed widespread popularity, and I am willing to assert that this is 
        no accident. Scandinavians have a knack for figuring things out-they enjoy 
        health care, enlightened social policy, and gorgeous women. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is time to take a cue from the Nordic people and push ahead with the 
        construction of a Greek-style bathhouse. Hot tubs, saunas, and tanning 
        booths, all Scandinavian staples, would clearly serve to increase the 
        quality of life for Bowdoin students during the winter months, which run 
        from mid-November to mid-April. The season's domination of both semesters 
        further solidifies the need for a significant increase in the number of 
        hot tubs and saunas on campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin can be a pretty depressing place and there is no doubt in my 
        mind that this leads directly to a lack of meaningful discussion and a 
        host of other problems on campus, including the general social awkwardness 
        of our student population. The bathhouse would mitigate these concerns 
        as well. What better place to talk to a fellow student about the Enron 
        crisis or Bush's enlightened energy policy then the confines of a steamy 
        sauna or bubbly hot tub? What better place to relax casually with members 
        of the opposite sex then a bathhouse? <br>
      </p>
      <p>The list of things I would rather do in a Greek-style bathhouse could 
        go on for several pages, but you get the point. Imagine the next time 
        a prospective student asks a tour guide about the savagery of the Maine 
        winter. No more hesitation, gentle sobbing, and tales of anti-depressants-now 
        we can take tours of excited students and nervous parents right through 
        our Greek-style bathhouse and explain to them the benefits of going to 
        a school with such a resource. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Obviously, the issue of funding will come up as the College moves ahead 
        with plans to build the bathhouse, but I seriously doubt that Bowdoin's 
        fundraisers will struggle to find a rich alum willing to put his or her 
        name and bankroll behind the project. If we can find people willing to 
        spend their money on new &quot;theaters&quot; and &quot;Astroturf fields,&quot; 
        then surely there must be someone willing to support the construction 
        of a building full of hot tubs and saunas. Who can argue with hot tubs? 
        Is anyone prepared to make an argument against saunas?<br>
