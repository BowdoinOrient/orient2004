      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Early Decision Phase I phase of admissions began 
        on December 6, and once again, a record number of applications were submitted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications were up 16 percent from last year. So far, 
        the admissions committee is predicting similar increases in the regular 
        application pool. This reflects a trend, not only at Bowdoin College, 
        but in select schools all across the nation, as each student is, on average, 
        applying to more and more colleges. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, students are increasingly taking advantage 
        of the Early Decision option, believing that their chances of admission 
        will increase due to their stronger enthusiasm for the College. However, 
        Bowdoin does not strongly endorse this route, and instead encourages students 
        to "take their time when making such an important decision," according 
        to Richard Steele, vice president of admissions and student aid. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the committee has only just begun the evaluation 
        process, they are already extremely impressed with the potential and talent 
        of the Class of 2005. Steele was especially impressed with the strength 
        of the teacher recommendations, a factor that is weighted especially heavily 
        in the Bowdoin admissions process. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candidates are rated in six different categories, and 
        the first factor considered is the student's essay and personal statement. 
        While most schools require only one essay, Bowdoin places extra emphasis 
        on writing ability and personality reflected through an essay. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steele explained that the next part of the application 
        taken into consideration is the teacher recommendation, which provides 
        a glimpse into the student's approach to learning and their enthusiasm 
        for education. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caliber of the school is also factored in, and 
        officers look at what is available to students in terms of advanced placement 
        courses, extracurricular activities, grades, and other aspects. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another unique aspect of the admissions process 
        at Bowdoin is that SAT scores are not a mandatory part of the application. 
        While they are helpful tools in gauging a student's skill level, Steele 
        notes that "if [the applicants] don't have scores, we don't assume that 
        they were bad, but it just means more detective work and closer scrutiny 
        of the rest of the application."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Bowdoin does not believe in automatically 
        deferring all candidates not admitted in the Early Decision phase, believing 
        that it is "not fair to students to string them along if they would be 
        better off at another school," Steele said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He noted that it is too early to draw any conclusions 
        about the class of 2005, but he stated that no two classes are alike, 
        and each contributes to the Bowdoin community in its own way. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When asked what sets Bowdoin applications apart from 
        others he's seen in the business, Steele commented on the independent 
        spirit present in the applications. He partly attributed it to the rustic 
        geographic location of Bowdoin, but this cannot be completely responsible 
        for the adventurous nature of the students which is present in their eagerness 
        to travel, to risk low grades for a challenging course, or to simply take 
        up a new sport or activity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steele said that the admissions process, while exciting, 
        can be draining, as it is difficult to say "no" to students who are certain 
        they want to attend Bowdoin. However, Steele is comforted by the fact 
        that "if they don't get in here, they will most likely get into another 
        terrific school." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the same token, his favorite part of the review 
        process is learning about the quality of the students. "I have done this 
        work since 1962, and I never fail to be excited when I read applications 
        and learn about young people's talent and their potential for the future."
