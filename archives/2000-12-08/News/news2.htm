      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten years of delays, Portland may finally hear 
        passenger train whistles as early as April of next year when Amtrak service 
        is expected to arrive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Murray, executive director of Northern New England 
        Passenger Rail Authority, said that his organization is focusing on an 
        April 2001 startup when it will inaugurate service from Boston's North 
        Station to Portland.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The route will be 114 miles long and will include stops 
        in Haverhill, Massachusetts; Exeter, New Hampshire; Dover, New Hampshire; 
        Wells, Maine; and Saco, Maine. The train will also stop at the University 
        of New Hampshire at Durham on weekends and at Old Orchard, Maine, during 
        the summer. In total, the trip from Boston to Portland should take approximately 
        two and a half hours and cost between $30 and $40 round trip.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about service to Brunswick, Murray 
        said, "Plans, which I believe to be realistic, are underway now to make 
        the connection go north…to Brunswick." This connection may not come anytime 
        soon, though, as Murray said the goal was to reach Brunswick in April 
        of 2003.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a full year and a half later than a previous 
        estimate. In an article in the November 5, 1999 issue of the <i>Orient</i>, 
        Murray had estimated that Amtrak service would come to Brunswick as early 
        as late 2001.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When questioned about the wait for train service into 
        Maine, Murray admitted, "There have been a series of delays over the past 
        ten years."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brunswick Town Manager Don Gerrish said that one of 
        those delays was in Boston. "[Getting train service into Maine] was a 
        problem because of the Big Dig."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question yet to be addressed is that of a Brunswick 
        train station. The lot intended for the station is across the railroad 
        tracks from Shop 'n Save, next to the McLellan Building.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the delay of Amtrak service, though, the 
        town has not made any concrete plans for the construction of the station. 
        "We want to plan what we do with an understanding of the time frame," 
        Gerrish said.</p>
