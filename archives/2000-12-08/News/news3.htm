      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenneth I. Chenault '73, 
      president of American Express, will be promoted next month to become the 
      first black CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of a blue-chip company listed 
      on the Dow Jones.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Originally, Chenault had been slated to succeed his boss Harvey 
      Golub at a shareholders' meeting in the spring of 2001, but in April of 
      1999 Golub announced his intention to retire at the end of 2000.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Chenault has been credited as being the key to the recent revitalization 
      of American Express, which he joined in 1981. His contributions to the $19.1 
      billion company include reducing operating costs of his divisions by $3 
      billion and creating new alliances, which increased the number of cards 
      offered by the company and thus cultivated new card holders. He was named 
      president of American Express in 1997.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While at Bowdoin, Chenault was an active member of the 
      African-American Society and graduated <i>magna cum laude</i> as a history 
      major with honors. After leaving Bowdoin, Chenault earned his law degree 
      from Harvard University in 1976. He has also participated in fund-raising 
      for The Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families in New York City, which 
      is headed by another Bowdoin alumnus, Geoffrey Canada '74.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chenault was awarded an honorary degree by the College 
      in 1996. His speech during the commencement exercise emphasized what he 
      called "two key messages"-the need for a more inclusive society and the 
      need for a "greater adherence to principles and values in guiding our behavior." 
      Chenault was, at that time, the vice chairman of American Express.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colleagues have been quoted as saying that Chenault has 
      a great deal of integrity. One top executive was quoted by Black Enterprise 
      as saying, "If a man at that level-black, white or green-doesn't have a 
      certain amount of ego or fire, then he can't do the job. You have to be 
      pleasant to be around, but decisive and clinical about your decisions while 
      remaining humane, and [Chenault] has all those qualities."<!-- #EndEditable -->
