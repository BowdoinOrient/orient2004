Some of you might flip open your little black agenda books and find that it signifies the last day in a row that is neatly framed with the pink highlighter you decided to use to designate \ldblquote Reading Week,\rdblquote  which comes right before the neat transition into the use of the green highlighter border that signifies \ldblquote exam period,\rdblquote  which is followed by an explosion of metallic silver-pen snowflakes surrounding a swirly-lettered \ldblquote December Break, Hooray!\rdblquote  \par For those of you whose little black agenda books have become the thing in the bottom of your bag that questionable trash sticks to, December 12 will likely involve sitting in a dimly lit desk in H&L, stubbornly trying to decipher notes from early October through drool smears and doodles of your professor as a giant Mr. Coffee Maker. \par And if the words \ldblquote little,\rdblquote  \ldblquote black,\rdblquote  and \ldblquote book\rdblquote  only conjure up a brilliant Heidi Fleiss joke you heard once, well, you\rquote ll likely be coming to the tail end of the gauntlet of partying destined to turn \ldblquote reading week\rdblquote  into \ldblquote reading-seventeen-minutes-before-the-exam.\rdblquote  \par Whatever possibilities December 12 might hold for you, there is one man in America for whom December 12 is very important. It is on December 12 that the states must pick their electors, and it is by this rapidly approaching deadline that Vice President Al Gore must somehow theoretically both win a Florida Supreme Court appeal and count a daunting number of ballots.\par There doesn\rquote t seem to be any fear that the political cliffhanger leading up to this date will severely distract from the pursuit of Bowdoin students\rquote  various reading week activities. And it\rquote s not that they are apathetic or don\rquote t care, or even that they are particularly bored with the affair. \par It\rquote s just that most students seemed to have accepted that Bush is going to be the next president, relegating Gore\rquote s desperate attempts to the realm of ignorable sideshow spectacle.  For much of the nation, the deciding moment came when the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Bush campaign on Monday.  \par Under one of the harshest public spotlights in recent memory, the Court did everything right, with each aspect of the proceeding providing a refreshing contrast to the antics which had characterized the campaign and election so far. The Court released audiotapes, giving the proceedings an open and inclusive feel, while simultaneously maintaining the Court\rquote s mystique. \par And as off-putting as solemnity of the judges\rquote  red velvet curtains and oak-lined private chambers might be, they were a relief after a campaign that gleefully exposed every gold star and pimple the candidates had ever produced. \par  They ruled at near light-speed in \ldblquote Supreme Court\rdblquote  time, and no mention need really be made of how long this election has felt in comparison.  Most importantly, the Court avoided falling into one of its typical 5-4 voting patterns, which would have only served to mirror the narrow divisions and petty squabbling present in both the presidential and congressional elections. Instead they issued an unsigned opinion as a single, just, judicial organism, and even refused to interfere with the autonomy of the state of Florida any more than they absolutely had to. \par Everyone, from compassionate conservatives to flag-patterned, bra-burning liberals, from the Rockefellers to the rock-bottomers, from the soccer moms to the soccer balls, could take some comfort and invest confidence in the Court\rquote s exquisite non-decision.\par \ldblquote But wait!\rdblquote  you might be thinking right now, \ldblquote I thought Gore\rquote s support was stronger than ever. Why, there has been new evidence that Gore will eventually be able to claim a victory in Florida of tens of thousands of votes.\rdblquote  And, \ldblquote Isn\rquote t this the first time throughout the campaign when}{ }{\cf0 the Democrats have displayed such solidarity?\rdblquote  \par Well the truth is that this display is mostly a strategy based on the assumption that Bush will be elected the next president. For several reasons, a Bush victory has come to be seen as fairly appealing among many of even the most loyal Democrats. \par First of all, it would obviously end this tiresome game of tug-o-Florida. Second, the events of the last month have made Bush\rquote s willingness to \ldblquote reach across the aisles\rdblquote  and compromise with Democrats an all the more essential component of legitimizing his own presidency. Gore\rquote s tendency to want to have a hand in every aspect of his sprawling job might have struck some as a more presidential response to governing than Bush\rquote s plan to surrounding himself with brilliant people. \par But coupled with the disgust at the extraordinary measures already undertaken in pursuit of this presidency, this attitude would likely bring his presidency to an almost complete standstill with the Republican dominated congress. \par  The issue which inspired the most passion and fear in Bowdoin students throughout the election was certainly that of the US Supreme Court nominations, which seem to be in the hands of the next president. \par It is likely that the compromising spirit inspired by the electoral contest will spill over from other areas into this one as well. Bush knows he cant afford to appear to be responsible for the repeal of Roe v. Wade, at least not if he wants himself or his party to have any hope of maintaining control after these four years. \par Gore\rquote s people, however, are banking on the combination of a looming recession and the martyr currency of Gore dramatically winning Florida in post-electoral college recounts.  For now, Gore is being pressured to continue by the very unified Democratic supporters who ultimately know and hope that Bush will win. \par Kind of a hard place to be for a vice-president, even if it is only for another four days. So wherever you are, whoever you are, take a moment out on December 12 for Gore, and if you\rquote re really quiet, you\rquote ll probably be able to hear his trademark sigh all the way here in Brunswick. Only this time it will be in relief. \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs48 \par \par \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Features2}{\fs28 \par }{\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Letter from London: Sightseeing}{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \v\f4\cgrid {\tc {\v }{\v\fs64 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Letter from London: Sightseeing}}}{\fs48 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 James Fisher}{\b\scaps \par }{\caps\fs16 staff writer}{\fs48 \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\adjustright \f20\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 LONDON\emdash If I were a pessimist, I\rquote d say gobal warming has come to London.\par This week it\rquote s been unusually warm, in the 50s (11 degrees C to us). The rain has also dropped off, although this fall has been the wettest in over 200 years\emdash 18 inches of rain have drenched the streets of the city in the past few months. \par Right now, though, it\rquote s no more rainy than Maine is, and it\rquote s warmer. (True story: I overheard a Colby freshman who hails from California (here at the CBB London Center before beginning the February term) ask her friend, \ldblquote Does it get this cold in Maine?\rdblquote  when it was about 35-40 F outside. Colby\emdash the school of hard knocks.) \par So I\rquote m taking advantage of the weather by cramming in all the sights I haven\rquote t gotten around to this semester, of which there are plenty. \par I feel guilty when I admit that, while I\rquote ve been here for almost three months, I haven\rquote t seen a single theatrical production (but have made time for three or four movies) or been to Buckingham Palace, Windsor, or the Tower of London. I haven\rquote t even been to the Millennium Dome, which will almost surely be demolished or made into office space early next year. \par I don\rquote t feel so bad about skipping the Dome; actually, it\rquote s one of the most insulted and hated tourist attractions in the world, and no one hates it more than the London taxpayer, who sees it as an ugly, bloated financial black hole which has deprived him of part of his pension and made his pint cost more. No one goes to see it\emdash they\rquote d be laughed at if anyone knew they did. \par I\rquote m making up for it in these last few weeks. I went to Aberdeen, Scotland, recently, where it was much colder than in London and where a large statue of William Wallace (think }{\i\cf0 Braveheart}{\cf0 ) occupies the town square. \par This weekend, I\rquote m going to Windsor. Not for the castle, though, but for Legoland. The Dutch, who first invented Legos, have licensed a park just half an hour outside of London. I was a big Lego collector when I was a kid; I hope I can fit into the rides now. \par Mostly, though, I want to soak up what I know about London already, and revel in it. I have become a temporary citizen here. I know the tube; I know the language and customs of coffee shops, restaurants, and pubs; I know the major news stories; I know the TV channels, all five of them; I know what is worth buying from the Indian grocery store down the street and what spices to leave alone. \par I\rquote m more interested in European Union news than charges of election-stealing somewhere in the south\emdash Georgia, I think. What\rquote s going on with the election anyway? I haven\rquote t been able to find out who}{ }{\cf0 won\u8230\'c9 \par For me, the point of studying away seems not to involve setting the customs of my temporary native land against the standards of my country, but to temporarily forget my country has any standards. I\rquote ll do the comparisons when I get home, not now. \par This isn\rquote t to say that I don\rquote t miss home, or Bowdoin. I haven\rquote t been able to bike or hike here at all; it hasn\rquote t snowed; I only saw my dad here in London briefly as he was returning from a business trip, so I certainly miss my family. \par It seems like the Bowdoin campus is pretty active this year (or at least controversy in the pages of the }{\i\cf0 Orient}{\cf0  is). But time is short now: only one week of classes and then one of exams is left before we leave.

Seriously, once asked, I will }{\i\cf0 not }{\cf0 shut up. So, in the spirit of the \ldblquote common good,\rdblquote  I\rquote ve decided to get the car bug out of my system and to provide anyone fortunate enough to pick up this week\rquote s }{\i\cf0 Orient }{\cf0 with the general basics on cars.\par Back in my senior year of high school, I replaced my \rquote 86 Escort (a horror story if ever there was one) with a shiny \rquote 76 Mustang. Let me say this: if ever you want a crash course in basic car repair, buy a vehicle older than you are. When stuff gets old, it just breaks\emdash weird stuff, stuff you\rquote d never even think of.  Here are some things I\rquote ve learned through the years: \par }{\i\cf0 Whatcha Got in There?}{\cf0 :}{\b\cf0  }{\cf0 On occasion, I\rquote ve been surprised when I\rquote ve asked a few friends of mine what type of engines their cars have\emdash few have any idea. This is useful knowledge, folks. The first thing an auto parts store clerk asks you is what the year, model, and engine type of your car are. \par Also, I can\rquote t help but think that a devious mechanic might instinctively think \ldblquote sucker\rdblquote  when he meets somebody that can\rquote t answer this question. Basically, check your owner\rquote s manual. If you can\rquote t figure it out, look under the hood. \par What is that big thing with all of the hoses coming out of it? That is your engine, folks. What type is it? Basically, engines are categorized by their number of cylinders: usually four, six, or eight, unless you\rquote re lucky enough to own a Viper. \par To count cylinders easily, look for spark plugs. These are identified by the big fat wires that attach to them. There\rquote s one plug per cylinder, so this is sort of a gimme. If they are all in a single row, this is a \ldblquote straight\rdblquote  engine, i.e. a \ldblquote straight six\rdblquote  or a \ldblquote straight eight.\rdblquote  \par If your engine has a single row of four cylinders but those cylinders run sideways, from left to right, rather than front to back, this is a \ldblquote transverse mounted four.\rdblquote  This seems trivial, but a lot of compact cars have these, maybe even yours. What is a \ldblquote V-6\rdblquote  or a \ldblquote V-8?\rdblquote  In this set up, the cylinders are in two parallel rows slanted toward one another; hence, you either have two rows of four, or two rows of three.\par }{\i\cf0 Uncle Buck Syndrome}{\cf0 :}{\b\cf0  }{\cf0 When you start up your car, do you ever worry that anybody standing to the rear of your vehicle might get carbon monoxide poisoning? If your car is kicking out too much exhaust, any number of things might be wrong. First, make sure that you are not, in fact, driving a steam locomotive. \par No? Well, if there is a blue haze that puffs out of your tailpipe when you start your car, this is burning oil. This is common when a car reaches its golden era: nothing to worry about really, it\rquote s just that, while the car sits, oil seeps into where it shouldn\rquote t, and when starting, it burns the oil off. Your engine is aging, and rings and gaskets aren\rquote t what they used to be. \par If your car puffs blue smoke all the time, get to a mechanic and prepare either for a new car or for some expensive maintenance; cars run on gasoline, not 10-W30. If your car is smoking too much, and the smoke isn\rquote t blue, and you have a lot of black soot in your tailpipe, see a mechanic. Chances are your fuel mixture is off (the triangle of combustion: air, fuel, and heat).\par Too much gas is running \ldblquote rich,\rdblquote  too much air is running \ldblquote lean.\rdblquote  On my old, carborated car, I can tinker with this. As your car is probably fuel-injected, }{\i\cf0 don\rquote t touch anything. }{\cf0 Who knows, maybe you\rquote ll save some gas money?\par }{\i\cf0 What\rquote s That Noise?}{\cf0 :}{\b\cf0  }{\cf0 Again, if you aren\rquote t sure, see a mechanic. Still, some basics.\par Screeching every time you start the car and punch on the gas means you have a loose belt. This is very easy to fix. Basically, tighten the belt. \par Most cars have flywheels (what the belts attach to) that are on little pivots and slots. You can loosen a couple screws, pry the flywheel as far out as you can so that the belt is tight, and tighten the screws again. \par To determine if a belt is loose, I have personally developed a very scientific analysis known as the \ldblquote wiggle test\rdblquote \emdash try it if you dare. If that doesn\rquote t work, get a new belt\emdash they\rquote re cheap. \par If the car makes a groaning/grumbling/creaking noise when it comes to a stop, check your brake pads and rotors! Most likely, you\rquote ll want to see a professional (if you could do it yourself, you wouldn\rquote t be reading this anyway). Brakes are very important if you like being able to stop your car. \par If, when you turn your wheel over hard, especially when going slow, there\rquote s this rasping or rubbing noise, it could mean several things. Maybe your wheel is rubbing something. Maybe it\rquote s your power steering fluid. Maybe your power steering pump is on its last leg. \par First, check the fluid and fill \lquote er up if she\rquote s low. If you still have a problem, see a mechanic. \par If there\rquote s a \ldblquote tick-a-tick-a-tick-a\rdblquote  noise whenever your engine is on, particularly when you punch the gas, most likely, your lifters are clicking. Check your oil! This noise is a bad sign. If you add oil and it\rquote s still clicking away, see a mechanic. \par This is a good time to mention that one should never wait until the red oil warning light comes on to check one\rquote s oil. If the light is burned out, or if there\rquote s a problem with the sensor, you could drive for hundreds, maybe thousands of miles with your engine parts grating and chewing against each other\_}{\i\cf0 this}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 could kill your car!}{\cf0 \par I hope that someday this will save somebody here some trouble.

To start with, Hal and I got a ride with a college friend as far as Washington, D.C., where we spent two nights and one day sight-seeing. \par Arriving late at night, I remember being driven down Pennsylvania Avenue, with my first glimpse of the Capitol dome at one end and the White House at the other, both lit up. (Years later at a London antiquarian\rquote s, I was to buy a series of prints of early American scenes, including one, on the wall behind me, of the Capitol under construction, with the dome still missing). \par Early in the morning of our second day in Washington, Hal and I boarded a Greyhound bus bound for Jacksonville, Florida. \par It was already so crowded that we only just managed to get a couple of seats in the back where, to my surprise, sat only black people, eyeing two white kids curiously, or indifferently, except for one or two who gave us hostile stares. \par Whenever the bus stopped on its way through the Deep South, I was amazed to see restaurant and toilet facilities marked \ldblquote Whites Only\rdblquote  or \ldblquote Colored,\rdblquote  into which our seat neighbors obediently trooped. \par It was the first time I was directly confronted with the iniquitous practice of racial segregation. Yet this was the year 1954, and the Supreme Court\emdash the third seat of power in the famous system of \ldblquote checks and balances\rdblquote  that Professor Whiteside used to talk about\emdash had handed down a historic decision banning segregation in public schools, heralding the beginning of the end of US-style Apartheid and the dawn of an entirely new era in racial relations. \par Another thing that amazed me even though I was by now fairly fluent in English and attuned to the way most Americans spoke it, was that I could barely understand what the blacks sitting with us said, their southern-accented speech being all but incomprehensible to me. Fortunately, Hal, not the least bit prejudiced, sat on the aisle, and I marveled at the way he responded in kind to their good-natured banter. \par Hal\rquote s father, a big man with big hands, met us on arrival in late afternoon at the Daytona bus station. Taking both of my hands in his, he welcomed me as warmly as Simon\rquote s mother and aunt had, after hugging his son. I can still see his big, kindly face beaming down at me. \par The next day, with temperatures in the high seventies, we went for a swim in the ocean, and on Christmas Eve, we went to midnight mass in the Reverend Tucker\rquote s church. \par Emerging into the balmy night, standing beneath palm trees and looking up at the starry sky, I couldn\rquote t believe it was Christmas. The next morning, sitting on a sofa in the Tuckers\rquote  living-room with Hal, his little sister Kathy between us, we exchanged presents. \par I forget what I gave Harold, but he gave me (I must have asked him for it) a book called }{\i\cf0 The Invisible Writing, }{\cf0 by Arthur Koestler, a Hungarian-born Jew and lapsed Communist, author of }{\i\cf0 Darkness at Noon, }{\cf0 a post-war bestseller pillorying Stalinist Communism. \par Kathy\rquote s present from me was a Bowdoin skunk that, according to a diary I started that day, she named Lou, after me, because she said she liked him as much, and, \ldblquote he\rquote ll always be with us.\rdblquote  I wonder what\rquote s become of that little toy and the little girl it gave such pleasure to. \par (Kathy did incidentally spell her name with a K, as I see from one of my letters written home, reporting on my Florida Christmas, beneath which she scrawled her name.) \par Hal, already a chaplain\rquote s assistant at college eventually became a Reverend like his Dad. Sadly we lost touch, and a letter I wrote to him last summer care of an address in Wiscasset, Maine, given to me by the alumni office, has gone unanswered or astray. \par The little diary, bought at the student union shop on campus, with RECORD in gold-embossed letters on the stiff black cover, begins thus: \ldblquote Thinking makes me happy. Koestler confirms that speaking and thinking in a new language transforms one\rquote s pattern of thought}{\i\cf0 .}{\cf0 \rdblquote  This profound (even if not entirely original) insight is followed by the bit about Kathy and her Bowdoin skunk.\par On the penultimate day of the year, Hal and I drove over to St. Petersburg. Standing on the seashore together looking out over the Gulf of Mexico, I said to him, again according to my little friend the diary, that sometimes I thought I too might become a minister. \ldblquote But it wouldn\rquote t work,\rdblquote  I pencilled in afterwards. \par I was to keep up the diary till nearly the end of the school year and shall quote from it again. In my second and final year at Bowdoin, I kept a more voluminous one, more of a journal, in conscious imitation of the famous one of Andr\u233\'8e Gide, a new favorite author, not on the reading list either. Another was Thomas Mann. \par Starting back for Brunswick on the last day of the year, we stopped over in Boston\emdash incredibly enough staying at the Parker House Hotel (Nellie must have given me the money, since she spent Christmas with friends in Bogota, still safe)\emdash and celebrated New Year\rquote s Eve by going to the movies to see }{\i\cf0 There\rquote s No Business Like Show Business}{\cf0 , with Ethel Merman. \par Besides Merman belting out the famous hit song, there was a scene, or rather a sequence, in the film I never forgot. It showed the image of her partner or lover\emdash movie buffs will remember the actor\rquote s name\emdash superimposed on railroad tracks along which he is seen walking away on tour without her, with large calendar leaves falling like real ones all about him to indicate the passage of time. \par The sequence struck such a cord because it reminded me of a similar scene four months earlier, almost to the day. On August 30, standing at the back of an express train speeding through perfectly flat countryside towards Rotterdam, where my fellow Fulbrights and I were to board ship for New York. I was all but mesmerized by the two gleaming parallel lines seemingly converging at some hazy point in the distance, beyond which lay my home in the Rhineland. I had come a long way.\par With that image, I\rquote d like to leave kind }{\i\cf0 Orient }{\cf0 readers who have faithfully followed the author\rquote s travels and}{\b\cf0  }{\cf0 collegiate travails over a sitar span of time, and who will hopefully resume doing so next semester, beneath wintry pines. \par In the meantime, here\rquote s wishing you }{\i\cf0 Fr\u246\'9ahliche Weihnachten}{\cf0 , and a happy new year.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs48 \par \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Features6}{\fs28 \par }{\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 O.O.

In the West, Vicksburg had fallen, opening the Mississippi to Union ships. At Chattanooga, Ulysses S. Grant had all but destroyed the major Confederate army in the west, and at sea, the Union blockade was choking the rebellion\rquote s supplies from across the Atlantic. \par Only in the east was there a problem. After four bloody years of advance and retreat, the Union Army of the Potomac had still been unable to end the career of Robert E. Lee and his legendary Army of Northern Virginia. \par As Sam Grant went east to deal with Lee in early 1864, plans for an offensive in the west were underway.\par Since the first major battle at Bull Run in 1861, Oliver Howard had been a part of the Civil War. But his rise in the east had been halted by the disaster at Chancellorsville and at Gettysburg. \par Sent west to help relieve Chattanooga, Howard finally escaped the command of the luckless eastern generals: Bad Luck McDowell, Gutless McClellan, Brainless Burnside, All-Talk Hooker, and most recently Bad-Tempered Meade. \par Now he was under the command of a man who loved to talk, fight and smoke cigars. Having shared the battlefield at Bull Run with Howard, William Tecumseh Sherman certainly had heard of the general from Maine. \par Winter 1863 saw rest and refit for the Union armies. Howard himself received thanks from Sherman for helping out with the relief of Knoxville. Sherman called Howard a \ldblquote polished Christian gentleman\rdblquote  and a \ldblquote prompt, zealous,\u8230\'c9gallant soldier.\rdblquote  \par High praise indeed from a man who knew good fighters when he saw them. After placing his men in winter quarters, Howard had a chance to return to Maine for a quick visit with his family. \par When he returned at the beginning of the year he found that his friends in high places had been at work on his behalf again. Congress had just voted to give thanks to Howard for his role in the Battle of Gettysburg. \par Included in the congressional thanks were also the names of Joe Hooker and George Meade. Thus the document was strange in that Hooker\rquote s name was attached\emdash he wasn\rquote t even at Gettysburg\emdash and that General Winfield Scott Hancock\emdash arguably the savior of Gettysburg\emdash was not mentioned. (The author wishes to include that he is partially biased since he is a big fan of General Hancock.) \par The Congressional thanks sparked controversy down the years between Howard and Hancock supporters. Certainly Howard himself was concerned about the document. He was troubled on a spiritual level since the controversy would affect his image as a Christian soldier. Whatever his inner turmoil, all around him things were moving fast.\par The Spring 1864 Union Offensive was simple; Grant would attack Lee, and Sherman would attack Joseph Johnston\rquote s Confederate army on his way to Atlanta, the heart of the Confederacy. \par Sherman worked fast in getting his men in order. At the start of the campaign, he would have close to 1,100,000 men in three armies: The Army of the Cumberland under General George H. Thomas, The Army of the Tennessee under General James McPherson, and The Army of the Ohio under General John Schofield. \par In reorganizing his commands, Sherman combined Howard\rquote s Eleventh and Henry Slocum\rquote s Twelfth Corps to form the Twentieth Corps under General Joe Hooker. \par Howard was given a new corps to command. The Mainer went from commanding German immigrants to hard-fighting Western veterans from the Fourth Army Corps. \par Sherman\rquote s men trained not just in military drill but also in repairing the vital railroad, which would be the supply line for the armies once the campaign began. \par But certainly the energetic Sherman did not spend all his days working. Taking time off from his daily tasks, Sherman and a division commander, General Jefferson C. Davis, once made fun of Howard\rquote s religious dispositions by having a swearing marathon in front of him. Howard left, opening Sherman to comment on his lack of humor!\par The Atlanta Campaign opened on May 4, coinciding with Grant\rquote s attack on Lee\rquote s lines in Virginia. The Confederates under Joe Johnston awaited the Federals at a steep, twenty-mile long ridge called Rocky Face Ridge. \par Studying the position and finding it not practical to attack, Sherman adopted a plan by George Thomas; he would feint with two armies and send one circling around to get at the rebel rear near the town of Resaca. \par The movement went fine, but the arrival of rebel reinforcements forced the plan to fail in the end. Sherman, knowing that the game was up, moved his entire force, minus Howard and some cavalry, to Resaca via a gap in Rock Face. \par Once the rebels withdrew from his front, Howard pursued and approached Resaca from the north while attempting to link up with the rest of the Union troops, now on his right. His force being small, the rebels attacked Howard on May 14 but retreated once Howard called up reinforcements. \par Sherman attacked Johnston, and finding that the rebel position was too strong, swung wide around the Confederate flank to threaten their supply line. Johnston retreated slowly and sat waiting for Sherman at a place called Cassville. There he planned to attack and cripple a third of the Federal forces before they could concentrate. \par The attack was not sprung due to the arrival of some lost Federal troops in the rebel rear. Johnston gave ground again, backing away to Allatoona Pass. Sherman\rquote s movements had been swift, and his advance had been remarkable compared to the situation in the east at the same time. \par Within eleven days, Sherman was almost halfway to his objective in Atlanta. His soldiers were happy since their supplies were also moving as fast. \ldblquote The rapidity with which the badly broken railroad was repaired seemed miraculous,\rdblquote  Howard wrote. \par With his supplies at maximum, Sherman could afford to leave the railroad for a couple of days, which is what he did when he cut loose and marched beyond Johnston\rquote s left flank to land his force around a town called Dallas. \par On May 27, Howard was ordered to attack the rebel right near Pickett\rquote s Mill. Due to some poor scouting, Howard did not strike the end of the rebel line as he had intended, but rather ran headlong into Confederate General Patrick Cleburne\rquote s division\emdash the very best men the rebels had. Howard was bloodily and swiftly repulsed, leaving him with 1500 casualties. \par Then the rains began, and for seventeen days, the downpour did not end. The Union men became demoralized in the mud that soon swamped them. The June rains were \ldblquote the hardest times the army experienced,\rdblquote  Howard later commented. \par Sherman shifted his armies and brought them again astride the Western & Atlantic Railroad, where supplies were collected. By now Sherman was beginning to feel agitated. He had long been from the school of \ldblquote come on out and lets fight to the death\rdblquote  warfare. \par Joe Johnston, unfortunately, did not want to play Sherman\rquote s game. Thinking that his men were getting weak from the constant marching, Sherman declared that an all attack was probably necessary. \par In the meantime, he scouted the rebel positions at Pine Mountain. There, on June 14, Joe Johnston and two of his commanders\emdash General William Hardee and General Leonidas Polk, a West Pointer and a bishop turned general\emdash met to observe the Federals. \par Sherman also observed them and turned to Howard, who was in command of the line at that point. He told Howard to send some artillery shells over to scare them off. Howard sent word to his gunners who were already in action. With just two shots from Battery I of the 1st Ohio Light Artillery, the high command of the rebel army was changed forever. \par Polk lay dead on the field; drawing tears from both Johnston and Hardee while Sherman, upon hearing of the death, jubilantly reported it to Washington and became more determined than ever to attack the rebel line.\par Johnston withdrew his troops from Pine Mountain and waited for Sherman at Kennesaw Mountain.\par To Be Continued.\par Next Time: Kennesaw Mountain & Atlanta.\par \par Sources Used:\par 1.
