Last Thursday, however, the Bowdoin Squash Team had the privilege to play against the University of Cape Town South Africa. \par The University of Cape Town team decided to add Bowdoin at the last minute to its roster of opponents on its North American tour. The Bowdoin women had no idea what to expect about the South Africans\rquote  skill level or what kind of a challenge they faced. \par It ended up being a very close match, but the Polar Bears managed to pull out on top. The women ultimately beat South Africa 3-2, which came down to a tiebreaker in Liz Steffey\rquote s match. Dana Betts, Liz Steffey, Merrill Muckerman, Lindy Stanley, and Laura Inkeles were the only Bowdoin women to play, because the University of Cape Town only brought five women. \par Sophomore Merrill Muckerman brought in the first win by beating her opponent in four games.

After losing the first two games, Liz started to focus in the third and began playing the squash she is capable of. Liz came back to win the next two games, which meant that they were going the long haul to five games. \par Both women were tired and the intensity was up in the fifth game.

Superwoman Liz did not lose her head and pulled out the victory. \par The other senior co-captain, Dana Betts, conferred Bowdoin its other win to take the match. Dana played smart, aggressive squash and was quick on her feet, which allowed her to control the game, winning 3-0. \par Dana commented, \ldblquote She was a good player.

So maybe it\rquote s a fair statement to say that track athletes must be super tough because their whole sport is considered punishment. \par However, despite the talent and discipline runners demonstrate\emdash from the explosive speed of the 55m dash to the grueling stamina it takes to finish the 300m run\emdash there is a whole other world that exists during the Indoor Track season: the field events.\par Believe it or not, there is much more to the field events than meets the eye. Sure, long jump seems pretty easy, and it even looks like fun to land in a pit of sand. However, it takes a tremendous amount of speed to carry the jumper down the runway, explosive legs to propel her up and forward through the air as well as coordination between the arms and legs to maximize the distance of the jump before the landing.\par The hurdles are not the easiest event, either. Think about how hard it must be to sprint as fast as you can with obstacles in your way!  There is a certain rhythm to the hurdles that enables the ideal number of strides to be taken between each hurdle, as well as ensure that the appropriate leg will be forward to get over them. There is a definite technique necessary in hurdling that cuts down the time it takes to get over the hurdle and ensure that no mishaps with the hurdles take place.  Hurdlers are known for their creative injuries and perilous adventures with the hurdles.\par Or what about the high jump? How easy can it really be for women to powerfully drive their bodies five feet or higher into the air off one foot, arch gracefully over a bar and land into a pit below them?  There is a great deal of precision with respect to the number of springing strides taken to approach the bar at a specific speed in order to ensure the optimal position for the penultimate step and final plant to take off.\par Throwing seems like one of those events that just about anybody could do. The shot put looks like an oversized softball, but the eight-pound, thirteen-ounce implement would cause serious shoulder and elbow injuries if you attempted to throw it like a softball. Throwing entails much more than upper body strength. A good thrower derives much of her power from strong legs swiftly gliding backwards across the throwing circle, coordinated with a powerful torso and strong upper body to project the implement forward. All of this force is thrown into one swiftly coordinated movement, transferring all of your weight forward without losing footing and risking a foul by losing balance and stepping out of the circle.\par Many people specialize in certain inter-related field events. For instance, a shot}{\cf0  }{\cf0 putter may also throw the twenty-pound weight during the season, while a long jumper might compete in the triple jump as well. \par Runners often double up on events in meets, perhaps running the 55m dash as well as the 4x200m relay. Generally speaking, individuals who specialize in the throws do not make the best distance runners while a high jumper may not make the best thrower. This idea is what makes the pentathlon such an amazing event.\par The pentathlon is an event where individuals must perform the 55m high hurdles, high jump, shot put, long jump, and 800m run. This is a true test of speed, agility, explosiveness, and endurance. Competing in five different events is both mentally taxing and physically draining. It is often difficult to regroup after a poor performance when you know that there are four events left to complete. Even after a solid performance it can be difficult to psych yourself up for each additional event.\par It takes a truly unique individual to want to compete under these circumstances, and train for such a variety of events. Only well conditioned athletes with versatile ability can fearlessly run the hurdles, gracefully and flexibly high jump, powerfully throw the shot put, explosively long jump, and have enough energy to race a tough 800m.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 If anyone is interested in seeing this event, you can catch Julia Febiger \rquote 03 and Caitlin Fowkes \rquote 03 at Bates today, December 8 at 3:00 p.m.., representing the Bowdoin Women\rquote s Track Team at the ultimate indoor track challen\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 ge.}{\par \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs48\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports4{\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Men\rquote s basketball team moves to 4-2}{\fs28 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 J.

While they won the game, they missed an opportunity to reach the 100 point barrier, which would have been cool. Baranowski once again was a dominant force as he outweighed Maritime\rquote s center by a conservative estimate of a hundred pounds. \par However, Baranowski, Clement, and company could not keep the winning streak alive as the Bobcats erased a two-point half-time deficit to defeat the Polar Bears.

After that, the Polar Bears came into last weekend\rquote s doubleheader with the fire.  On Saturday, they stepped into the rink with the Williams Ephs, one of their toughest conference opponents, who also defeated the team in the ECAC tournament last year.\par The game started strong with the P-Bears in control, with Jen Pelkey \rquote 04 scoring with an assist from sophomore Beth Muir.  The Ephs answered quickly back, however, evening the score just twenty-three seconds later.  \par At the end of the first period, the score remained tied at one.  Then, at 11:24 in the second period, Williams pulled ahead by one.  By the end of the second, the Polar Bears tied it back up with a power-play goal from sophomore Alyson Lizotte.  The third period, however, plagued Bowdoin, as the Ephs forced three unanswered goals to end the game: good guys two, bad guys five.  The loss, however, did not discourage the team in the slightest.\par \ldblquote I think that we played very well with our systems.  In the end, we piled up more shots, but we just didn\rquote t capitalize on them. In the second and third periods we dominated more, but the scoreboard didn\rquote t reflect that,\rdblquote  said Muir, a native of Chelmsford, Massachusetts.  \par The Polar Bears finished the game out-shooting the Ephs 47 to 37.  Last year\rquote s leading scorer for the team, Shelly Chessie \rquote 03 said, \ldblquote We played really well at Williams. Technically, we played awesome. Between periods, the coach had no technical complaints.  \par \ldblquote It\rquote s still the beginning of the season, and the team is working with eight first years and nine new players in total. The coach is still switching stuff around; we haven\rquote t figured everything out yet.  Williams was good, but I think we\rquote re going to beat them later in the season.\rdblquote \par Sunday, against the Holy Cross Crusaders, presented a different story.  From the beginning, the Polar Bears dominated the ice, which led to a 7-0 victory.  Last year, Holy Cross only had club women\rquote s ice hockey.  That, on top of the game\rquote s mark as the first two-day doubleheader of the season, left expectations up in the air for the team.\par \ldblquote Going into the game, everyone was still really psyched because we played so well on Saturday, and we wanted to carry that intensity throughout the game,\rdblquote  said Chessie.  After the first period, the game remained scoreless, although the Bears out-shot the Crusaders 16-4.  \ldblquote After the first scoreless period, the coach was basically like, \lquote move it,\rquote \rdblquote  said Muir.\par And that\rquote s exactly what they did\emdash starting in the second period.  By the time 12:26 passed in the period, the Bears had scored four goals, led by first year Gillian McDonald who had two goals and two assists that day.\par \ldblquote It was the first weekend with a doubleheader, so everyone is still getting into it, but we\rquote re a much stronger team than Holy Cross, so the coach emphasized seeing who worked well together,\rdblquote  said Chessie.  \par Muir, who scored the Polar Bears\rquote  final goal in the third period, was also positive.  \ldblquote After the first period, we played well, and overall it was a good game for us.  A lot of different people scored; the distribution was good to see,\rdblquote  said Muir.  \par Tonight, the team faces off against RIT at 5:00 p.m. in what look to be an intense match-up.  \par \ldblquote They\rquote re really scrappy; its not going to be pretty hockey, but everybody is psyched for the game, especially since practices have been going really well.  We\rquote ve got a lot of depth; all the lines are strong,\rdblquote  said Chessie.  \par With a current record of 2-1-0, the team has high expectations for the year, and we can expect some serious conference action against Middlebury in January and a playoff rematch with Williams.\par }}
