So far, the admissions committee is predicting similar increases in the regular application pool. This reflects a trend, not only at Bowdoin College, but in select schools all across the nation, as each student is, on average, applying to more and more colleges. \par In general, students are increasingly taking advantage of the Early Decision option, believing that their chances of admission will increase due to their stronger enthusiasm for the College. However, Bowdoin does not strongly endorse this route, and instead encourages students to \ldblquote take their time when making such an important decision,\rdblquote  according to Richard Steele, vice president of admissions and student aid. \par Though the committee has only just begun the evaluation process, they are already extremely impressed with the potential and talent of the Class of 2005. Steele was especially impressed with the strength of the teacher recommendations, a factor that is weighted especially heavily in the Bowdoin admissions process. \par Candidates are rated in six different categories, and the first factor considered is the student\rquote s essay and personal statement. While most schools require only one essay, Bowdoin places extra emphasis on writing ability and personality reflected through an essay. \par Steele explained that the next part of the application taken into consideration is the teacher recommendation, which provides a glimpse into the student\rquote s approach to learning and their enthusiasm for education. \par The caliber of the school is also factored in, and officers look at what is available to students in terms of advanced placement courses, extracurricular activities, grades, and other aspects. \par Another unique aspect of the admissions process at Bowdoin is that SAT scores are not a mandatory part of the application. While they are helpful tools in gauging a student\rquote s skill level, Steele notes that \ldblquote if [the applicants] don\rquote t have scores, we don\rquote t assume that they were bad, but it just means more detective work and closer scrutiny of the rest of the application.\rdblquote  \par In addition, Bowdoin does not believe in automatically deferring all candidates not admitted in the Early Decision phase, believing that it is \ldblquote not fair to students to string them along if they would be better off at another school,\rdblquote  Steele said.\par He noted that it is too early to draw any conclusions about the class of 2005, but he stated that no two classes are alike, and each contributes to the Bowdoin community in its own way. \par When asked what sets Bowdoin applications apart from others he\rquote s seen in the business, Steele commented on the independent spirit present in the applications. He partly attributed it to the rustic geographic location of Bowdoin, but this cannot be completely responsible for the adventurous nature of the students which is present in their eagerness to travel, to risk low grades for a challenging course, or to simply take up a new sport or activity. \par Steele said that the admissions process, while exciting, can be draining, as it is difficult to say \ldblquote no\rdblquote  to students who are certain they want to attend Bowdoin. However, Steele is comforted by the fact that \ldblquote if they don\rquote t get in here, they will most likely get into another terrific school.\rdblquote   \par By the same token, his favorite part of the review process is learning about the quality of the students. \ldblquote I have done this work since 1962, and I never fail to be excited when I read applications and learn about young people\rquote s talent and their potential for the future.\rdblquote  \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs48 \par \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs48\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 News2{\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Portland to see Amtrak in April}{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \v\f4\cgrid {\tc {\v }{\v\fs76 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Portland to see Amtrak in April}}}{\fs48 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 Belinda J.

The train will also stop at the University of New Hampshire at Durham on weekends and at Old Orchard, Maine, during the summer. In total, the trip from Boston to Portland should take approximately two and a half hours and cost between $30 and $40 round trip.\par When asked about service to Brunswick, Murray said, \ldblquote Plans, which I believe to be realistic, are underway now to make the connection go north\u8230\'c9to Brunswick.\rdblquote  This connection may not come anytime soon, though, as Murray said the goal was to reach Brunswick in April of 2003.\par This is a full year and a half later than a previous estimate. In an article in the November 5, 1999 issue of the }{\i\cf0 Orient}{\cf0 , Murray had estimated that Amtrak service would come to Brunswick as early as late 2001.\par When questioned about the wait for train service into Maine, Murray admitted, \ldblquote There have been a series of delays over the past ten years.\rdblquote \par Brunswick Town Manager Don Gerrish said that one of those delays was in Boston. \ldblquote [Getting train service into Maine] was a problem because of the Big Dig.\rdblquote \par Another question yet to be addressed is that of a Brunswick train station. The lot intended for the station is across the railroad tracks from Shop \lquote n Save, next to the McLellan Building.\par Because of the delay of Amtrak service, though, the town has not made any concrete plans for the construction of the station. \ldblquote We want to plan what we do with an understanding of the time frame,\rdblquote  Gerrish said.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs48 \par \par \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 News3}{\fs28 \par }{\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Chenault \lquote 73 to become first African-American CEO of blue-chip company}{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \v\f4\cgrid {\tc {\v }{\v\fs44 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Chenault \lquote 73 to become first African-American CEO of blue-chip company}}}{\fs48 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 Blakeney Schick}{\b\scaps \par }{\caps\fs16 staff writer}{\fs48 \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\adjustright \f20\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 Kenneth I. Chenault \lquote 73, president of American Express, will be promoted next month to become the first black CEO (Chief Executive Officer) of a blue-chip company listed on the Dow Jones.\par Originally, Chenault had been slated to succeed his boss Harvey Golub at a shareholders\rquote  meeting in the spring of 2001, but in April of 1999 Golub announced his intention to retire at the end of 2000.\par Chenault has been credited as being the key to the recent revitalization of American Express, which he joined in 1981. His contributions to the $19.1 billion company include reducing operating costs of his divisions by $3 billion and creating new alliances, which increased the number of cards offered by the company and thus cultivated new card holders. He was named president of American Express in 1997.\par While at Bowdoin, Chenault was an active member of the African-American Society and graduated }{\i\cf0 magna cum laude}{\cf0  as a history major with honors. After leaving Bowdoin, Chenault earned his law degree from Harvard University in 1976. He has also participated in fund-raising for The Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families in New York City, which is headed by another Bowdoin alumnus, Geoffrey Canada \lquote 74. \par Chenault was awarded an honorary degree by the College in 1996.
