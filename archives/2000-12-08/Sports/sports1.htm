      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dayton Arena echoed with drumbeats, cheers, and chants 
        (some directed at a particular yellow tank top-wearing Colby fan) last 
        Tuesday, as the men's hockey team buried Colby's White Mules in a rousing 
        5-2 defeat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was great to see the school out to support us," 
        Head Coach Terry Meagher said. "It was a fun and wild night, and a big 
        win for Bowdoin College."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five different Bowdoin forwards scored in the matchup, 
        backed by some excellent defense. Junior Brian Shuman received the Peter 
        Schuh trophy, which recognized the game's most valuable player for his 
        first-rate defense. The Schuh is given every year to the Bowdoin/Colby 
        game's MVP.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher cited his two captain's defensive contributions 
        and leadership as well. Captain Colin Robinson '01 stopped some impressive 
        shots, making 18 saves for the win. "Colin was quiet and steady in the 
        goal," Meagher said. "He gave us exactly what we needed."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd clearly appreciated the effort, cheering him 
        along while providing a bit of criticism for J.D. Hadrias, Colby's goalkeeper. 
        "The students are so supportive, and the class they showed in the manner 
        in which they did so was very much appreciated," Meagher said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It was great to see how the Bowdoin tradition works," 
        added first-year Mike O'Neill. "The crowd was really great."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assists from Mike Carosi '02 and Albert Mayer '03, junior 
        Bill Busch started off the Bowdoin scoring with a power play goal five 
        minutes into the first period. Colby's James LaLiberty answered back 13 
        minutes later, beating Robinson for the 1-1 tie. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the break, junior Andy McNerney took a pass from 
        Busch with 16:28 elapsed in the frame. His shot deflected off Hadrias's 
        glove for the game's only second-period goal. Momentum picked up from 
        that point in the game. "We got some goals and the crowd just gets behind 
        you from there," O'Neill said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five minutes into the last frame, senior captain Alex 
        Tatum's slapshot found Mike O'Leary '01 in front for the third Bowdoin 
        goal. Marty Brisebois dished out an assist to fellow first-year O'Neill 
        a minute later, pushing the score to 4-1. Albert Mayer's short-handed 
        goal, off a pass from O'Leary, found its way into the empty net and sealed 
        the deal for Bowdoin with three minutes left to play.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colby managed one final goal with 2:21 remaining in 
        the game, but it wasn't enough to overcome the deficit. In the end, the 
        Bears had fired 33 shots at Hadrias, outpacing Colby's 20 shots. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher was pleased with the matchup's outcome. "We 
        played a very balanced and confident game, and did very well communicating 
        as a team," he said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears went 1-1 last weekend, losing 1-3 to Salem 
        State and defeating Southern Maine by a margin of 5-3. Dave Rush '02 scored 
        Bowdoin's only goal in Friday's loss, and Sean Starke '03 put two goals 
        and an assist on the board in the USM matchup. Robinson made a combined 
        47 saves in both games.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Neill said that beating Colby made up for the Salem 
        State loss. "We struggled over the weekend, but now we're getting back 
        on track," he said. "Hopefully we'll keep it up and get on a roll."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team is 4-2-1 overall, and 4-1-0 in NESCAC, a record 
        good for a first-place tie with Trinity. Adam Mantin '03 is currently 
        tied for 2nd place in NESCAC's goals scored category, and Ryan Seymour 
        '02 is also tied for 4th place in the points category with seven assists 
        on the season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears host the U.S. National Under-18 team tonight 
        at Dayton for an exhibition game. The U-18 squad consists of national-level 
        players, most of whom have committed to Division I schools next year. 
        They took a 3-1 loss to the University of Maine recently, after beating 
        Michigan State. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team seems to be looking forward to tonight's match. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're really excited for the game," Coach Meagher said. 
        "They aren't playing any other New England teams, and it will be a tough 
        level of competition."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll take games like this anytime. In playing a national 
        team such as this, the experience is invaluable. It should be a high-energy 
        game," he added. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears will be competing in the Salem State 
        tournament right after Christmas, and have five games before winter break's 
        end. "The tournament is a great opportunity to play a Boston game, and 
        since we've got a lot of kids from the North Shore, there will be a lot 
        of families and alums there," Meagher said.</p>
