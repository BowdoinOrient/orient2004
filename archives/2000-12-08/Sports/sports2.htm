      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not every day that Bowdoin gets to play against 
        another country. Last Thursday, however, the Bowdoin Squash Team had the 
        privilege to play against the University of Cape Town South Africa.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Cape Town team decided to add Bowdoin 
        at the last minute to its roster of opponents on its North American tour. 
        The Bowdoin women had no idea what to expect about the South Africans' 
        skill level or what kind of a challenge they faced.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It ended up being a very close match, but the Polar 
        Bears managed to pull out on top. The women ultimately beat South Africa 
        3-2, which came down to a tiebreaker in Liz Steffey's match. Dana Betts, 
        Liz Steffey, Merrill Muckerman, Lindy Stanley, and Laura Inkeles were 
        the only Bowdoin women to play, because the University of Cape Town only 
        brought five women. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophomore Merrill Muckerman brought in the first win 
        by beating her opponent in four games. Although Merrill started off a 
        little slow and lost the first game, she ended up getting a lot more aggressive 
        and played some beautiful squash. The next three games were close, but 
        Merrill managed stay on top of her opponent and dominated the court.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior co-captain Liz Steffey gave Bowdoin another win 
        after a nail-biter match. After losing the first two games, Liz started 
        to focus in the third and began playing the squash she is capable of. 
        Liz came back to win the next two games, which meant that they were going 
        the long haul to five games.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both women were tired and the intensity was up in the 
        fifth game. After a lot of great squash and passion, the women were tied 
        8-8 and went into a tiebreaker. At this point, the crowd was on the edge 
        of their seats, going crazy with every point won or lost. Superwoman Liz 
        did not lose her head and pulled out the victory. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other senior co-captain, Dana Betts, conferred Bowdoin 
        its other win to take the match. Dana played smart, aggressive squash 
        and was quick on her feet, which allowed her to control the game, winning 
        3-0. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dana commented, "She was a good player. I had to work 
        really hard to beat her. I am just particularly impressed that this team 
        traveled all the way across the world to play. They are even living in 
        Winnebago's while they tour the Northeast! The whole South African team 
        was really friendly and funny…. and they know how to party." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liz Steffey also said of the match, "It was a really 
        fun experience to play the South Africans. It was an exciting change from 
        our normal matches that count; this was much more casual and fun loving...The 
        match was just as much about the playing as it was about the curiosity 
        surrounding the other team's culture."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the match, the men's and women's teams showed 
        the South Africans how to party American-style to round out the visitors' 
        experiences in the United States. Hopefully, the Bowdoin squad will make 
        it down to South Africa sometime to receive the same favor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's and women's teams play tonight away at Tufts.
