      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many athletes, running is associated with punishment-maybe 
        for being too slow at practice or not having the endurance to perform 
        well throughout the game. So maybe it's a fair statement to say that track 
        athletes must be super tough because their whole sport is considered punishment.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, despite the talent and discipline runners demonstrate-from 
        the explosive speed of the 55m dash to the grueling stamina it takes to 
        finish the 300m run-there is a whole other world that exists during the 
        Indoor Track season: the field events.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Believe it or not, there is much more to the field events 
        than meets the eye. Sure, long jump seems pretty easy, and it even looks 
        like fun to land in a pit of sand. However, it takes a tremendous amount 
        of speed to carry the jumper down the runway, explosive legs to propel 
        her up and forward through the air as well as coordination between the 
        arms and legs to maximize the distance of the jump before the landing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurdles are not the easiest event, either. Think 
        about how hard it must be to sprint as fast as you can with obstacles 
        in your way! There is a certain rhythm to the hurdles that enables the 
        ideal number of strides to be taken between each hurdle, as well as ensure 
        that the appropriate leg will be forward to get over them. There is a 
        definite technique necessary in hurdling that cuts down the time it takes 
        to get over the hurdle and ensure that no mishaps with the hurdles take 
        place. Hurdlers are known for their creative injuries and perilous adventures 
        with the hurdles.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what about the high jump? How easy can it really 
        be for women to powerfully drive their bodies five feet or higher into 
        the air off one foot, arch gracefully over a bar and land into a pit below 
        them? There is a great deal of precision with respect to the number of 
        springing strides taken to approach the bar at a specific speed in order 
        to ensure the optimal position for the penultimate step and final plant 
        to take off.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing seems like one of those events that just about 
        anybody could do. The shot put looks like an oversized softball, but the 
        eight-pound, thirteen-ounce implement would cause serious shoulder and 
        elbow injuries if you attempted to throw it like a softball. Throwing 
        entails much more than upper body strength. A good thrower derives much 
        of her power from strong legs swiftly gliding backwards across the throwing 
        circle, coordinated with a powerful torso and strong upper body to project 
        the implement forward. All of this force is thrown into one swiftly coordinated 
        movement, transferring all of your weight forward without losing footing 
        and risking a foul by losing balance and stepping out of the circle.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people specialize in certain inter-related field 
        events. For instance, a shot putter may also throw the twenty-pound weight 
        during the season, while a long jumper might compete in the triple jump 
        as well. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runners often double up on events in meets, perhaps 
        running the 55m dash as well as the 4x200m relay. Generally speaking, 
        individuals who specialize in the throws do not make the best distance 
        runners while a high jumper may not make the best thrower. This idea is 
        what makes the pentathlon such an amazing event.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pentathlon is an event where individuals must perform 
        the 55m high hurdles, high jump, shot put, long jump, and 800m run. This 
        is a true test of speed, agility, explosiveness, and endurance. Competing 
        in five different events is both mentally taxing and physically draining. 
        It is often difficult to regroup after a poor performance when you know 
        that there are four events left to complete. Even after a solid performance 
        it can be difficult to psych yourself up for each additional event.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a truly unique individual to want to compete 
        under these circumstances, and train for such a variety of events. Only 
        well conditioned athletes with versatile ability can fearlessly run the 
        hurdles, gracefully and flexibly high jump, powerfully throw the shot 
        put, explosively long jump, and have enough energy to race a tough 800m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone is interested in seeing this event, you can 
        catch Julia Febiger '03 and Caitlin Fowkes '03 at Bates today, December 
        8 at 3:00 p.m.., representing the Bowdoin Women's Track Team at the ultimate 
        indoor track challenge. </p>
