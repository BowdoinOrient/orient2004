        semester comes to a close, and like any good funk groove, the Film Society 
        just won't quit. That is why even though classes will be over, we are 
        going to give you one more weekend of quality cinematic enjoyment. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And even though we think it's too "cliché" to even show Citizen 
        Kane, the Film Society is not above showing holiday themed movies in our 
        last weekend before the Christmas season. So come on out for some yuletide 
        fun with a twist. You know the routine: Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall, 
        completely free and open to the public.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I should also mention that in addition to the huge amounts 
        of work we all have, us film kids will be finalizing next semester's schedule 
        this weekend. It should be an interesting spring, as our fearless leader 
        Mike takes off to face the wilds of Spain and the Society gets to use 
        the ambiguous slogan "under new management." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So if you have a suggestion for something we should show 
        (and you didn't get to visit us in the Union last week), find one of us 
        in the next couple of days and let your voice be heard.<br>

        <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> (1993) <br>
        Directed by: Henry Selick <br>
        Starring the voices of: Danny Elfman, Chris Sarandon, Catherine O'Hara, 
        William Hickey, Paul Reubens <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Even though he didn't direct it, Tim Burton's presence is 
        felt throughout this film. He also wrote the original poem, designed the 
        production and produced it. And since this is one of the coolest films 
        ever, he deserves a lot of credit. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The story concerns Halloweentown resident Jack Skellington 
        and the Pumpkin King, who grows tired of running the same holiday year 
        after year. One day he wanders into Christmastown and is inspired to merge 
        Halloween and Christmas into one holiday under his command. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He kidnaps Santa and gets the creatures of Halloweentown to 
        help him make this Christmas one to remember. This is a stop-motion musical, 
        and it is truly mind-blowing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It took over two years to film, and you'll see why. There 
        is so much happening, and it was all done by hand. The songs were written 
        by Oingo-Boingo alum Danny Elfman, who gets to revitalize his singing 
        career by doing all of Jack's songs. This is one of the best animated 
        movies you will ever see; you do not want to miss it. <b>- Rated PG</b>

        <i>Dead</i> <i>Again</i> (1996) <br>
        Directed by: Kenneth Branagh <br>
        Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Andy Garcia, Lois Hall, Wayne 
        Knight <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We've shown some confusing movies this year, but if memory 
        serves me right, this one takes the cake. I haven't seen this movie in 
        years, and the summary I have here in front of me isn't all that helpful, 
        but let me try to tell you what this movie is about (not that any summary 
        of it would make much sense). Branagh plays a detective hired to figure 
        out the identity of a mute woman. In doing so, he discovers information 
        about the past lives of both the woman and himself, and how they intertwined 
        once before. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Throw into the mix some murders, Branagh's sophisticated 
        directorial style, and some highbrow humor, and you've got yourself an 
        enjoyable little film. I don't really remember why we decided to show 
        this movie on our Happy Holidays weekend; maybe there's some crucial plot-piece 
        I am forgetting. I guess we'll find out on Friday night. - <b>Rated</b>

        <i>National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation</i> (1989) <br>
        Directed by: Jeremiah S. Chechik <br>
        Starring: Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Diane Ladd, Julia 
        Louis-Dreyfus, William Hickey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Juliette Lewis <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Griswold family may always be associated with a former 
        member of Steely Dan (maybe that's why this film is known, in some circles, 
        as The Chevy Chase Christmas Special), but the entire family is in full 
        effect for this installment of the Vacation series. Instead of travelling 
        to some far off place, the family comes to the Griswold home, including 
        siblings and two sets of parents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The expected arguments and madness ensue. But don't think 
        it's just the human members of the family who shine, there are some great 
        animal performances, especially from the cat and squirrel. This is one 
        of those Christmas comedy classics that you can enjoy year after year. 
        If you haven't seen it before, now is a great time to start. - <b>Rated 
        R </b></font></p>

        <i>Twelve Angry Men</i> (1957) <br>
        Directed by: Sidney Lumet <br>
        Starring: Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack 
        Klugman, Robert Webber, Ed Begley Sr. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Except for a few moments at the opening of the film, all 
        the action takes place in a tiny jury room. Twelve men face the task of 
        sentencing a young man who seems to be obviously guilty. Fonda plays the 
        voice of reason, who casts the single vote of non-guilty. He then must 
        convince the other jurors to look beyond their pre-conceived notions and 
        prejudices and finally give the defendant a fair shot. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; All the actors are amazing, and the story is very moving. 
        It's a true classic. I've been informed that the 12 men represent the 
        Apostles, which is a good enough reason to include it in this themed weekend.
