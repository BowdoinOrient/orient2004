      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest many of us come to expressing ourselves with 
        our bodies is shaking our collective boody to the sounds of the latest 
        pop beat on any given Saturday night. For some talented students on the 
        Bowdoin campus, however, this form of personal expression takes a role 
        in daily life through classes offered by the department of theater and 
        dance. In the immensely popular annual December Studio Show, dance students 
        will have the chance to show off their moves to packed houses on Thursday 
        and Friday nights. This year the show will make use of the newly-created 
        Wish Theater, providing many opportunities for creative use of lighting 
        and space and giving dancers unique challenges that come with performing 
        in the round.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The show's relocation to Wish will allow for a modified presentation 
        of the dances, adapting it to the innovative space being used. June Vail, 
        chair of the dance department, is excited to be making use of the new 
        theater for the show: "This is our first opportunity to use the flexible 
        space in the new Wish Theater, so we've chosen to present multiple, more 
        intimate shows rather than a larger one in Pickard Theater."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of the show itself, Vail spoke of its place in campus life: 
        "The December Studio Show has a long history at Bowdoin. It's an informal 
        show in which dances and works in progress from classes, independent studies 
        and co-curricular groups can be presented with a little background introduction 
        from the department…There's a very wide spectrum of dance and music styles 
        represented, from contemporary dance to tap, ballet, jazz, hip-hop, step, 
        and zany dance/theater."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The dances are a sampling of student work from a wide variety 
        of ability levels as well as genres, giving the audience an idea of how 
        dancers develop skills and learn movement. The show opens up with a dance 
        by the members of Dance 312, entitled "Glass" and choreographed by Paul 
        Sarvis of the dance department and the dancers. Set to ethereal music 
        by American composer Lou Harrison, the dancers in "Glass" explore, as 
        the program states, "a land of contrasts where time is subjective, and 
        their physical dramas are alternately grand and subtle." A highlight of 
        the 7 p.m. show comes next, with sophomore Julie Dawson's original work 
        "Calling," a solo piece set to a solid beat by the group Dead Can Dance. 
        In the 9 p.m. show, an interpretation of the wonderful song "Walking in 
        Memphis" by Marc Cohn is given through the medium of ballet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The diversity in dances can be seen in the a cappella number 
        performed by the Tap Club, who truly take advantage of the space inside 
        Wish through the use of every level of the theater. An upbeat piece for 
        the choreography class, Making Dances uses folding chairs in every conceivable 
        fashion in "Rusted Chairs," to the tune of the always popular "Send Me 
        On My Way" by Rusted Root. The next dance, entitled "Rush" and choreographed 
        by Gwyneth Jones and the dancers of Dance 212, is a high-energy and challenging 
        number set to highly rhythmic music.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The student group VAGUE is also making its mark at the Studio 
        Show with its to-be-envied moves set to Jordan Knight's "Give It To You," 
        and, in their first appearance, the Bowdoin step team Unity will take 
        the stage. Finally, Dance 112 presents a spirited multimedia piece that 
        will have the audience wanting to skip home wrapped in tablecloths…you'll 
        have to get the details on that one yourself.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the December Studio Show is a many-dimensioned 
        work of myriad styles and forms. Performers such as Aurelia Hall '02 are 
        excited to be presenting the culmination of their studies and hard work: 
        "Dancing in an experimental theater forces you to stretch your imagination; 
        there are so many options in Wish! I especially love how the tap group 
        takes advantage of the various levels of the theater. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm performing with VAGUE…This semester VAGUE has focused 
        most of its attention on the mainstream Pop and R&B music/dance world 
        of entertainment. The show as a whole is a highlight!" At last report 
        tickets were sold out for the 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. shows this Thursday and 
        Friday, but scalpers have been known to lurk around the theater. The Studio 
        Show promises to be a great way to end the semester as well as a fun way 
        to pick up some new moves for those Saturday nights.</p>
