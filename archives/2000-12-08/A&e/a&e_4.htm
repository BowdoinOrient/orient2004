      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stepped into Movie Gallery, I felt like a guilty husband 
        who was about to have an affair. In my four years here at Bowdoin, I have 
        patronized Video Galaxy (formerly Matt and Dave's Video Venture) with 
        absolute devotion. Unfortunately, Video Galaxy could not meet my needs 
        this week, so I had to stray and surrender myself to the services of another 
        video rental store.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You must be wondering what caused me to commit such an adulterous 
        act. As I explained to the store clerk while I was signing the Movie Gallery 
        membership contract, "Understand something, I am doing this solely because 
        you have this movie and Video Galaxy does not." I proudly waved a copy 
        of My 5 Wives in the clerk's face.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The film in question stars Rodney Dangerfield and Andrew 
        Dice Clay. But wait, it gets better. Rodney Dangerfield plays a land developer 
        who buys a plot of land in Utah, and little does he know, it comes with 
        three beautiful Mormon wives (he later marries two more because the other 
        three can't cook). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Comedy and mad?cap antics ensue. Sheer genius, no? I must 
        admit, I did not find out about this little gem all my own. An enormous 
        thank you goes out to Craig Jewell and Nate Anderson for passing on the 
        word about this cinematic masterpiece.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to Comedy Central, and their perpetual broadcasting 
        of Back to School, Rodney Dangerfield will never be forgotten. With My 
        5 Wives, Dangerfield proves that he is still just as fine a comedic thespian 
        as ever. The video opens with a stream of Dangerfield's most choice material. 
        "I go fishing, I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dangerfield plays Monte Peterson, a successful land developer 
        in Los Angeles. "And there's the new office building I erected. I also 
        erected a new sports complex. I erected a downtown library." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Can you see where this joke is going? In case not, I'll give 
        you the punch line, "I got erections all over this town." Now that's Dangerfield 
        at his best.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Monte is getting a divorce from his most recent beautiful 
        wife, who only wanted him for his money. "This woman married my client 
        under false pretenses," announces Monte's lawyer at the divorce hearing. 
        "Yeah, her chest," Monte adds.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After the hearing, Monte flies out to Redwood Springs, Utah, 
        a Mormon town where he plans on buying a plot of land to construct a ski 
        resort. The town's motto is "Love thy neighbor as thyself." "What am I 
        supposed to do, jerk him off too?" Ohoohh! Now this joke is funny because 
        Dangerfield loves himself by masturbating, and if he were to love his 
        neighbor as he does himself, well he would have to manually masturbate 
        his neighbor as well.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Monte outbids an evil and corrupt banker at the auction for 
        the land he wants. As he is signing the deed, the town clergymen reveal 
        to him that he will have to marry the three women that come with the land, 
        who were all part of the former owner's "property." Upon seeing the stunningly 
        gorgeous young ladies, Virginia, Stephanie, and Emily, Monte immediately 
        agrees to wed them. Of course he has a separate ceremony for each girl 
        he marries.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "My wives are killing me, all they want is sex, sex, sex," 
        Monte complains. "God gave me two of everything, two eyes, two hands.... 
        The only thing I need two of, God gave me one." He's talking about his 
        penis. If he had multiple penises he wouldn't be so tired from sex. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So what does Monte do about his problem? He goes out and 
        buys one of those red deli?counter ticket dispensers so his wives can 
        take a number, and wait their turn for sex. Monte takes his wives to the 
        town fair, where Virginia enters a kumquat pie in the annual bake?off. 
        The judge winces as he tastes it and says, "I think it needs less kum 
        and more quat." This is funny because... never mind:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The plot thickens when one of the town residents dies, and 
        his property and two wives go up for bid. To prevent the evil banker from 
        getting the land, Monte buys it and marries the two girls, Meagan and 
        Sarah. Monte takes his five wives to Las Vegas, where they play tennis 
        and he buys them skimpy bikinis. While in Vegas, his wives become liberated 
        and exposed to feminist ideals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Upon returning to Redwood Springs, the girls buy power?suits 
        and get highpaying jobs, leaving Monte at home to do the cooking and cleaning. 
        My, how the tables have turned. In spite of a distracting sub?plot involving 
        Andrew Dice Clay as a mobster who wants to "whack" Monte because he keeps 
        buying the land he wants so "the family" can build a casino in Mormon 
        country, My 5 Wives pays off big when it comes to laughs. <b>A++++</b></p>
