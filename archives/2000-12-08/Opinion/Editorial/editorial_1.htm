      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's that time again-time to fill out professor evaluations 
        that, according to the College, are used in part to determine which professors 
        are tenured. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is a time when students feel like they can make a positive 
        contribution to the future of the College. It is a time when many students 
        who have had wonderful experiences with professors can actively express 
        their desire to have their favorite professors tenured. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;That's why many of us came to a liberal arts college: we want 
        to be taught by professors who love teaching, inspire students, and receive 
        "rave reviews" on professor evaluations. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As much as students may praise professors in the evaluations, 
        some professors still stay for a year or two and then leave. There are 
        some professors who are not tenure- track but are only visiting professors. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We understand the need to have fluidity in an academic department, 
        and this may necessitate hiring a visiting professor to fill a vacancy 
        when there is not time to engage in a full tenure-track search. Having 
        professors who rotate through Bowdoin gives students the opportunity to 
        take different classes that may be the speciality of a professor and would 
        not be available to them otherwise. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But at the same time, having too many professors rotate through 
        Bowdoin has its downfalls. Aside from making it very difficult to get 
        recommendations for graduate school from a professor who has left Bowdoin, 
        students do not have the same opportunity to foster relationships with 
        visiting professors as they have with professors who they can interact 
        with for several years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of these purely selfish reasons for wanting to 
        keep some professors around, we believe that Bowdoin also suffers a general 
        loss when some great visiting professors leave simply because they have 
        fulfilled the term that they were originally hired for. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When such a professor is given wonderful reviews from his 
        or her students and inspires students to major in the field, then that 
        professor should be given serious consideration for a tenure position, 
        even if that was not the original intention. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While the research abilities of professors are important, 
        students are not fighting to get into the class with the professor who 
        wrote a book last year. They are fighting to get into the class with the 
        professors who engage the class-the professors who inspire them. And we 
        tell you who these professors are. </p>
