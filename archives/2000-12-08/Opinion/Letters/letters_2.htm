      <p>To the Bowdoin Community</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As one directly involved with the recent cutting and pruning 
        of the Bowdoin Pines along Bath Road, I feel compelled to explain the 
        reason for the undertaking of this project. The Town of Brunswick, and 
        especially the Bowdoin College community, is very protective of their 
        magnificent stand of white pines. I believe the Bowdoin Pines are unique 
        to populated New England-and therein lies the problem.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Brunswick and Bowdoin College are stewards of these pines, 
        and in a loose sense, responsible for the safety of those passing through. 
        Many of the Bowdoin Pines are over-mature, and several hazard trees were 
        identified by Brunswick's arborist, Peter Baecher. Two pine trees along 
        Bath Road were dead and the others in various stages of decay. Their direction 
        of lean was also taken into account. As a result, eight pines and two 
        smaller hemlocks were slated for removal. Much thought was given to each 
        of these trees, as Peter did not take this task lightly. Relying on 25 
        years of experience, I concurred with Peter's decision, and judged several 
        of these trees to be an immediate safety hazard.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; At the present age of this forest, trees with rotted trunks 
        may fall during high winds or ice storms. Several pines on the north side 
        of Bath Road have fallen recently, and fortunately, not towards the road. 
        Our job as arborists is to make your passage through the Bowdoin Pines 
        as safe as possible, while respecting the gift nature has given us. It 
        is a tough balancing act.</p>
