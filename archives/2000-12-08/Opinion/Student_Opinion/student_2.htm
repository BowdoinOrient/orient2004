      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; December is a dangerous month. It's not the ice that's beginning 
        to encroach upon our walkways, nor is it the early darkness that hides 
        pedestrians ambling across roadways that emits peril, nor the bitter wind 
        that whips across the quad. In fact, December is not dangerous for anything 
        that its winter background dictates. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is the very spirit that embodies and livens the 
        month that will prove the pitfall for many of us in the upcoming weeks. 
        It is the excitement of the upcoming holidays that we willingly put ourselves 
        in the way of physical harm in every attempt to capture the holiday spirit. 
        Reflect a moment upon all the times you have hung holiday decorations. 
        Reflect again on how many of those times you nearly killed yourself. There 
        is no other point in the year when Americans are willing to put themselves 
        in harm's way more than they will for the holidays.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But that's a very serious introduction for a very laughable 
        matter, as my experiences with holiday decorations are very similar to 
        those of Clark Griswald. Decorating at my house was always an ordeal. 
        Without fail my father would have a master plan to decorate the house, 
        a plan that always ultimately failed, as the outside lights never had 
        a theme, or a color scheme. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It was the outside decorating that almost always cost us 
        our lives-a fact that I was reminded of when I called home this past Sunday. 
        As the story was told, my father was once again performing his annual 
        duty of decorating the exterior. A twelve-foot stepladder under foot, 
        a ball of lights in hand, and my unassuming brother anxiously holding 
        the bottom of the ladder, he attempted to hang lights along the gutter. 
        But in true holiday spirit, all common sense had been lost. When his reach 
        could get him no farther along the gutter, he decided to step onto the 
        wrong side of the ladder to get that extra foot-you know the side, where 
        the rungs are as strong as dowels and a sign explicitly warns of impending 
        injury. Well, the holidays apparently erased this warning. Ignoring my 
        brother's caveat, my father stepped onto the other side-and down he went-dowel 
        by dowel-to the frozen ground. And down came the ladder, crumpling in 
        two upon him. But all was well-besides some lost pride and a sore back, 
        the venture was successful-as not a single light broke. After all, that's 
        the most important thing when decorating: never, ever break a bulb. No 
        matter what.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You'd think that an upbringing characterized by dangerous 
        endeavors during December would knock some sense into me now. But, of 
        course, it hasn't. This past week, we at Quinby were decorating, mind 
        you with our common sense somehow stolen by the ghost of Christmas past. 
        We carelessly hung lights outside in the dark with pushpins-aiming right 
        for the wires. I was just waiting for the shock. And then there were thoughts 
        of decorating the roof-ice and all. "It's not that steep" some of us declared. 
        "I've been on ice more slippery than that." Really? I didn't think there 
        were degrees of slipperiness. But our roof isn't decorated, and it's not 
        because it's too dangerous-we just ran out of time. Damn finals. But I 
        too partook in my yearly adventure of decorating. Hanging out windows, 
        precariously clutching to a windowsill, fingers freezing, and the ground 
        begging for my fall, I helped hang lights. In fact, I'm surprised no one 
        killed themselves here. But then again, it's only December 8. There is 
        plenty more decorating to be done for the holidays. </p>
