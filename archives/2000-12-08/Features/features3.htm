      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the biggest mistake a friend can make is to 
        ask me a question about any automotive topic. Seriously, once asked, I 
        will not shut up. So, in the spirit of the "common good," I've decided 
        to get the car bug out of my system and to provide anyone fortunate enough 
        to pick up this week's Orient with the general basics on cars.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Back in my senior year of high school, I replaced my '86 
        Escort (a horror story if ever there was one) with a shiny '76 Mustang. 
        Let me say this: if ever you want a crash course in basic car repair, 
        buy a vehicle older than you are. When stuff gets old, it just breaks-weird 
        stuff, stuff you'd never even think of. Here are some things I've learned 
        through the years: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Whatcha Got in There</i>?: On occasion, I've been surprised 
        when I've asked a few friends of mine what type of engines their cars 
        have-few have any idea. This is useful knowledge, folks. The first thing 
        an auto parts store clerk asks you is what the year, model, and engine 
        type of your car are. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I can't help but think that a devious mechanic 
        might instinctively think "sucker" when he meets somebody that can't answer 
        this question. Basically, check your owner's manual. If you can't figure 
        it out, look under the hood. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What is that big thing with all of the hoses coming out of 
        it? That is your engine, folks. What type is it? Basically, engines are 
        categorized by their number of cylinders: usually four, six, or eight, 
        unless you're lucky enough to own a Viper. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To count cylinders easily, look for spark plugs. These 
        are identified by the big fat wires that attach to them. There's one plug 
        per cylinder, so this is sort of a gimme. If they are all in a single 
        row, this is a "straight" engine, i.e. a "straight six" or a "straight 
        eight." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your engine has a single row of four cylinders but 
        those cylinders run sideways, from left to right, rather than front to 
        back, this is a "transverse mounted four." This seems trivial, but a lot 
        of compact cars have these, maybe even yours. What is a "V-6" or a "V-8?" 
        In this set up, the cylinders are in two parallel rows slanted toward 
        one another; hence, you either have two rows of four, or two rows of three.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uncle Buck Syndrome</i>: When you start up your car, 
        do you ever worry that anybody standing to the rear of your vehicle might 
        get carbon monoxide poisoning? If your car is kicking out too much exhaust, 
        any number of things might be wrong. First, make sure that you are not, 
        in fact, driving a steam locomotive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No? Well, if there is a blue haze that puffs out of 
        your tailpipe when you start your car, this is burning oil. This is common 
        when a car reaches its golden era: nothing to worry about really, it's 
        just that, while the car sits, oil seeps into where it shouldn't, and 
        when starting, it burns the oil off. Your engine is aging, and rings and 
        gaskets aren't what they used to be. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your car puffs blue smoke all the time, get to a 
        mechanic and prepare either for a new car or for some expensive maintenance; 
        cars run on gasoline, not 10-W30. If your car is smoking too much, and 
        the smoke isn't blue, and you have a lot of black soot in your tailpipe, 
        see a mechanic. Chances are your fuel mixture is off (the triangle of 
        combustion: air, fuel, and heat).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much gas is running "rich," too much air is running 
        "lean." On my old, carborated car, I can tinker with this. As your car 
        is probably fuel-injected, don't touch anything. Who knows, maybe you'll 
        save some gas money?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>What's That Noise</i>?: Again, if you aren't sure, 
        see a mechanic. Still, some basics.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Screeching every time you start the car and punch on 
        the gas means you have a loose belt. This is very easy to fix. Basically, 
        tighten the belt. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most cars have flywheels (what the belts attach to) 
        that are on little pivots and slots. You can loosen a couple screws, pry 
        the flywheel as far out as you can so that the belt is tight, and tighten 
        the screws again. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine if a belt is loose, I have personally 
        developed a very scientific analysis known as the "wiggle test"-try it 
        if you dare. If that doesn't work, get a new belt-they're cheap. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the car makes a groaning/grumbling/creaking noise 
        when it comes to a stop, check your brake pads and rotors! Most likely, 
        you'll want to see a professional (if you could do it yourself, you wouldn't 
        be reading this anyway). Brakes are very important if you like being able 
        to stop your car. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, when you turn your wheel over hard, especially 
        when going slow, there's this rasping or rubbing noise, it could mean 
        several things. Maybe your wheel is rubbing something. Maybe it's your 
        power steering fluid. Maybe your power steering pump is on its last leg. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, check the fluid and fill 'er up if she's low. 
        If you still have a problem, see a mechanic. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there's a "tick-a-tick-a-tick-a" noise whenever 
        your engine is on, particularly when you punch the gas, most likely, your 
        lifters are clicking. Check your oil! This noise is a bad sign. If you 
        add oil and it's still clicking away, see a mechanic. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a good time to mention that one should never 
        wait until the red oil warning light comes on to check one's oil. If the 
        light is burned out, or if there's a problem with the sensor, you could 
        drive for hundreds, maybe thousands of miles with your engine parts grating 
        and chewing against each other?this could kill your car!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that someday this will save somebody here some 
        trouble. Maybe it will get you to a friend's wedding, maybe it will make 
        sure that your car doesn't die in a blizzard-who knows? Still, even if 
        this article doesn't change your life, don't you feel handy? I thought 
        so.<br>
