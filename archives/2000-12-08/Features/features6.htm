      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth year of the Civil War saw the Confederacy 
        slowly dying. In the West, Vicksburg had fallen, opening the Mississippi 
        to Union ships. At Chattanooga, Ulysses S. Grant had all but destroyed 
        the major Confederate army in the west, and at sea, the Union blockade 
        was choking the rebellion's supplies from across the Atlantic. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Only in the east was there a problem. After four bloody years 
        of advance and retreat, the Union Army of the Potomac had still been unable 
        to end the career of Robert E. Lee and his legendary Army of Northern 
        Virginia.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Sam Grant went east to deal with Lee in early 1864, 
        plans for an offensive in the west were underway.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the first major battle at Bull Run in 1861, Oliver 
        Howard had been a part of the Civil War. But his rise in the east had 
        been halted by the disaster at Chancellorsville and at Gettysburg. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent west to help relieve Chattanooga, Howard finally 
        escaped the command of the luckless eastern generals: Bad Luck McDowell, 
        Gutless McClellan, Brainless Burnside, All-Talk Hooker, and most recently 
        Bad-Tempered Meade. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now he was under the command of a man who loved to 
        talk, fight and smoke cigars. Having shared the battlefield at Bull Run 
        with Howard, William Tecumseh Sherman certainly had heard of the general 
        from Maine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter 1863 saw rest and refit for the Union armies. 
        Howard himself received thanks from Sherman for helping out with the relief 
        of Knoxville. Sherman called Howard a "polished Christian gentleman" and 
        a "prompt, zealous,…gallant soldier." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High praise indeed from a man who knew good fighters 
        when he saw them. After placing his men in winter quarters, Howard had 
        a chance to return to Maine for a quick visit with his family. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he returned at the beginning of the year he found 
        that his friends in high places had been at work on his behalf again. 
        Congress had just voted to give thanks to Howard for his role in the Battle 
        of Gettysburg. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Included in the congressional thanks were also the 
        names of Joe Hooker and George Meade. Thus the document was strange in 
        that Hooker's name was attached-he wasn't even at Gettysburg-and that 
        General Winfield Scott Hancock-arguably the savior of Gettysburg-was not 
        mentioned. (The author wishes to include that he is partially biased since 
        he is a big fan of General Hancock.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Congressional thanks sparked controversy down the 
        years between Howard and Hancock supporters. Certainly Howard himself 
        was concerned about the document. He was troubled on a spiritual level 
        since the controversy would affect his image as a Christian soldier. Whatever 
        his inner turmoil, all around him things were moving fast.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Spring 1864 Union Offensive was simple; Grant would 
        attack Lee, and Sherman would attack Joseph Johnston's Confederate army 
        on his way to Atlanta, the heart of the Confederacy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sherman worked fast in getting his men in order. At 
        the start of the campaign, he would have close to 1,100,000 men in three 
        armies: The Army of the Cumberland under General George H. Thomas, The 
        Army of the Tennessee under General James McPherson, and The Army of the 
        Ohio under General John Schofield. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reorganizing his commands, Sherman combined Howard's 
        Eleventh and Henry Slocum's Twelfth Corps to form the Twentieth Corps 
        under General Joe Hooker. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Howard was given a new corps to command. The Mainer went 
        from commanding German immigrants to hard-fighting Western veterans from 
        the Fourth Army Corps. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman's men trained not just in military drill but 
        also in repairing the vital railroad, which would be the supply line for 
        the armies once the campaign began. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But certainly the energetic Sherman did not spend all his 
        days working. Taking time off from his daily tasks, Sherman and a division 
        commander, General Jefferson C. Davis, once made fun of Howard's religious 
        dispositions by having a swearing marathon in front of him. Howard left, 
        opening Sherman to comment on his lack of humor!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Atlanta Campaign opened on May 4, coinciding with Grant's 
        attack on Lee's lines in Virginia. The Confederates under Joe Johnston 
        awaited the Federals at a steep, twenty-mile long ridge called Rocky Face 
        Ridge.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studying the position and finding it not practical to 
        attack, Sherman adopted a plan by George Thomas; he would feint with two 
        armies and send one circling around to get at the rebel rear near the 
        town of Resaca.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement went fine, but the arrival of rebel reinforcements 
        forced the plan to fail in the end. Sherman, knowing that the game was 
        up, moved his entire force, minus Howard and some cavalry, to Resaca via 
        a gap in Rock Face. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the rebels withdrew from his front, Howard pursued 
        and approached Resaca from the north while attempting to link up with 
        the rest of the Union troops, now on his right. His force being small, 
        the rebels attacked Howard on May 14 but retreated once Howard called 
        up reinforcements. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman attacked Johnston, and finding that the rebel 
        position was too strong, swung wide around the Confederate flank to threaten 
        their supply line. Johnston retreated slowly and sat waiting for Sherman 
        at a place called Cassville. There he planned to attack and cripple a 
        third of the Federal forces before they could concentrate. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attack was not sprung due to the arrival of some 
        lost Federal troops in the rebel rear. Johnston gave ground again, backing 
        away to Allatoona Pass. Sherman's movements had been swift, and his advance 
        had been remarkable compared to the situation in the east at the same 
        time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within eleven days, Sherman was almost halfway to his 
        objective in Atlanta. His soldiers were happy since their supplies were 
        also moving as fast. "The rapidity with which the badly broken railroad 
        was repaired seemed miraculous," Howard wrote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his supplies at maximum, Sherman could afford to 
        leave the railroad for a couple of days, which is what he did when he 
        cut loose and marched beyond Johnston's left flank to land his force around 
        a town called Dallas. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 27, Howard was ordered to attack the rebel right 
        near Pickett's Mill. Due to some poor scouting, Howard did not strike 
        the end of the rebel line as he had intended, but rather ran headlong 
        into Confederate General Patrick Cleburne's division-the very best men 
        the rebels had. Howard was bloodily and swiftly repulsed, leaving him 
        with 1500 casualties. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the rains began, and for seventeen days, the downpour 
        did not end. The Union men became demoralized in the mud that soon swamped 
        them. The June rains were "the hardest times the army experienced," Howard 
        later commented. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman shifted his armies and brought them again astride 
        the Western & Atlantic Railroad, where supplies were collected. By now 
        Sherman was beginning to feel agitated. He had long been from the school 
        of "come on out and lets fight to the death" warfare. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe Johnston, unfortunately, did not want to play Sherman's 
        game. Thinking that his men were getting weak from the constant marching, 
        Sherman declared that an all attack was probably necessary. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, he scouted the rebel positions at Pine 
        Mountain. There, on June 14, Joe Johnston and two of his commanders-General 
        William Hardee and General Leonidas Polk, a West Pointer and a bishop 
        turned general-met to observe the Federals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman also observed them and turned to Howard, who 
        was in command of the line at that point. He told Howard to send some 
        artillery shells over to scare them off. Howard sent word to his gunners 
        who were already in action. With just two shots from Battery I of the 
        1st Ohio Light Artillery, the high command of the rebel army was changed 
        forever. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polk lay dead on the field; drawing tears from both 
        Johnston and Hardee while Sherman, upon hearing of the death, jubilantly 
        reported it to Washington and became more determined than ever to attack 
        the rebel line.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnston withdrew his troops from Pine Mountain and 
        waited for Sherman at Kennesaw Mountain.<br>
