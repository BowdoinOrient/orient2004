      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does the date December 12 mean to you? Some of 
        you might flip open your little black agenda books and find that it signifies 
        the last day in a row that is neatly framed with the pink highlighter 
        you decided to use to designate "Reading Week," which comes right before 
        the neat transition into the use of the green highlighter border that 
        signifies "exam period," which is followed by an explosion of metallic 
        silver-pen snowflakes surrounding a swirly-lettered "December Break, Hooray!" 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you whose little black agenda books have 
        become the thing in the bottom of your bag that questionable trash sticks 
        to, December 12 will likely involve sitting in a dimly lit desk in H&L, 
        stubbornly trying to decipher notes from early October through drool smears 
        and doodles of your professor as a giant Mr. Coffee Maker. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if the words "little," "black," and "book" only 
        conjure up a brilliant Heidi Fleiss joke you heard once, well, you'll 
        likely be coming to the tail end of the gauntlet of partying destined 
        to turn "reading week" into "reading-seventeen-minutes-before-the-exam." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever possibilities December 12 might hold for you, 
        there is one man in America for whom December 12 is very important. It 
        is on December 12 that the states must pick their electors, and it is 
        by this rapidly approaching deadline that Vice President Al Gore must 
        somehow theoretically both win a Florida Supreme Court appeal and count 
        a daunting number of ballots.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be any fear that the political 
        cliffhanger leading up to this date will severely distract from the pursuit 
        of Bowdoin students' various reading week activities. And it's not that 
        they are apathetic or don't care, or even that they are particularly bored 
        with the affair. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just that most students seemed to have accepted 
        that Bush is going to be the next president, relegating Gore's desperate 
        attempts to the realm of ignorable sideshow spectacle. For much of the 
        nation, the deciding moment came when the United States Supreme Court 
        ruled in favor of the Bush campaign on Monday.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under one of the harshest public spotlights in recent 
        memory, the Court did everything right, with each aspect of the proceeding 
        providing a refreshing contrast to the antics which had characterized 
        the campaign and election so far. The Court released audiotapes, giving 
        the proceedings an open and inclusive feel, while simultaneously maintaining 
        the Court's mystique. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as off-putting as solemnity of the judges' red 
        velvet curtains and oak-lined private chambers might be, they were a relief 
        after a campaign that gleefully exposed every gold star and pimple the 
        candidates had ever produced. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They ruled at near light-speed in "Supreme Court" time, 
        and no mention need really be made of how long this election has felt 
        in comparison. Most importantly, the Court avoided falling into one of 
        its typical 5-4 voting patterns, which would have only served to mirror 
        the narrow divisions and petty squabbling present in both the presidential 
        and congressional elections. Instead they issued an unsigned opinion as 
        a single, just, judicial organism, and even refused to interfere with 
        the autonomy of the state of Florida any more than they absolutely had 
        to. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone, from compassionate conservatives to flag-patterned, 
        bra-burning liberals, from the Rockefellers to the rock-bottomers, from 
        the soccer moms to the soccer balls, could take some comfort and invest 
        confidence in the Court's exquisite non-decision.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But wait!" you might be thinking right now, "I thought 
        Gore's support was stronger than ever. Why, there has been new evidence 
        that Gore will eventually be able to claim a victory in Florida of tens 
        of thousands of votes." And, "Isn't this the first time throughout the 
        campaign when the Democrats have displayed such solidarity?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well the truth is that this display is mostly a strategy 
        based on the assumption that Bush will be elected the next president. 
        For several reasons, a Bush victory has come to be seen as fairly appealing 
        among many of even the most loyal Democrats. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, it would obviously end this tiresome 
        game of tug-o-Florida. Second, the events of the last month have made 
        Bush's willingness to "reach across the aisles" and compromise with Democrats 
        an all the more essential component of legitimizing his own presidency. 
        Gore's tendency to want to have a hand in every aspect of his sprawling 
        job might have struck some as a more presidential response to governing 
        than Bush's plan to surrounding himself with brilliant people. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But coupled with the disgust at the extraordinary measures 
        already undertaken in pursuit of this presidency, this attitude would 
        likely bring his presidency to an almost complete standstill with the 
        Republican dominated congress. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue which inspired the most passion and fear 
        in Bowdoin students throughout the election was certainly that of the 
        US Supreme Court nominations, which seem to be in the hands of the next 
        president. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely that the compromising spirit inspired 
        by the electoral contest will spill over from other areas into this one 
        as well. Bush knows he cant afford to appear to be responsible for the 
        repeal of Roe v. Wade, at least not if he wants himself or his party to 
        have any hope of maintaining control after these four years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gore's people, however, are banking on the combination 
        of a looming recession and the martyr currency of Gore dramatically winning 
        Florida in post-electoral college recounts. For now, Gore is being pressured 
        to continue by the very unified Democratic supporters who ultimately know 
        and hope that Bush will win. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind of a hard place to be for a vice-president, even 
        if it is only for another four days. So wherever you are, whoever you 
        are, take a moment out on December 12 for Gore, and if you're really quiet, 
        you'll probably be able to hear his trademark sigh all the way here in 
        Brunswick. Only this time it will be in relief. </p>
