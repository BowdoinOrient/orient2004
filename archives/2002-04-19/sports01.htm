      <p>Casey Kelley '02 and Nick Lyford '02 both graduated from Narraguagus 
        High School and enrolled at Bowdoin College in the fall of 1998. Each 
        has gone on to be elected team captains, and this past Saturday they each 
        broke school records in their track specialties. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Narraguagus is my favorite high school,&quot; observed Bowdoin 
        Coach Peter Slovenski. &quot;Everyone on our team from Narraguagus broke 
        a school record last weekend.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kelley and Lyford already held school records in the women's triple jump 
        and men's javelin, but each broke their own record and took first place 
        in a meet on Saturday involving six teams at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I knew Casey would be a standout in college athletics,&quot; recalled 
        Slovenski. &quot;She had been a Class C state champion in the triple jump 
        and hurdles, and had a lot of motivation for track. Casey was the top 
        recruit of the year. But Nick has been a great surprise. &quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Lyford contacted Bowdoin coaches about sports, but he contacted the basketball 
        coach first. Nick was a Downeast Athletic Conference and State of Maine 
        McDonald's all-star basketball player his senior year at Narraguagus, 
        averaging 12 points and 13 rebounds a game. </p>
      <p>&quot;Basketball was my first love in high school,&quot; admitted Lyford. 
        &quot;When I visited Bowdoin, I wanted to play college basketball in the 
        winter, and then maybe do track in the spring.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nick had some success in high school track. He threw the high school 
        javelin 157' and scored in the Class C high jump with a jump of 6'. But 
        Nick was not convinced there would be much more track and field in his 
        future. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;He told me he wanted to play varsity basketball,&quot; Coach Slovenski 
        remembered, &quot;and he also said he liked to ski. I figured between 
        basketball and skiing we'd never see this guy on a college track team.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Nick didn't work very hard at track in high school,&quot; Casey 
        Kelley recalled. &quot;He used to hide in the back of a pick-up truck 
        just to get out of running intervals.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>But this past weekend Nick set a new college record in the javelin with 
        a throw of 189'10&quot;. Lyford has been a two-time All-New England selection 
        in the javelin, and this past winter won the shot put in the collegiate 
        state meet. His track accomplishments have been the result of his outstanding 
        natural talent and a new found work ethic that has impressed his teammates 
        enough to elect him captain of the 55 member squad. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;You need to work a lot harder to be successful in college track,&quot; 
        observed Lyford. &quot;Every college team has some guys who were state 
        champions in high school, so I had to start putting in the work if I wanted 
        to be competitive at this level.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>And both Casey and Nick have become very competitive All-New England 
        track and field athletes at Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;During their freshman year, Casey was always on time for practice, 
        and Nick was often missing,&quot; said Coach Slovenski. &quot;Casey told 
        me to look for him in the back of pick-up trucks. He had a lot of excuses 
        for not being at practice. But now he is one of the most dedicated athletes 
        on the team, as well as one of the best students. This semester Nick is 
        completing an honors project in physics.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Women's team captain Kelley has had an outstanding four year career for 
        the Polar Bears. &quot;Casey has been a team leader and one of our top 
        scorers ever since her first season,&quot; noted Slovenski. &quot;She 
        was competitive in the college championship meets right away, and she 
        has improved her performance each year through hard work.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kelley was high scorer for Bowdoin this past winter with 88 points and 
        broke her own school record in the triple jump this past weekend with 
        a leap of 36'10&quot;. In the same meet Kelley also won the hurdles (16.20) 
        and the javelin (121') <br>
      </p>
      <p>Kelley and Lyford have been good friends through high school and college 
        and also good rivals. Kelley is an anthropology major and math minor. 
        Lyford is a physics major, and Kelley enjoys reminding him about high 
        school physics. &quot;I got a higher grade in physics than he did,&quot; 
        she says with a smile.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It has taken Lyford a bit longer, but now he has caught up to Kelley 
        in physics and track. &quot;They've made terrific contributions to Bowdoin 
        as students, athletes, and leaders,&quot; noted Slovenski. &quot;The Narraguagus 
        connection has been great for Bowdoin College.&quot; </p>
