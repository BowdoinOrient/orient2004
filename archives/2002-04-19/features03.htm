      <p> After Confederate general Robert E. Lee surrendered his forces at Appomattox 
        in April of 1865, Thomas Worchester Hyde, of the Bowdoin class of 1861, 
        a veteran of nearly every eastern battle of the Civil War and a brigade 
        commander at the age of 24, marched his troops to the aid of Union general 
        William Tecumseh Sherman, who was still battling rebel troops under rebel 
        Joseph Johnston in North Carolina. Before he got there, however, Johnston 
        surrendered. Hyde, at that time in the vicinity of Danville, Virginia, 
        was made military governor of the place and the surrounding counties until 
        the 16th of May. After this brief interlude Hyde marched his men back 
        to Washington. On the way, he noted that:<br>

      <p>The peaceful march to Washington over familiar war-worn ground seemed 
        very queer. There was no firing or [sic] the picket line at night. We 
        were all becoming impressed with the problem of what we were going to 
        do when we got home.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Before that problem had to be faced, Hyde and the Sixth Corps troops 
        got their own grand review in Washington, having missed the first &quot;Grand 
        Review.&quot; After that the men went their separate ways and Tom Hyde's 
        adventure in the American Civil War came to a close. But meanwhile the 
        Civil War was still raging for the members of the United States Senate. 
        The questions of peace and reconstruction now had to be discussed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden, having resigned as Lincoln's Treasury 
        Secretary in early 1865, wrote the following words to the sixteenth president, 
        thanking him for his trust:<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Allow me&#133;to congratulate you upon the greatly improved aspect 
        of our national affairs&#133;.That your future administration may be crowned 
        with entire success, and that you may at its close take with you into 
        retirement the well-deserved gratitude of the people you have well and 
        faithfully ruled, is the most fervent wish of Your friend and obt. Servant, 
        W. P. Fessenden.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p>Abraham Lincoln, however, did not get a chance to retire. John Wilkes 
        Booth's bullet found him in his hour of triumph and elevated Andrew Johnson 
        of Tennessee to the presidency. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1823, had recently won reelection to his 
        senate seat even though he had not campaigned personally for it. Returning 
        to Washington in December of 1865, the senator from Maine was among the 
        members of Congress who were upset that Johnson had not called a special 
        session to deal with the issues surrounding Reconstruction.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The President believed that he had the power to deal with Reconstruction 
        without Congress. This belief, however, was not in line with what many 
        in Congress believed. Fessenden, for instance, thought that the former 
        rebels had no constitutional rights until Congress had readmitted them. 
        Swearing an oath of allegiance was not enough proof for him that the Southerners 
        were loyal citizens again. Congress needed to readmit their representatives 
        first. When Johnson made two proclamations, declaring amnesty and creating 
        a convention in North Carolina to begin the reconstruction process, Fessenden 
        noted that &quot;In these proclamations the President had jumbled his 
        powers together.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>When Congress reconvened that December, eight months after Lincoln's 
        assassination, the members were out to take matters back into their own 
        hands. Fessenden found himself at the head of the Senate Finance Committee 
        once again. But he was also placed at the head of the newly formed Joint 
        Committee on Reconstruction. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Andrew Johnson's actions quickly earned him the hatred of many congressmen 
        and senators. He used his authority to veto two bills, which would have 
        helped newly freed blacks gain aid and representation. Johnson also attacked 
        Congress, calling it an illegal body since it had failed to seat the eleven 
        members of the Southern states, which with Johnson's approval had returned 
        to Washington-many of these representatives had been high-placed Confederate 
        officials, hence Congress's hesitation to admit them.<br>
        The Joint Committee on Reconstruction met and discussed its options. </p>
      <p>Senator Fessenden wanted guarantees made that the Civil War could never 
        recur and also supported equal rights for African-Americans. In its report, 
        the Joint Committee noted that former Confederates should have no rights 
        until they had demonstrated their loyalties to the government against 
        which they had rebelled.<br>
      </p>
      <p>During this busy congressional session, Fessenden dealt with other issues 
        as well. He had helped Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch slow down the 
        government's money machine now that there was no need for a wartime economy. 
        Fessenden had also disapproved of Secretary William H. Seward's purchase 
        of Alaska from Russia, believing the territory to be a worthless wasteland. 
        In other issues, Fessenden also debated the Army Appropriations Bill and 
        had opposed the passage of the Tenure of Office Bill, a law that restricted 
        the Executive's authority to remove officials. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Tensions between the two sides were allowed to mount as Johnson turned 
        more and more towards the conservatives. Congress would not shut its doors, 
        believing that it should stay in session, for fear that the President 
        would make other unacceptable policy changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sixty years old and in a state of failing health, Fessenden seriously 
        considered retiring from the Senate. He had long wanted to return to his 
        beloved state of Maine, where the fresh air and ocean always revitalized 
        his soul. He had eyed the position of judge of the U.S. District Court 
        of Maine but when the seat opened up, however, Fessenden had to turn it 
        down, realizing that he was needed most in the United States Senate.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And thus, old, sick, and lonely, William Pitt Fessenden surrendered his 
        last chance of a peaceful retirement to serve his country and hold the 
        fort against radical Republicans. As 1868 dawned, Fessenden prepared to 
        fight his final battle.</p>
