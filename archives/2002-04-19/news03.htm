      <p> The student body elected officers last weekend to the Bowdoin student 
        government (BSG), formerly the joint bodies of the Student Executive Board 
        and the student congress, for the academic year 2002-2003. This election 
        marks the first under the amended student government constitution, which 
        replaced previous bicameral government.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There were 653 votes submitted electronically from the three class years 
        eligible to vote; excluded was the Class of 2002 which will join the ranks 
        of alumni when the officers take their posts.<br>

      <p>Jason Hafler '04, elected President, will be embarking on his third year 
        of student government involvement. The president will be, as outlined 
        in the new constitution, &quot;responsible for running and setting the 
        agenda for Student Government meetings,&quot; and representing the student 
        body before the Board of Trustees. He praises the, &quot;great group of 
        individuals who have the opportunity to make a difference on campus.&quot; 
        And said he is excited about his new role. Under the new structure of 
        BSG, Jason said the more clearly delineated positions which are modeled 
        after the trustee committees, are &quot;more accessible.&quot; He said, 
        &quot;Students will know who they need to go to motivate action.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Colin LeCroy '04 will take the helm as Vice President of Facilities, 
        with his goal to &quot;dry the school's pants&quot; by focusing on the 
        improvement of the college's laundry facilities. LeCroy said he will also 
        lead changes in, &quot;parking, security, building hours, and other matters 
        assigned by the BSG,&quot; and will serve as student representative to 
        the trustee committee on facilities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Pat Burns '03, the newly elected Vice President of Academic Affairs, 
        said that he is &quot;proud to be part of the first year of the newly 
        reformed student congress. I will work my hardest to make sure that the 
        new system improves upon the accomplishments of the old.&quot; According 
        to the new constitution, Burns will be expected to, &quot;coordinate BSG 
        activity relating to classes, faculty, and staff,&quot; as chair of the 
        academic affairs committee, and as the student representative to the trustee 
        committee on academic affairs and the faculty committee on curriculum 
        and education policy (CEP).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Conor Williams '05 will step up as Vice President of Student Affairs. 
        He said his year will be dedicated to &quot;a consistent devotion to addressing 
        and integrating student ideas and concerns with the student government.&quot; 
        Williams will be expected to work closely with the athletics department, 
        the Judicial Board, and the house system, and to represent students before 
        the trustee and faculty committees on student affairs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Haliday Douglas '05 will become the Vice President of Student Organizations. 
        According to the constitution, he will &quot;chair the BSG committee on 
        student organizations and shall coordinate government activity relating 
        to charter reviews and such other matters assigned by the BSG.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Edward MacKenzie '03, the second of two rising seniors among the group, 
        said he is &quot;hopeful about the new constitutional structure, which 
        should distribute tasks in a more effective and efficient manner,&quot; 
        as he takes his position as Vice President of Student Government Affairs. 
        His position &quot;shall coordinate BSG activity relating to publicity, 
        surveys, elections, the website, the budget, college committee appointments, 
        reports from college committees, and such other matters appointed by the 
        BSG. &quot; He will also serve as representative to the Board of Trustees.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rounding out the student government is Tejus Ajmera '04 who has been 
        elected treasurer, formerly Student Activities Fees Committee Chair. The 
        financial officer position is designed to &quot;keep all financial records 
        for the student government and shall prepare a budget with the assistance 
        of the president and vice president of student government affairs.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The BSG also added an opinion poll on the plus/minus controversy to the 
        election ballots. Of the total 653 voters, 548 (84 percent) students prefer 
        that their transcripts remain consistent with the current ABC grading 
        system, while 105 (16 percent) would rather have their transcripts reflect 
        the new plus/minus system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Meghan MacNeil, the current chair of the Executive Board, credits the 
        high voter turnout to the candidates and the increased publicity for the 
        election. She also cited the electronic voting system as fostering a greater 
        ease for students to cast their votes. &quot;The great voting system which 
        CIS has helped us set up has played a role in the resultant high percentage 
        of votes,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>MacNeil, who played a central role in cementing the new shape of the 
        BSG, said she is &quot;happy with the structure and group of people. They 
        are poised to get great things done for the campus.&quot;</p>
