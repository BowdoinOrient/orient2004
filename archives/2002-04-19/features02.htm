        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.</font><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p> <i>Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;Is there a safe, cheap, effective way to get 
        rid of body hair so that it doesn't grow back thicker and quicker? (i.e. 
        not shaving or lasers.) Thanks,&quot; M.E.</i></p>
      <p>Dear M.E.: The only conventional hair removal modality that is permanent, 
        is electrolysis. Laser treatment would definitely also be permanent, but 
        it's very, very expensive, requires general anesthesia, and carries a 
        certain amount of risk. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With electrolysis, the hair follicle itself is destroyed by an electric 
        current, and new hair can no longer grow. Electrolysis can, however, cause 
        considerable local irritation, as well as pit-like scarring. The outcome 
        depends on the skill of the operator, and treatment can be expensive. 
        If you are considering electrolysis, make sure the operator is licensed 
        and uses sterilized instruments.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All other methods of body hair removal are temporary. The hair will eventually 
        grow back, although not necessarily any thicker or quicker than before. 
        Here are the pros and cons of commonly available alternatives to shaving.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Tweezing hairs is obviously cheap and easy, but it can be painful and 
        hard to recommend for more than a few stray hairs. Plucking a hair does 
        not destroy its follicle, and so a new hair will grow back quickly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Chemical depilatories are inexpensive and easy to apply, but can be irritating 
        to your skin. Depilatories should always be &quot;test applied&quot; first 
        to a small area of skin to judge your sensitivity to that particular product. 
        Depilatories cause hair proteins to dissolve, but leave hair roots and 
        follicles intact. New, replacement hairs will start growing almost immediately.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Waxing can be expensive, especially if done professionally, although 
        you certainly can do it yourself at home. Most people would rate its discomfort 
        level as tolerable. After waxing, hair growth resumes after a few weeks, 
        although it may diminish some over time. Regular, do-it-yourself waxing 
        may well be the &quot;safe,&quot; &quot;cheap,&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; 
        method you're seeking to control that unwanted body hair. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Medical alternatives to mechanical hair removal do exist. Spironolactone, 
        for instance, a diuretic (&quot;water pill&quot;) most often prescribed 
        for high blood pressure, is sometimes used to treat facial hirsuitism 
        in women. Birth control pills, especially those, like Ortho Tricyclen 
        or Zovia, which contain one of the newer progestins, often have anti-androgenic 
        activity that lessens excess hair growth (the same mechanism that works 
        for acne.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Remember, though, that the growth of excess facial or body hair can be 
        a sign of a hormonal imbalance, either from an endocrine problem or a 
        medication side effect. Certain birth control pills, for instance, can 
        cause this kind of problem for particular individuals (and not for others). 
        If the unwanted hair involves more than a few stray hairs, and they're 
        new and increasing in number, you should consider seeking medical evaluation 
        at the Health Center.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And, finally, consider this. Removing body hair from our legs, underarms, 
        etc., etc. may be consonant with our own cultural biases and aesthetics, 
        and, obviously, if that's how you choose to look, that's how you should 
        make yourself look. Don't be fooled, however, by media-borne images of 
        perfectly hairless (and otherwise perfectly perfect) bodies. What waxing 
        doesn't accomplish, computer re-imaging does. Shouldn't it seem a little 
        more peculiar to us all that advertisers are trying to make us want to 
        look like the re-engineered pictures of models who aren't even all there 
        themselves? <br>
      </p>
      <p>One final thought. Have you ever wondered why we even have body hair 
        at all? The current leading theories have to do with pheromones, the natural, 
        odorless scents produced by our bodies to attract others. The idea is 
        that pheromones are trapped by body hair, and then slowly released into 
        the air. While our bodies have the same number of hair follicles as apes, 
        they do produce, for the most part, only very fine hairs in comparison. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>To your health and happiness!</p>
