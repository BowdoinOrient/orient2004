      <p> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to work with Gary Flood of the Bowdoin 
        College Electric Shop in increasing campus electrical efficiency. We installed 
        Vending Misers that were purchased by Sustainable Bowdoin into four of 
        the first-year dorms: Winthrop, Appleton, Hyde and Coleman. </p>
      <p>A Vending Miser should also be installed in Maine by the time this issue 
        is in print.</p>
      <p>Vending Misers are simple devices that drastically reduce the amount 
        of energy used by soda vending machines. Each device contains a motion 
        sensor and a temperature gauge, and powers down the vending machine when 
        no one is around. The temperature guage switches the compressor only when 
        the necessary to minimize energy use in keeping the sodas cold.</p>
      <p>Here at Bowdoin, electricity usage per student has more than doubled 
        in the last eighteen years, and saving energy has become a huge priority. 
        Many other colleges have installed Vending Misers and have reported efficiency 
        increases of about 50 percent on average. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Vending Misers cost $80 apiece, but should save the college more than 
        that within a year. Every year after that, the devices earn money while 
        decreasing our impact on the environment. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Students, Faculty, and staff can help the College save energy without 
        spending any money themselves. Turning off lights, stereos, and computers 
        when leaving a room saves a great deal. Avoiding the use of appliances 
        like refrigerators, hair dryers, and microwaves (and unplugging them when 
        they are not in use) also saves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you would like more information about Sustainable Bowdoin's activities 
        or how you can help Bowdoin save energy, please email Keisha Payson (<a href="mailto:kpayson@bowdoin.edu">kpayson</a>)

      <p><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>It's the liberals that suppress speech</font></p>
      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In last week's Orient, Michael Saur '02 attacked my article [&quot;College 
        faculty out of touch with U.S.,&quot; 5 April 2002], labeling my rhetoric 
        &quot;Limbaugh-like,&quot; and writing that my &quot;McCarthy-like approach 
        to politics&quot; was &quot;extremely frightening.&quot; Saur's distortions 
        of my article and views are disturbing, and well worth addressing here.<br>
      </p>
      <p>First, Saur questioned the poll I cited by labeling Frank Luntz a &quot;classic 
        GOP hack.&quot; Luntz conducts polls for the Republican Party, a fact 
        I never denied, but Saur's contention that the survey demonstrated what 
        Republicans thought they could &quot;sell to the public&quot; is patently 
        false. The survey was conducted last November, years after Newt Gingrich 
        and the Contract with America became politically irrelevant. Luntz's survey 
        of Ivy League professors has nothing to do with some shadowy GOP agenda.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Saur's principal gripe is that I am somehow attempting to silence his 
        right to dissent. This is curious, considering that dissent was not the 
        subject of my article. I noted that college leftists seem to delight in 
        savaging their nation in print and speech, but I never said they shouldn't 
        have this right. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, it is the people on Saur's side of the aisle-the liberal college 
        administrators-who have led the charge to restrict campus free speech. 
        Speech codes have led to the suppression of any ideas deemed &quot;harassing,&quot; 
        &quot;inappropriate,&quot; or &quot;insensitive&quot; by the politically 
        correct powers that be. <br>
        At Dartmouth, conservative papers were stolen while the administration 
        looked the other way; at Colby, protesters destroyed an art exhibition 
        that featured pictures of the Rodney King beating. It is liberals, not 
        conservatives, who are trying to silence free speech at colleges and universities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Saur closed out his letter with a venomous, self-righteous rant about 
        how I &quot;disrespect every soldier or sailor who perished to defend 
        our freedom&quot; from my &quot;ideological fanaticism.&quot; I do no 
        such thing. In fact, as a liberal, Saur aligns himself with those who 
        disrespected a whole generation of veterans. The ill-informed communist 
        dupes of the 1960s antiwar movement set the standard for mistreatment 
        of our fighting men.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Saur stated that Bowdoin &quot;has made a commendable effort to draw 
        conservative speakers and lecturers to the college.&quot; I agree with 
        him on this point. In fact, I would urge Saur to listen to the likes of 
        Bill Kristol and George Will. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As an &quot;old-line labor Democrat,&quot; Saur is part of a dying breed. 
        As Tom Wolfe notes, &quot;By the year 2000, the term &quot;working class&quot; 
        had fallen into disuse in the United States.... The average electrician 
        or burglar-alarm repairman lived a life that would have made the Sun King 
        blink.&quot; If Saur ever recognizes the futility of his efforts, I'm 
        sure he would be welcomed with open arms by conservatives.</p>
