        <font size="2">PATRICK ROCKEFELLER</font></font></p>
      <p> In the most recent issue of the <i>Disorient</i>, a section was included 
        that listed the number of Israelis killed versus the number of Palestinians 
        killed in the current intifadah. The section claimed that 1256 Palestinians 
        had died through the end of March, while 202 Israelis had been killed. 
        Although the numbers were merely listed and not part of an article, the 
        intent was clear: to show that Israel is the brutal, oppressive government 
        and that the Palestinians are victims.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is a prime example of moral equivalency. The suggestion is that 
        Israel is at fault because more Palestinians have died in the conflict. 
        However, such a conclusion ignores the fact that Yasser Arafat and the 
        Palestinians started the intifadah, not the Israelis. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But numbers don't make a victim. For example, American soldiers killed 
        more German soldiers in WWII, but I would hardly characterize the as Nazis 
        &quot;victims.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>More importantly, such a conclusion trivializes the importance of the 
        conflict. If 3,000 people died in the September 11 attacks, and the U.S. 
        responded with military action in Afghanistan, does our fight become morally 
        unjustifiable after the 3,001 Afghani death? U.S. military action was 
        not an act of revenge; an eye for an eye. It was intended to eliminate 
        the means of terror, and the numbers dead do not reflect a justification 
        for the war.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Recently, the White House changed a small but important piece of its 
        rhetoric. People who strap explosives to their chests and detonate them 
        in public places will no longer be called suicide bombers, but homicide 
        bombers. This nomenclature is much more accurate and ends another disturbing 
        bit of moral equivalency.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Most people probably don't care what you call them, but the distinction 
        is important to make because words are important. The title of &quot;suicide 
        bomber&quot; suggests self-destruction and is linked to martyrdom. But 
        the intent of these bombers is not to take their own lives-that is incidental. 
        Their goal is to kill as many innocent Jews as they can. They are not 
        making a demonstration of self-inflicted injury to protest a cause; they 
        are killing others without giving value to their own lives.<br>
      </p>
      <p>These are not the monks who set themselves on fire to protest the Vietnam 
        War. To equate those suicides-violent acts of protest affecting only the 
        monks themselves-to the attacks of Palestinian homicide bombers-where 
        the objective is to kill others-is ridiculous. Terrorists do not deserve 
        that level of respect. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And that is what they are: terrorists. They are not &quot;freedom fighters.&quot; 
        To that statement, many will respond, &quot;Who are we to judge whether 
        or not they're freedom fighters?&quot; This is a rhetorical statement 
        that implies our position as &quot;no better&quot; and therefore unfit 
        to cast judgment. &quot;Who are we to judge?&quot; is intended as a conversation-ender 
        from those who support moral equivalency, the idea that American or Western 
        culture is no better than any other, and may in fact be worse. In reality, 
        it is the soft bigotry of low expectations masquerading as respect for 
        different cultures. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The homicide bombers are terrorists. Who are we to judge this? We are 
        a liberal democratic society based on freedom of speech, press, religion, 
        and peaceful assembly. We believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of 
        happiness. We are successful economically, politically, and socially. 
        We accept all people from all countries on Earth, regardless of race, 
        creed or political belief, so long as they are willing to live here in 
        peace.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The freedom fighter label would be so much easier to believe if they 
        were fighting on behalf of a nation that would enforce or even endorse 
        freedom. However, considering that the Palestinians' biggest supporters 
        are repressive Islamofascist regimes, such a claim is difficult to validate.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Need an example? The BBC and other sources recently reported that the 
        Mutaween, Saudi Arabia's religious police, beat back schoolgirls who were 
        trying to escape from a fire in their school because they were not wearing 
        the head scarves and robes that are required of them in public. Fifteen 
        girls died.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Is the United States better than Saudi Arabia? You bet. Who are we to 
        judge? We are a secular democracy with respect for the individual, who 
        would rather allow schoolgirls to live than burn for lack of the proper 
        clothing.</p>
