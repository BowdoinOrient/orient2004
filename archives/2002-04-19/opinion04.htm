      <p>Experienced Bowdoin students know that when spring arrives, it not only 
        means the advent of longer days, but also the annual campaign for the 
        mock &quot;Bowdoin Congress&quot; seat. <br>
      </p>
      <p>First years may be confused by the sudden influx of signs all over campus 
        proclaiming &quot;smarter and prettier&quot; candidates with &quot;no 
        more outrageous ideas&quot; and other peppy slogans. Confusion combined 
        with cynical comments from disgruntled upperclassmen may encourage our 
        newcomers to ignore the Gov 361 election, since it is not &quot;real.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, the seat is not real; the election is a class exercise. However, 
        it is a disservice to the dedicated students in Gov 361 to disregard their 
        genuine efforts to both learn about the political process and improve 
        our campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I spoke with the course's instructor, Dr. Christian P. Potholm, a DeAlva 
        Stanwood Alexander Professor of Government and thirty-year veteran of 
        politics and elections. He said that the student body should care about 
        this election because the candidates organize their campaigns around issues 
        that concern the student population. Already, early in the campaign, we 
        see both candidates trying to capture student opinion on the plus/minus 
        debate by suggesting compromise-a &quot;grandfathering&quot; proposal. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Though I am not sure how receptive the faculty will be to this proposal, 
        the Bowdoin electorate should not judge the success of this class exercise 
        on the contentious plus/minus controversy. Professor Potholm indicated 
        that past elections have resulted in changes to school policy. He explained 
        that last year, after candidates photographed a faculty parking lot being 
        empty on many occasions, Security changed the lot's status from faculty 
        to student. Though this policy change may seem minor, it does show the 
        way in which the mock election can foment real reform. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Critics of the election suggest that campaigning and discussing issues 
        disrespects the more formal effort of Student Government to bring student 
        voices to the school administration. Certainly those involved in Student 
        Government perform a great service to us as students. Just recently, it 
        helped change Fall and Spring Break and added the taxi service. However, 
        Student Government should not monopolize the gauging of student opinion. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>There is no reason why the mock election candidates and Student Government 
        officials cannot work together to determine the needs and concerns of 
        our student body. &quot;Team Zhara&quot; has asked a Student Government 
        official to follow them on campaign stops in first-year dormitories, and 
        the official has agreed to do so. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Travis Cummings, Zhara's opponent, told me that his team will discuss 
        issues with Student Government because it &quot;is important to make sure 
        that our campaigns keep a realistic shape to them.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>These are laudable efforts by both candidates to share information with 
        Student Government for the good of the college community. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We the student body should also respect this mock election because it 
        is a public culmination of this class's genuine passion for government 
        and our political process. In this regard, our active participation in 
        the election is absolutely analogous to attending a music recital, a play, 
        an art show, or completing a survey for a sociology class. By offering 
        suggestions, listening to debates, and actively engaging ourselves in 
        the campaign, we show this class the same appreciation for their art as 
        we do to students of any of the aforementioned disciplines.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However the class's most commendable purpose is to combat the entrenched 
        culture of apathy within the &quot;Bowdoin Bubble.&quot; This culture 
        is not unique to Bowdoin. The 18-24 age group consistently votes in a 
        lower percentage than any other demographic. Yet life within the bubble 
        perpetuates our apathy. Our grades are often inflated, all of our meals 
        are provided for us, our dorms are cleaned daily, and there are deans 
        and resource centers for every minority or disadvantaged group. Professor 
        Potholm explained that one goal of the class is to force &quot;Children 
        of Privilege&quot; (or COPS, as he calls them) to work strenuously in 
        pursuit of a tangible goal. This is certainly a redeemable lesson from 
        the course.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, the students of Gov 361 do tireless work to change the Bowdoin 
        campus and encourage good civic habits. Living in a democracy requires 
        an informed and active population to elect the best possible people into 
        public office. Within such a society, it is a sin of indefensible magnitude 
        to complain about issues if one does not consistently vote. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The students of Gov 361 are publicly expressing their passion for our 
        political process. In so doing, their class exercise leads to positive 
        change on the Bowdoin campus and helps combat a culture of apathy. This 
        mock campaign is a service and education to us all and deserves your real 
        support.</p>
