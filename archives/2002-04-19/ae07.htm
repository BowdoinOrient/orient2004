      <p> Bowdoin life is full of spectacle-everywhere you look there's an endless 
        supply of nasty breakups, nervous courtships, long-held grudges, and all-out 
        catfights. Our College offers a wealth of dramatic material, so it's only 
        right that someone finally made a movie out of it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Where else could you see Timmy Pasakarnis '03 watering plants with beer, 
        Hari Kondabolu '04 as a disgruntled math professor, a scandalous up-and-down 
        shot of Lynne Davies '04, and Toby Walch '03 scratching his brief-covered 
        butt? Where else, indeed, but in graduate Stephen Allison's and sophomore 
        Philip Webster's revealing film debut, <i>The Elements of Drama</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The film, a &quot;Heaven Knows Mr. Allison&quot; production, was filmed 
        last semester and had its world premiere in the luxurious Beam Classroom 
        in the Visual Arts Center this Tuesday night. Among those attending were 
        Mr. Allison himself, who wrote and directed the film, his co-director 
        and cinematographer Phil Webster, the star-studded all-Bowdoin cast, various 
        members of the Bowdoin Men's and Women's Track teams, and a crowd of curious 
        Bowdoin students.<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>The Elements of Drama</i> offers more than the glories of college 
        life; it's the story of Chris (Stephen Allison), a star Bowdoin runner 
        with a passion for the sport, who meets Elise, (Lynne Davies), a fellow 
        student, and learns that the only thing standing between them is her boyfriend 
        Ryan (Todd Forsgren '03), his archrival runner from Williams with bad 
        hair and an attitude. After numerous confrontations between the two guys, 
        Elise and Ryan break up. Then Chris struggles to find the confidence to 
        beat Ryan at the next meet and find a way to get the girl. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The film had its fair share of hilarity, as was made obvious by the constant 
        outbursts of laughter. Inside jokes, track team puns, and colorful Bowdoin 
        jargon is strewn throughout the drama. Not to mention the fact that seeing 
        one's friends make total fools of themselves on the &quot;big&quot; screen 
        is funny all on its own.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Particularly humorous were Chris's trio of friends, played by Geoff Cole 
        '04, Jeff Manganaro '03, and Tung Trinh '04 as High Jump Lee. They provided 
        the beer-guzzling college-style comic relief in addition to some moral 
        support for their pal. Also notable was Kat Martens '04, who played Lynn's 
        annoyed but supportive roommate Kath, and, of course, the unstoppable 
        Hari Kondabolu, whose cameo as Chris's math professor was met with immediate 
        and long-lasting applause.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kudos to the filmmakers for adding an outtakes section after the movie-a 
        nice little comic dessert. As if the film weren't funny enough already, 
        we also get to see repeated instances of inappropriate handling of pool 
        cues and Geoff Cole getting smacked in the face by his English tutor. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Steve and Phil would like to thank the Bowdoin Men's and Women's Track 
        teams for participating in the larger crowd sequences, and Coach Slovenski 
        for helping with some little details and for the use of Farley Field House. 
        They also want to give &quot;mad props&quot; to the entire cast for making 
        <i>The Elements of Drama</i> come together so well.</p>
