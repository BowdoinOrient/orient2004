      <p> I want to applaud the students who put the display up in Smith Union 
        this week highlighting the large number of Americans incarcerated by our 
        justice system. The fact that a nation of two hundred and seventy million 
        has locked up almost two million of its inhabitants speaks volumes as 
        to our society. Only Russia, the nation that gave birth to that monstrosity 
        known as the Gulag incarcerates a larger percent of its population.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We spend billions every year to incarcerate these people and it begs 
        the question what is the benefit our society reaps and what is its cost? 
        Is this really the best way to spend this money?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now lets address those who applaud this. Crime is down. The drug trade, 
        and the violent crime associated with it that marked the 1980s, is down. 
        In fact, over 60 percent of those incarcerated today are in prison for 
        non-violent drug offenses. Many applaud this, noting the correlation between 
        drugs and violent crime. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While it is true that a large part of the drop in crime during the 1990s 
        was due to the Clinton-economic boom, it is also true that part of the 
        drop in violent crime is from that fact that these people are no longer 
        on our streets. In this sense, we have succeeded in making society safer. 
        We refuse to pay the cost as a society, thankfully, of executing these 
        people who refuse to live by our code. Thus warehousing them seems to 
        be the only option.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Or is it?<br>
      </p>
      <p>There was another interesting statistic up in the Union. It compared 
        the average annual cost of Head Start per pupil versus the average annual 
        cost of incarcerating an inmate. If I remember correctly it was $4,500 
        for Head Start and $45,000 for the inmate, a ten-fold relation. Now we 
        all know that it has been statistically proven that kids in Head Start 
        are much less likely to end up in prison and much more likely to be productive 
        elements in our society. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This point about education is important and, if you think like me, you'll 
        anticipate the point I'm going to make about that figure (not that it 
        doesn't scream in your face or anything). However let's put it on hold 
        for a second.<br>
        We're doing that because I want to make a point about crime. I am a strong 
        believer in poverty and lack of opportunity being the root of almost all 
        crime. Yes there are always going to be the socio-paths. I went to prep 
        school with a kid who is now in prison (along with his brother) for multiple 
        attempted murders and he came from one of the richest, nicest families 
        in the DC-area. There was just something wrong with his psyche that made 
        him unable to function as a normal human being. <br>
      </p>
      <p>That's not who we're talking about. We're talking about the vast majority 
        of criminals in our prisons today (remember that 60 percent non-violent 
        drug offender number?). They are there because of poverty and lack of 
        education. No one wants to grow up to be thief, a drug dealer, a gangbanger, 
        a drug-user. But when the only opportunity is the remote possibility of 
        a job at McDonalds, what do you expect people to do?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now we'll go back to that number above us. It is ten times more expensive 
        to incarcerate someone than to educate them. Already our society is losing 
        the opportunity of having almost two million of its members contribute 
        anything more than license plates. Shouldn't we be smart and spend the 
        money we use on incarceration more wisely? It sounds like a pretty good 
        investment to me when, for ten percent of the cost, you can almost-entirely 
        ensure that you will not have to imprison someone. We need to spend our 
        money on training and education to ensure that our prison population does 
        not grow any larger.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We can also shrink our population. Instead of having our prisons be merely 
        warehouses for our undesirables, we could spend just a little more money 
        and turn them into places where we could transform people. Many of our 
        prisons now only turn out hardened criminals. What if they were turning 
        out people with marketable job skills? Most people don't want to be criminals, 
        but if that's all you know how to do, that's what you're going to do. 
        Give prisoners a chance at a better life and most will leap for it and, 
        most importantly, we all will benefit.</p>
