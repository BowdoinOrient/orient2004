      <p align="left"><font size="5">Dating and the Black female<br>
        <font size="2">CRYSTAL WELCH</font><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p>I have noticed a certain level of unconsciousness lurking in the air 
        of the Bowdoin community. As an African-American female, I wish to explore 
        a certain level of daily discomfort that Black women feel when submerged 
        in a predominantly white community.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Before I go any further, I feel it necessary to make lucid that African 
        Americans are not the only minorities that experience racism in Bowdoin's 
        social arenas, and females are not the only minority longing for justice. 
        Rather, my method here is more sophisticated than pure discourse.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That being said, this is my attempt to explore the position of Black 
        females on Bowdoin's campus and how they are affected by the cultural 
        images constructed by the privileged.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I conducted a survey, asking students of Black, White, Asian, and Hispanic 
        origins whether or not they felt there was a fair amount of interracial 
        dating at Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Only two students said that Bowdoin had a fair amount of these types 
        of relationships; most said that such dating isn't happening. Many of 
        the White students stated that the College is not particularly diverse, 
        which allows for little interracial dating. Only 20 percent of the White 
        community expressed concern that there is little dating of this sort.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though I am sure that these students mean well, their explanation just 
        doesn't do it for me. In the surveys, 100 percent of Black females acknowledged 
        that a problem with the interracial dating scene exists. None of the Black 
        females surveyed had dated outside their race at Bowdoin. Listen to some 
        of their reasons:<br>
      </p>
      <p>1) I haven't been approached by any men outside my race at Bowdoin.<br>
        2) The guys outside my race don't seem interested.<br>
        3) I have not had the opportunity to date at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The majority of interracial relationships between Black students on campus 
        involve Black males and White females. Many times I find myself wondering 
        why Black females get the short end of the stick. Why are Black males 
        &quot;considered&quot; in the dating pool, while females are not?<br>
      </p>
      <p>I would like to make sense of this absurdity, because many people on 
        a campus &quot;committed to diversity&quot; suffer from it. In answering 
        this question-which I hear bellowing from the mouths of many other African-American 
        women as well-I have found understanding within historical imagery. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The cultural images that embody Black females affect the ways in which 
        we are perceived by non-African-American men. One of the most pervasive 
        images of Black females is the mammy-the large-statured domestic whose 
        position ranges from cook to nanny. The mammy's disposition is inconsistent 
        and dependent upon the person she is dealing with. She is submissive to 
        the white boss, but is crude and sometimes talks down to other Blacks, 
        particularly males. She exerts power over her own kind in order to assume 
        an authoritative position in society. Her overly exaggerated breasts and 
        buttocks are attempts to desexualize her and make her less of a threat 
        to White female counterparts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sapphire is another example of a cultural icon constructed by the privileged 
        to embrace Black female identity. In From Mammy to Miss America and Beyond, 
        K. Sue Jewel says that Sapphire is characterized by &quot;her sassiness, 
        which is exceeded only by her verbosity....Because of her intense expressiveness 
        and hands-on-hip, finger-pointing style, Sapphire is viewed as comedic 
        and is never taken seriously.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The final, most pervasive cultural image of African-American women is 
        the jezebel, also delineated as the bad black girl. She can be either 
        an African American with a light complexion or a mulatto. She has overwhelmingly 
        Eurocentric features including a thin nose, thin lips, and straightened, 
        lengthy hair. The jezebel conforms to a Eurocentric beauty standard and 
        is considered attractive by both White and Black men. The only problem 
        is that even though she is attractive enough to get the White man, her 
        blackness hinders her from keeping him. She is the exact opposite of the 
        mammy/Aunt Jemima figure in that she is hypersexual-her goal is to constantly 
        engage in some type of sexual activity.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With the existence of these negative stereotypes constructed by the White 
        majority, it is no wonder that we as communities suffer without education 
        of our true images. These images' roots lie in the early 20th century, 
        but I can see their poisonous remains in the modern Bowdoin community.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So what do we do about it? Is it the fault of the White community? Is 
        it the responsibility of Bowdoin's African-American women to speak up 
        for themselves and deliver the message that we are neither desexualized 
        nor hypersexual?<br>
      </p>
      <p>While I may not have the answers to such questions, my inclination is 
        to beckon a general consciousness of social dilemmas that African Americans 
        face every day. It is my goal to collapse the distance between the particulars 
        of racial consciousness and the opaqueness of the &quot;Bowdoin bubble.&quot; 
        Black women have long been ostracized from that &quot;cult of true womanhood,&quot; 
        and it is time now to undo that venomous trend.</p>
