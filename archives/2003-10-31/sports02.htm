        <td><font size="2">A varsity player kicks the ball past two Colby defenders during the game last weekend. The women won the match 3-2 and added another win to the team's season record of 11-2. (Hans Law, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>        </tr>
      </table>
            <p align="left">	In a three-way tie for first place in the NESCAC, the Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team needed a win against Colby to keep them at the top.  With the season winding down and the race for the top seed in the upcoming playoffs on, every game needs to be a win for Bowdoin.  </p>
<p align="left">The Polar Bears, aware of this importance, were ready to stomp on the White Mules.  The Bears have never lost to Colby and hold a 31-0-2 edge in the all-time series. They were not ready to let Colby beat them for the first time, especially on their turf.</p>
<p align="left">	The Bears took control of the game from the start.  Michal Shapiro '04 continued her dominant play in the middle and knocked a header in the back of the net off a Cedar Goldman '05 corner kick.  Shapiro has been vital to the team this season, especially in the last two games, scoring the lone goal in the team's victory against UNE last week, as well as jumpstarting the Bears against the Mules.  </p>
<p align="left">	Bowdoin was relentless on the attack scoring two more goals in the next 29 minutes.  Goldman, once again, found a teammate anxiously waiting in the box for her corner kick.  She strategically placed the ball at the feet of first-year Ivy Blackmore, who then nailed it home making the score 2-0.  </p>
<p align="left">Jill Falwell '04 continued to climb up the all-time scoring list, burning by a Colby defender and keeper to knock home the third goal of the game.  With 60 minutes left in the game, the Bears held a comfortable three-goal lead.  </p>
<p align="left">However, the Mules slowly began to chip away at the lead as Christina Andaya took a cross from Laura Williamson and nailed it past Bowdoin keeper Anna Shapell '05 to make it 3-1.  However, the momentum still favored Bowdoin, and the White Mules appeared to be both tired and sterile at the end of the first half.  </p>
<p align="left">As the second half began, the Polar Bears began to lose their steam.  Colby's defense stepped up its play, preventing the ferocious Bowdoin offenders from attacking the Colby keeper.  </p>
<p align="left">On the other end, the Mules were recharged as well.  They were able to find cracks in the Bowdoin defense and had numerous opportunities on goal.  First-year White Mule striker Libba Cox came alive in the second half hounding her sister, Polar Bear central back Kendall Cox '05.  Their match up was fun to watch, not only because both players are extremely intense and hard-working, but also because of the sibling rivalry involved.    </p>
<p align="left">Things became quite scary for the Bears as Colby cut the lead to one goal when Williamson fired a shot into the lower right corner, making the score 3-2 with just over ten minutes to play.  </p>
<p align="left">Although the Bears were not playing their best soccer in the second half, they remained composed.  They did not allow the fire of Colby's offense to take over the game.  They used the clock to their advantage, possessing the ball for long periods of time and forcing Colby to chase the ball and expend much energy.  The Bears were relieved when the whistle blew to end the game; they were saved by the clock and came out victorious.</p>
<p align="left">This Saturday, Bowdoin faces the Bates Bobcats in a huge game that will clinch their playoff spot.  If then win, they secure the number one position and home field advantage for the playoffs.  Please support the Polar Bears in Lewiston at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday.         </p>
