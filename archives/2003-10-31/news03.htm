            <p align="left">Most Bowdoin students may not be from Maine, but many are interested in preserving the long-term character of the state by opposing the proposed casino.</p>
<p align="left">On Tuesday, Maine voters will decide referendum question three, which would create a resort casino in Sanford. </p>
<p align="left">If the referendum passes, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation will be able to conduct gaming through slot machines, card games, and lotteries.</p>
<p align="left">Supporters of the referendum say that the state will receive over $100 million dollars per year through the casino. They say it will create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p align="left">Opponents feel that Maine should either not have casinos or should use a different process to bring one here. Some say that the casino will bring crime to the state. Others feel that a casino might be a good thing, but think that the state should create a bidding process for the gambling license. This bill, they say, creates a casino monopoly, and the state would be better off if it held an auction for the license.</p>
<p align="left">Those against the casino also say that pro-casino supporters are being bankrolled entirely by Las Vegas companies and will hurt the character of Maine. The pro-casino group Think About It has spent over four million dollars on the campaign. All of this money has come from a Las Vegas developer and a Falmouth, Maine, lawyer.</p>
<p align="left">Opponents have the support of many of Maine's powerful. Most Maine newspapers have written editorials opposing the casino. Democratic Governor John Baldacci, Bowdoin Distinguished Lecturer and former Independent Maine Governor Angus King, and Olympian Joan Benoit Samuelson '79 all oppose the casino.</p>
<p align="left">Voters will be answering the question, "Do you want to allow a casino to be run by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and Penobscot Nation if part of the revenue is used for state education and municipal revenue sharing?" </p>
<p align="left">However, the actual bill is 20 pages long. It contains a variety of diverse provisions, including an option for the casino to keep records confidential from the public, an exemption from corporate income taxes, and a restriction that prevents the state from changing any part of the law without the permission of the tribes.</p>
<p align="left">Chris Gaskill '04, president of Bowdoin College Democrats though not speaking for the organization, is in favor of the casino. "It will create many jobs," he said. "Plus, who wouldn't want a casino nearby?"</p>
<p align="left">Luke Wilson '06 has studied the issue extensively for his Maine politics class and does not support to the measure. "The casino legislation is rife with traps," he said. He points to parts of the legislation that allow children to gamble in the casino and police officers to be kept off of casino grounds.</p>
<p align="left">On Wednesday, proponents of the casino announced that they will only occasionally have special events in which children can participate, and children will not be involved with direct gambling. However, the text of the proposed law does not limit the number of times that the casino could operate such bazaars. The measure specifically holds that all casino games will be conducted "without limitation" from the state. </p>
<p align="left">Government professor Chris Potholm doesn't oppose all casinos-just this one. "I am not against gambling," he said. "I'm not against an Indian casino. I'm very much against the proposed Indian casino in Sanford. It's a very bad deal for Maine."</p>
<p align="left">Government professor Jean Yarbrough feels that this casino is wrongly being presented as a fix to the high taxes in Maine. "Maine will see very little of this money, and citizens will lose control over the entire issue forever," she said. "Maine should not try to solve its economic problems by promoting behavior that is personally and socially destructive."</p>
<p align="left">Students from Nevada have varying views. Betsy Bradford '06 of Reno said, "It's a shady deal. I think it would be more worthwhile to focus on diversifying the Maine economy instead of focusing on more tourism."</p>
<p align="left">Tim Dooley '06, also of Reno, disagrees. He has worked in casinos, and said, "When treated properly, gambling is a recreational activity that brings many people enjoyment."</p>
<p align="left">"Even if the percentage of each amount played in a slot machine that the state would receive is minimal, remember how much money is being played," he said.</p>
<p align="left">Katherine Hayes '06 of Topsham, Maine, opposes the casino. "The casino would change the dynamics of little towns such as Kennebunk, which have been preserved in their purity since Maine's beginnings," she said.</p>
<p align="left">Recently published reports say that the floor space of the casino will be larger than any casino 2003-10-31ly in Las Vegas.</p>
<p align="left">"A big part of my decision to attend school here was rooted in Maine's integrity and its strong character," Hayes said. "If a casino were to come to Maine, I feel like it would debase Maine's value for what it truly is."</p>
<p align="left">According to published reports, opposition is strongest in southern Maine. Fear about the children's games at the casino have also helped to build up resistance in recent days. Some of the most recent polls suggest that the anti-casino forces will prevail on Tuesday.</p>
