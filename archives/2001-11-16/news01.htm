        <font size="2">ANNE WARREN<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left">Recently, a small group of Bowdoin students and auditors 
        enjoyed the rare opportunity to meet and engage in intimate political 
        discussion with 11 prominent Mainers who hope to become the state's next 
        Governor, Senator, or Congressman. The students, from Professor Chris 
        Potholm's Introduction to Maine Politics class, hosted their annual Candidate's 
        Fair last Thursday, November 8. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It's a terrific compliment to the students that the 
        candidates showed up at 8:30 in the morning. Many of them even came out 
        of their districts,&quot; Potholm said. <br>
        Over the course of the fall semester, Professor Potholm's class has been 
        actively following the opening stages of the campaigns for Governor, U.S. 
        Senator, and Congressman in the state's second district. Through polling, 
        research, and interviews with some of the candidates and their campaign 
        managers, the students have become familiar with the candidates' stances 
        on issues, their strengths, weaknesses, and tactics that will aid in their 
        election next November. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The purpose of the fair was to provide an open forum for 
        the students to meet some of the candidates, share their own research, 
        and hear about the current states and future directions of the campaigns. 
        The event also allowed students interested in participating in a political 
        campaign to identify candidates for whom they would like to work. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Congressional candidate Mike Michaud emphasized the need 
        for politicians to listen to their constituents, especially students. 
        &quot;It's very important for people to get involved at the university 
        level. All too often politicians get into a mode where they think they 
        know all the answers, but a lot of times they can learn a lot from listening 
        to the general public,&quot; said Michaud.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., Smith Auditorium buzzed with 
        the sound of political discussion. Groups met individually with nearly 
        all of the 11 candidates. The impressive list included Gubernatorial candidates 
        Daniel Wathen (R), Peter Cianchette (R), John Jenkins (I), and Jonathan 
        Carter (Green Party), Senatorial candidate Bob Dunfy (D), and 2nd Congressional 
        District candidates David Costello (D), Susan Longley (D), Mike Michaud 
        (D), Laurie Handrahan (D), Dick Campbell (R), and Tim Woodcock (R).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This forum was somewhat indicative of two groups of 
        constituents that need to be heard and addressed-college students embarking 
        on careers and senior citizens finishing them. It exposed concerns across 
        generations,&quot; Jenkins said. <br>
        &quot;To be engaged [with the students] at this level of intimacy is fabulous,&quot; 
        Campbell remarked. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While each of the campaigns are currently at various states 
        of progression in terms of fundraising, advertising, and stances on issues, 
        all of the candidates expressed great commitment to the people of Maine 
        and the nation they hope to serve. They were also visibly impressed with 
        the Bowdoin students they spoke with and emphasized the importance of 
        the country's youth in generating effective strategies for the future.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Fresh energy and ideas come from the students. In 
        recent years, there's been a lot of apathy. Now, hopefully, more students 
        will be motivated to get involved,&quot; Dunfey said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In reference to the recent terrorist attacks of September 
        11, Costello said the following to the students: &quot;People your age 
        are in a wonderful position because tremendous global opportunities have 
        been opened. This is the time for you to get involved.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Green Party candidate Jonathan Carter commended Professor 
        Potholm in bringing the students and candidates together. &quot;Chris 
        Potholm did a service to our campaign and everyone else's campaign. Students 
        want leadership now that will lead them in the right direction in the 
        future,&quot; Carter said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The forum allowed people separated by an ideological 
        divide to deal with one another as people,&quot; Woodcock commented. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Following the Fair, Professor Potholm commented on the overall 
        success and productivity of the event. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I thought the class did an excellent job of not only 
        inviting the candidates but also in interviewing them. I found the different 
        candidate styles intriguing-some made personal and some made ideological 
        pitches for support. I gather a couple of students even got paying jobs 
        out of it,&quot; Potholm said.<br>
