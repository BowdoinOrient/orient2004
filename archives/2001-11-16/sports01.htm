      <p align="left">TENNESSE TITANS: We all remember Kevin Dyson - twisting, 
        turning, slicing - desperately trying to earn one more yard and win Super 
        Bowl XXXIV. It was perhaps the greatest Super Bowl finish of all time, 
        as the Rams won by less than a yard.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This week's Monday Night Football game featured the Titans 
        and former Super Bowl champ Baltimore Ravens. With the ball spotted on 
        the one-yard line and only seconds left, Tennessee QB Steve McNair took 
        the snap and bull-dozed his way into the endzone for the game-winning 
        touchdown.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There was only a minor problem, however. A Ravens' offside 
        penalty - prior to the snap - nullified the play. The referees edged the 
        ball closer to the goal line and let the Titans take another crack at 
        it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There was only a minor problem, however. The Ravens waited 
        on a McNair quarterback sneak and prevented the game-winning touchdown 
        as time expired. With the 16-10 victory, the Ravens move to 6-3, while 
        the Titans drop to a disappointing 3-5 record.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If only football fields were 99 yards, the Titans would 
        enter the midway point of the season with a .500 record and a Super Bowl 
        XXXIV trophy on the mantle at home. Too bad the actual length of the field 
        is 100 yards.<br>
        Anyone want to place a bet on when the Titans' management will petition 
        the league for a shorter field?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">NBA DISHING OUT THE FINES: What is up with the NBA fining 
        players for voicing their opinions? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Denver Nuggets point guard Nick Van Exel shelled out 30 
        grand over the past week due to his distain for referee's treatment of 
        his team.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Said Van Exel, &quot;Cowards don't make it any easier for 
        you, I'll tell you that much. It's ridiculous some of the calls we get, 
        some of the calls other teams get. It's like we are the scrubs of the 
        league. We don't get no respect. None. It ain't gonna change, so I'm going 
        to keep cussing them out.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With the Nuggets making it into postseason play once in 
        the past ten years, they will not receive much respect around the league. 
        But, what's wrong with Van Exel demanding it through the press and criticizing 
        the officials? Isn't that what free speech is all about?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Charles Oakley of the woeful Chicago Bulls was also recently 
        fined to the tune of 50 grand. Bull's General Manager Jerry Krause fined 
        one of his few veteran players after a 53 point loss to the Minnesota 
        Timberwolves.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After the game, Oakley attacked Head Coach Tim Floyd's substitution 
        patterns: &quot;If we're not trying to win, we might as well play the 
        young guys and get blown out by 50 every other night.&quot; The Bulls 
        responded with a hefty fine.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The NBA needs to allow its players to voice their opinions. 
        If the league succeeds in its quest to silence dissenters, we may hear 
        remarks like: &quot;Well, it was a team effort. It takes 12 guys working 
        together to lose by this much. But, thanks to our coach and the organization, 
        we didn't lose by 60! We'll get them next game!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">BASEBALL NEWS: What's new? Big Mac is retiring, Roger Clemens 
        is not, and neither is Barry Bonds.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mark McGwire: Lacking the physical and mental ability to 
        fight off injuries and the fatigue of being a Major League Baseball player, 
        one of the greatest power hitters of all time decided retirement was the 
        best looking pitch to hit.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After batting only .187 in 298 at-bats last year, Mark McGwire 
        realized that he is not the same player who captivated the nation with 
        70 home runs in 1998. <br>
        Big Mac finishes his storied career with 585 home runs, which is fifth 
        overall in the record books. He is also leaving a Cardinals organization 
        that is very much a contender in the National League. Who will replace 
        this first baseman? His good friend and free agent, Jason Giambi of the 
        Oakland A's of course. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Roger Clemens: At age 39, Clemens has no intentions of retiring 
        any time soon. A week ago, the Rocket claimed a record-setting sixth Cy 
        Young Award thanks to his 20-3 record and 213 strikeouts. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This mention of the ex-Red Sox pitcher is the part where 
        New Englanders stop reading my column and mutter a foul comment about 
        how he should have stayed with Boston. Ready to continue?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Roger should share his secret with Michael Jordan, who has 
        not regained the swagger and style of his younger self thus far in his 
        comeback. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And now onto another old man: the 37-year-old Barry Bonds 
        who enjoyed the greatest season of his career, as he hit 73 home runs 
        and claimed the highest slugging percentage in baseball history. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, during his chase for Mac's 70, he received several 
        death threats from jerks who wanted the title to stay in the hands of 
        McGwire.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bonds said, &quot;I really didn't start hitting (home runs) 
        at first because I was really nervous. It was like, 'I could get shot 
        out here.' I was thinking, did I tell my mom I loved her? Did I tell my 
        dad? All these scary thoughts were going through my mind.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Giants Manager Dusty Baker reminded Bonds that Hank Aaron, 
        a former Giant who holds the record for most homers in a career, also 
        dealt with the same crap. It's called poor sportsmanship. Worse than that 
        though, it's called racism.<br>
