      <p><font size="5">Dr. Dines must meet her brothers</font><br>
        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><br>
      </p>
      <p> Those of us who are not freshmen may remember the presentation made 
        last April by Dr. Gail Dines. She is a sociologist who showed how pornography 
        exploits women. As much as I agreed with that general point, I was offended 
        by many of her sweeping generalizations about the male sex that detracted 
        from her main theme. If only she had avoided making ridiculously general 
        statements such as &quot;talking to a man is like talking to an erection&quot; 
        and &quot;all men are rapists,&quot; I would have left the auditorium 
        much happier. Contrary to her opinion of the male sex, many men in fact 
        agree with her that women are exploited in pornography and that such images 
        not only demean women but also are detrimental to our entire society.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the most recent issue of &quot;National Review,&quot; the magazine 
        runs a cover story entitled &quot;Porn is everywhere, A call for action.&quot; 
        In the two articles connected to this theme, writers William F. Buckley 
        Jr. and Jay Nordlinger discuss the legal, ethical, and economic ways in 
        which communities and by implication our nation as a whole can combat 
        pornography. Their methods are far less divisive than the fractious remarks 
        made by Dr. Dines last spring since they do not offend an entire half 
        of the population. They also elucidate the reasons why such an awareness 
        to pornography's pervasiveness is necessary for the ameliorating of society. 
      </p>
      <p>It is here where it is necessary to return to the elements of Dr. Dines's 
        speech with which I agreed. The most basic was the notion that pornography 
        was an inappropriate objectification of women. Whenever one watches a 
        film with pornography in it, one sees immediately how women are portrayed 
        as if they are products on display at a store. Without getting too crude, 
        it is clearly obvious that certain areas of her body are displayed to 
        satisfy male sexual eros. Many women including Dr. Dines are understandably 
        angered by this because of the offense that they take to being viewed 
        with the same disrespect as a quantifiable item, rather than a living 
        and emotive human being. </p>
      <p>However, this sort of objectification should offend us all. There should 
        be no doubt that repeated portrayal of sexual acts in film and media encourages 
        promiscuous behavior. This statement is easily defended using the same 
        logic that public interests groups have used to condemn the cigarette 
        and alcohol industries for targeting youth. In his article, William F. 
        Buckley Jr. asks rhetorically &quot;if cigarette ads sell cigarettes, 
        why doesn't Esquire[sexually explicit advertising within the magazine] 
        sell sex?&quot; Mr. Buckley demonstrates the clear connection between 
        the viewing of repeated sexual images and the likelihood of a promiscuous 
        lifestyle. </p>
      <p>One need not even be a believer in &quot;Judeo-Christian&quot; values 
        to see the damage that promiscuity does to a society. A recent tragic 
        anniversary demonstrates the clear public health consequences from promiscuity. 
        Last week was the 10th anniversary of Magic Johnson's announcement that 
        he had contracted HIV. There is ample medical evidence that indicates 
        that a promiscuous sex life increases one's chances of acquiring AIDS 
        or any other Sexually Transmitted Disease. Even the most ardent supporters 
        of condom availability in high schools acknowledge that abstinence is 
        the only sure way to prevent infection. </p>
      <p><br>
        Clearly there are reasons for condemning an excessively promiscuous life 
        that transcend moralistic overtones. There is little doubt that sexually 
        suggestive images in both film and the internet encourage a lifestyle 
        that is both detrimental to those who engage in it and to society at large. 
      </p>
      <p>Sexual images and pornography are certainly lucrative, however that does 
        not mean that society cannot temper pornography's pervasiveness. If commentators 
        and critics from both the left and the right united around this issue, 
        pornography and inappropriate sexual images could meet the same social 
        resistance as the tobacco industry, which is no longer allowed to target 
        kids. However, it will take a recognition by people like Dr. Dines that 
        many of her male brothers are not rapists, and rather agree with her on 
        this issue, before the anti-pornography forces can make a loud enough 
        stand for people to notice. <br>
