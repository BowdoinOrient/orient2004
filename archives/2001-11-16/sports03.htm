      <p>The Bowdoin Men's Cross-Country Team finished second out of 35 teams 
        in the New England Division III Championship at Westfield State last Saturday. 
        The top five teams-Keene State, Bowdoin, MIT, Tufts, and Williams--will 
        run in the NCAA DIII Nationals tomorrow, held in Rock Island, Illinois.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Keene State, the runner-up at last year's national championship, won 
        the New England race with a total 54 points. Bowdoin (84 points) matched 
        their 1991 second-place NE finish. MIT, Tufts, and Williams, the other 
        three national qualifiers, tallied 106, 113, and 128 points, respectively. 
        Trinity, Bates, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Colby, and Amherst rounded 
        out the top ten.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin men demonstrated a mastery of the Westfield State course 
        en route to their second place finish. Bowdoin's first runner, co-captain 
        Steve Allison '01, finished in eighth place with a time of 25:17. <br>
      </p>
      <p>He was followed by co-captain Todd Forsgren '03, who took tenth place 
        with 25:22. Fellow junior Pat Vardaro finished 14th overall, and clocked 
        a time of 25:33. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Juniors Jeff Rubens (22nd) and Scott Barbuto (29th) both broke the 26:00 
        minute mark, and solidified Bowdoin's NCAA Championship berth. Scott Herrick 
        '04 finished in 41st place, while seventh-man Conor O'Brien took the 64th 
        spot.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Jeff Rubens and Scott Barbuto had exceptional races. You can tell 
        we had a great day, because our fourth and fifth runners made the All-New 
        England team,&quot; head coach Peter Slovenski said. &quot;We are one 
        of the top-ranked teams in the nation because Jeff and Scott have been 
        all-star caliber runners for us this season.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Barbuto ran a particularly exceptional, come-from-behind race. He was 
        in 60th place at the one-mile mark, moved up to 50th after two miles, 
        and, three miles later, finished in 29th place.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Forsgren indicated that the men's team was pleased with its performance, 
        but hasn't yet reached its peak potential. &quot;Second place in New England 
        is certainly something the team should be very proud of,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;A lot of the guys had great races, with five of us gaining All-New 
        England honors. We've been looking forward to nationals all year, and 
        I think our best race is yet to come.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Slovenski seemed to share Forsgren's view. &quot;We had an excellent 
        race at regionals, but we have been pointing to the national race all 
        season,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll run even better this weekend. We've 
        been preparing for nationals all summer and fall.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The seven-man squad, which departed for Illinois on Thursday, looks to 
        set the Bowdoin College record for the highest finish by any sports team 
        in a NCAA Championship. The women's cross country team currently holds 
        this mark, with their sixth-place finish in the 1994 NCAA Championship. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>O'Brien attempted to explain the mystique of nationals. &quot;It's like 
        a big dance,&quot; he said. &quot;You think all that counts is getting 
        invited. But if it's going to be a night to remember, you had better dress 
        well and make all the right moves.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin men finished 19th in their last trip to nationals, which 
        occured in 1995. The 1991 team was ranked eighth in the country, but was 
        unable to compete nationally, due to NESCAC regulations at the time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This weekend, the men aren't looking to place highly for mere distinction. 
        &quot;Our goal is to have a cross-country team at Bowdoin achieve a national 
        ranking as high as the Bowdoin Dining Service,&quot; Slovenski said. &quot;Our 
        dining service is ranked sixth in the nation. We'll need a terrific race 
        to match that.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We ran close to Keene State--last year's NCAA runner-up--this past 
        weekend,&quot; he continued. &quot;If we can close the gap and get a little 
        closer to Keene, we'll end up as one of the top five teams in the race.&quot;<br>
