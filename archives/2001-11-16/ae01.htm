        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Believe me, I am as shocked as you are. I was walking down Maine Street 
        when all of a sudden my colleague and fellow Ferocious Foodie, Lauren, 
        disappeared. Searching for clues that would indicate her whereabouts, 
        I noticed pink slip-on Puma tracks trailing into the woods. All I may 
        assume is that she wishes to have a few days of relaxation in the New 
        England jungle. <br>
        As a result of my colleague's absence, I must compose this review by myself. 
      </p>
      <p>You may note a difference in writing style: that is because I have taken 
        control of this enterprise completely. Completely! One may recall the 
        old adage, &quot;when the cat's away, the mice will play.&quot; Indeed. 
        Once given a taste of freedom, this mouse may never allow herself to be 
        cloistered in a measly hole-in-the-wall again. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bangkok Garden, conjoined to the antiques mall at the end of Maine Street, 
        offers copious Thai dishes in a pleasant and authentically decorated setting. 
        High wooden ceilings are adorned with Thai tapestries and ornate fans. 
        Unpainted brick walls and large windows evoke an urban flavor; dining 
        here is a refreshing respite from Bowdoin's rural Maine setting. Felicity 
        enthusiasts will note that this establishment resembles Megan and Sean's 
        New York loft. Bangkok Garden brings that WB drama to life, thus pleasing 
        an ardent fan of UNY love triangles!<br>
      </p>
      <p>Flapping arms and scrunched faces reflected a lack of decisiveness among 
        our group--the small-print menu is the size of my town's phone directory. 
        Patient servers dressed in &quot;native&quot; Thai garb attempted to help 
        us make our choices, and we finally selected fresh spring rolls and chicken 
        satay as shared appetizer plates.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Service is very fast: almost as soon as the selections rolled off our 
        tongues, their physical form had arrived. Spring rolls were neatly wrapped 
        and contained very fresh, although somewhat homogenous vegetables. The 
        very spicy accompanying sauce would have been described as &quot;luscious,&quot; 
        by my fellow Foodie if she hadn't been M.I.A. She would have further gushed 
        that the sauce's spice &quot;perfectly heated the little package.&quot; 
        The satay resembled oblong chicken patties, and though it was tasty and 
        well spiced, this dish was also unusual in its &quot;hamburger-on-a-skewer&quot; 
        presentation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Soups were equally pleasing. Chunks of vegetables and piquant dumplings 
        floated in the anise-flavored broth of the Thai Wonton Soup. A foodie 
        friend described this soup as &quot;yummy.&quot; The appropriately named 
        Yum Soup was also well received by our party; however, this Foodie was 
        turned off not by its intense heat but its excess oil. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Most dishes at Bangkok Garden are a variation on a simple formula: meat 
        and vegetables + sauce + rice or noodles. This Foodie's Pineapple Chicken 
        did not arrive in a pineapple shell as promised; nevertheless, its sweet 
        and spicy flavors were well balanced and the vegetables were fresh. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Creamy curries were most popular among the group for their subtle flavor 
        and smooth sauce consistency. Some sauces that dress the previously mentioned 
        &quot;Bangkok Garden Formula&quot; were cloudy and thick, not clear and 
        brothy as desired. Once tasted, the Foodies recognized those dishes' freshness, 
        yet the food did have a glazed, day-old appearance.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Be prepared to take some of the meal back to your dorm. Portions seem 
        reasonable in their shallow bowls, but accompanying rice extends the number 
        of servings each dish supplies. If one is desperate for Thai food, visit 
        Bangkok Garden. Remember, however, that Thanksgiving is only two weeks 
        away; and if you are returning home to a favorite Thai food vendor, wait 
        until you get there to sink your teeth into authentic Thai cuisine. <br>
