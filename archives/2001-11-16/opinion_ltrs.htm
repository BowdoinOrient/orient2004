      </p>
      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>I am writing to respond to the letter (Nov. 9) &quot;Tighter security 
        needed at the library&quot; and to clarify details related to the theft 
        of a student's laptop computer, in the Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, on 
        November 2nd. Library staff are trained to refer to a handbook of written 
        procedures during emergency situations. The students on duty correctly 
        followed procedures: they called Security. Security repeatedly has instructed 
        staff never to try to apprehend the perpetrators of a crime, but instead 
        to call Security. Subsequently, due to the information provided by library 
        staff and the students involved, two individuals were apprehended and 
        the laptop was recovered. The library is a very public building, and we 
        urge all students never to leave laptops or any valuables unattended in 
        the library or any other public location, even when they vacate a carrel 
        just for a few moments to get a drink of water or to consult the catalog. 
        We also have had telephones installed on each level of the Hubbard stacks. 
        If you are in Hubbard and feel Security needs to be contacted, use the 
        phone and call Security; do not take the time to walk back to the Circulation 
        Desk on the main level of H-L. We welcome suggestions for how we may increase 
        security. Please be assured that maintaining security and safety in the 
        library is a chief concern of every library staff member.</p>
      <p>Thanks again for your concerns.</p>

      <p><font size="5">Questioning the slander of Bowdoin atheletes</font></p>
      <p>As students at Bowdoin we are all a part of a special and unique community 
        that will never again be duplicated for the rest of our lives. We all 
        have our own individual reasons for coming to Brunswick, but each one 
        of us-intentionally or not-have become Polar Bears. The community that 
        each one of us has worked to establish revolves around mutual support, 
        academic integrity, and social honor. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As students here, we have a common respect and admiration for each other, 
        and for each individual accomplishment that our peers have made, whether 
        it is on the playing field, in the classroom, in the theater, through 
        music, or in student government. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In a school that brags about having more that two-thirds of its student 
        body playing a varsity sport, we feel that sports should not be something 
        that is frowned upon. Athletic teams and athletes do not serve to divide 
        the student body: rather they unite us. Sporting events are a great medium 
        for showing school spirit. It is in few places that school spirit is as 
        deep or as evident as it is at a big game versus one of our distinguished 
        rivals. For years this has been the trend at Bowdoin. Ted Maloney, an 
        orient staff writer, from three years ago, wrote: &quot;What makes the 
        student section of home hockey games great is that for a couple of hours, 
        a diverse cross section of the Bowdoin community actually comes together 
        for one common cause&quot;. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As members of the Student Athletic Advisory Committee, we felt that publishing 
        an article in the <i>Orient</i> on Parent's Weekend (the most widely circulated 
        issue that the <i>Orient</i> puts out) claiming that athletes at Bowdoin 
        are far below the acceptable lines of admission and that they do not perform 
        up to the academic standards of the college was not only a slap in the 
        face to the hundreds of student-athletes at Bowdoin, but also a smear 
        against the institution and community that we all value as Polar Bears. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>While we do not endorse the idea of greatly lowering standards to admit 
        athletes, we feel that athletic contributions should be very important 
        in the admissions arena because athletics are the strongest unifying force 
        that our school has. Bowdoin College is a school that prides itself on 
        a well-rounded student body. It is a school that wants students to feel 
        its &quot;resources behind them in whatever task&quot; they undertake; 
        &quot;to make hosts of friends who are leaders in all walks of life.&quot; 
        We believe that Bowdoin should strive for perfection in every task that 
        it undertakes, including sports. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As athletes, we would be happy to know that, as a school, we have the 
        privilege to have the number one pianist in the country. Our admissions 
        office should look for a well-rounded student body; we should have talented 
        athletes, great actors, exemplary leaders and good physicists alike. Raising 
        the standards for an already extremely difficult admissions process for 
        student-athletes would only prevent us from reaching the standards of 
        national excellence that we already have achieved in the academic arena, 
        thereby stripping our community of the most powerful unifying force that 
        Bowdoin has to offer - successful sports teams. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Our opinion as a committee is simple. Be happy that your squash team 
        is going to be competing for the national championship every year, smile 
        knowing that we have one of the best theater departments in the country, 
        and celebrate over the fact that the leaders of tomorrow are working hard 
        in our student government. If Bowdoin is lacking in other areas of student 
        interest, such as the music department, let's work hard to improve the 
        resources and participation in that department, but not at the expense 
        of the time-honored athletic department. We must unite together, not divide, 
        as students, artists, faculty, and athletes alike to promote the greatest 
        well being of the college. </p>
      <p>Written by Marshall Mclean and Michael Taylor, class of 2002, on behalf 
        of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee.</p>
      <p><i>The Student Athlete Advisory Committee is lead by a group of seven 
        senior captains. The Committee is in charge of promoting the well being 
        of student athletes at Bowdoin through Spirit, Wellness and Community 
        Service. The committee has representatives from each class and every sport.
