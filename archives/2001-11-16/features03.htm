        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Where's the interpreter,&quot; you will remember a 
        Sergeant shouted as I arrived in Germany, a freshly baked GI, to be whisked 
        off to 8th Infantry Division headquarters at the pleasant spa town of 
        Bad Kreuznach. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My interpreting duties for the most part were confined to 
        accompanying the Commanding General when he made courtesy calls on civic 
        officials such as the Lord Mayor. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There were three CG's during my time with the Division. 
        One was called Moses, an odd name for a military man I thought, and the 
        other Goodpaster, even odder perhaps. Though junior in rank to many others 
        in line for the job, Goodpaster was made Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
        of Staff by President Kennedy. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Highly intelligent and urbane, Goodpaster had the genial 
        air of a college professor. Moses on the other hand was rather forbidding. 
        Before my first interpreting job for him I was told to sit next to the 
        chauffeur in the General's official car and wait for him running outside 
        the entrance of the headquarters building with the engine. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When Moses got in, the chauffeur said, looking at the General 
        in the rear mirror, Sir, this is Specialist Rang, the interpreter.&quot; 
        In reply, Moses mumbled something I didn't catch. That was all I got from 
        him beyond a curt &quot;Thank you, 'Specialist,'&quot; at the end. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodpaster was completely different. Calling me down to 
        his office he showed me the draft of a short talk he was to give during 
        Sunday services in the Post Chapel, also attended by German civilians. 
        He didn't want me to interpret he said but to translate it and teach him 
        how to say it in German. He couldn't have been nicer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yet another and altogether different type was General Rossen, 
        a &quot;soldier's soldier&quot; whom, at the beginning of the fateful 
        involvement of the US in the conflict between North and South Kennedy 
        made Chief of the Green Berets, the elite force acting in an &quot;advisory&quot; 
        capacity to the Armed Forces of South Vietnam. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My most interesting but also harrowing job was as interpreter 
        at a court martial. The defendant was a black paratrooper accused of having 
        raped a German girl, sitting a few paces from him with her mother and 
        their council, the prosecutor facing them. Sitting with the latter, I 
        had the panel of senior officers on my right. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was an embarrassing business. Council took the line that 
        though admitting attempted rape, the defendant had not actually achieved 
        penetration. This the girl strongly denied. Everything thus hinged on 
        what exactly constituted penetration, how many millimeters. There was 
        a lot of haggling about this. In the end, the accused was found guilty 
        and sentenced to 20 years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The sentence would of course be reviewed by higher judicial 
        authority in Washington and no doubt was aimed at local public opinion, 
        as much as anything else. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Had the court known of my predilection for blacks, I might 
        of course have been debarred as interpreter. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In spring '63 my army life and interpreting career came 
        to an end. Having requested an overseas discharge, I was determined to 
        make the most of the coming summer of freedom by traveling all over Europe 
        in my black beetle. <br>
        For a start I took my girlfriend Helga to England, while already thinking 
        of taking her back to America with me in the fall, married or not. But 
        somewhere along the line I got cold feet and the informal engagement was 
        off. I told Helga during a stop in Paris on the way back. She cried, but 
        not for long. A few weeks later she started going out with my brother 
        at Bonn. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He in turn bequeathed his former girlfriend to me, a sexy 
        blonde called Barbara. Told by him, I hadn't actually slept with Helga, 
        she tried her best to seduce me. We even spent a night together at a hotel. 
        But though finding Barbara extremely attractive, I didn't want to sleep 
        with her. Could I not at least undress her she said; she liked to be looked 
        at. Fool that I was, I said no. The opportunity didn't arise again, with 
        a different girl, for another five years, in San Francisco. With a different 
        outcome, this story will be the subject of a future installment. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I spent the rest of the summer at St. Tropez with two American 
        friends, a gay couple. One was called Redvers, black like my New York 
        friend Ronald (also spending the summer in Europe, though we only met 
        once), the other Bradley, scion of a Boston Brahmin family and an artist. 
        Brad painted portraits, of his friends mostly, in highly realistic fashion, 
        so real they looked almost like photographs. Tall and thin, with sallow 
        complexion and a mop of black hair, he looked every inch the artist and 
        liked dressing up in the fashion of the Belle &Eacute;poque, wearing extravagant 
        suits with colorful cravats, and a straw hat with ribbon. Shorter and 
        stockier than him, but with lovely skin the color of ebony, Redvers also 
        liked dressing up. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The two together really were a sight. Thus attired they 
        would dine with me, underdressed in comparison, at the most expensive 
        restaurants they could find. Fluent in French, Redvers did the ordering 
        while Bradley as a rule paid. Once however, I ended up paying for the 
        three of us gay musketeers, a horrendous bill. Served me right I suppose 
        for sponging off them.<br>
