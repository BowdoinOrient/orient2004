      <p>An unusually blunt speaker came to campus this week. Kevin Danaher is 
        the director of public education for Global Exchange, a nonprofit organization 
        in San Francisco that has a lot to say about a lot of left-wing causes. 
        Danaher intended to speak Wednesday about globalization and the negative 
        effects on the world's poor that Global Exchange considers sufficient 
        cause to rethink the value of globalization itself. But, like most occupants 
        of lecterns and pulpits these days, Danaher couldn't resist speaking at 
        length about the events of September 11. As one might expect, he was critical 
        of the military efforts underway in Afghanistan. </p>
      <p>Once he got around to discussing the problems of globalization, Danaher 
        was in fine form. There are plenty of government, economics, philosophy, 
        and history courses that deal in large or small part with this issue, 
        but Danaher is on the front lines, as it were, and Bowdoin students had 
        an unusual opportunity to hear their readings speak. Kresge was mostly 
        full of students taking advantage of that. Amateur videotapes of linguist 
        and leftist handyman Noam Chomsky were on sale outside the auditorium; 
        audience members made plans to travel to a demonstration at the Bush family 
        home in Kennebunkport. The political vibe of the evening was far, far 
        left, but it was more than a boilerplate recitation of progressive political 
        causes. Skeptics and sympathizers agreed that Danaher was, if nothing 
        else, earnest: he was aiming to convince his audience of things, not just 
        playing devil's advocate. It's a safe option, in many of our classes, 
        to do the opposite of what Danaher did, and try on intellectual arguments 
        gingerly, qualifying contributions with &quot;It could be argued that&#133;&quot; 
        or &quot;One could say&#133;&quot;. And it's a rare occasion when we hear 
        arguments from people who really believe in them. It is a mistake, when 
        such speakers come to Bowdoin or simply raise their hands to speak in 
        class, to dismiss them as blindly following the lines of argument we think 
        we've already read enough about. </p>
      <p>It so happens that there are two campus publications, recently revived 
        this semester, that offer students the opportunity to go out on a limb 
        and argue forcefully for the host of issues that Danaher spoke about. 
        His talk was arranged by the publishers of <i>The Disorient</i>; those 
        who disagree with him may find common cause at <i>The Patriot</i>'s offices. 
        These publications have the opportunity to play a huge part in any debates 
        about globalization that occur here. (They, and <i>The Orient</i>, also 
        have the opportunity to print articles about pretty much anything else 
        they want. Such are the joys of a free press.) The campus looks forward 
        to hearing from <i>The Disorient</i>, <i>The Patriot</i> and any other 
        student publications that may arise, as we heard from Kevin Danaher, more 
        than devil's advocacy.</p>
