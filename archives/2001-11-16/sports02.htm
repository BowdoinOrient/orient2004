      <p>After a season that seemed destined for greatness from its very outset, 
        the Bowdoin Men's Rugby Team fell 20-5 to Middlebury in the Northeast 
        Division II championship last weekend.<br>

      </table>
      <p>Despite the hard-fought defeat, Bowdoin finished its year ranked number 
        two in the Northeast. This is no small accomplishment considering that 
        just four years ago, Bowdoin Rugby considered a winning season to be a 
        call for celebration.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We've come a long way,&quot; explained longtime head coach Rick 
        Scala as he reflected upon the season from his spacious offices at the 
        Pickard Field Rugby Complex. &quot;A little over ten years ago, we were 
        at this level. That was before nationals came into being, so all you could 
        win was New Englands [a reference to the New England Tournament, in which 
        Bowdoin had a dramatic and victorious performance this year].<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It seemed we just didn't have the talent for a while,&quot; he 
        continued. &quot;But I knew things were going to change. Our current group 
        of seniors, who are about a dozen of the finest rugby players I've ever 
        had the privilege to know, coupled with our lightning-fast backs, have 
        put us back on top. I see a future paved with more championship seasons 
        for us.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The players seemed to know that the fall 2001 season was destined for 
        greatness. &quot;We took on our division (the Downeast Division) head-on,&quot; 
        said back captain Jason &quot;D'Nunzio&quot; Pietrafitta '02. &quot;We 
        charged over every team we encountered. There was never a doubt in anyone's 
        mind of our victory. Sure, we were a little undisciplined, but we made 
        up for that with unbridled fire and energy. Not even a brick wall could've 
        stopped us. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;For New Englands, we slowed it down a bit,&quot; he continued. 
        &quot;We steadily punched holes in the opposition until they couldn't 
        stand it anymore. For the Northeast, we combined that discipline with 
        our earlier fire to play at our peak.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>D'Nunzio's reflection was an accurate one. After Bowdoin crushed the 
        other five teams in its division (which includes Bates, the University 
        of Maine, and Colby Polytechnic Institute), the ruggers triumphantly advanced 
        through three postseason tests to land in the Northeast Final Four. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Joining Bowdoin in this elite tournament were Yale, the State University 
        of New York at Plattsburg, and Middlebury. It is a testament to the level 
        of competition that Bowdoin enjoys in its home union (the New England 
        Union) that three out of the four Northeast Championship teams were from 
        New England.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Bowdoin faced Plattsburg while Middlebury beat 
        up on Yale. The two packs collided in a series of crunches and audible 
        smacks in the game's opening seconds. Bowdoin's superior discipline shined 
        as the black pack was able to quickly master the ball and assert its dominance 
        over Plattsburg. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Kris &quot;Bucking Bronco Buster&quot; Bosse and junior Dave &quot;Tomb 
        Raider&quot; Kirkland delivered powerful hits that sent their opponents 
        reeling. This allowed the ball to be moved out to Bowdon's legendary and 
        lethal backs. As hundreds of raucous Bowdoin fans shrieked and yelled 
        (a fleet of buses had left Bowdoin earlier in the day, provided by the 
        always-supportive Athletic Department in recognition of rugby as the school's 
        premier sporting team), the lightning quickness of scrumhalf Matty &quot;The 
        Patriarch&quot; Stanton '02, Nick &quot;Greaseball&quot; Reid '05, and 
        Rob &quot;Capt. Brown Star&quot; Mandle '02 came to the fore. <br>
      </p>
      <p>They ran right through every Plattsburg defender with amazing dexterity. 
        Coupled with the destructive hits of D'Nunzio, there was no stopping the 
        backs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Plattsburg managed rally in the second half, however. Not to be outdone, 
        and claiming that some Plattsburg players had &quot;messed with his hair, 
        and no one is allowed to do that,&quot; Dennis &quot;Leo&quot; Kiley '03 
        slammed through the Plattsburg defenders to win the game for Bowdoin, 
        17-13.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That night, the grateful people of Springfield, Massachusetts, gave a 
        feast in honor of Bowdoin. Though details are sketchy as to the debauchery 
        that flowed within, a clandestine report has surfaced regarding the behavior 
        of the family of Shane &quot;Head&quot; O'Neill '02. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Shane's kid brother, Rory &quot;The Tea-Totaling Leprechaun&quot; livened 
        up the evening with his maturity and wit. In a speech to the team, the 
        Leprechaun closed with these stirring words:<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I know you can win, boys. But you must give your heart. You must 
        give your soul. You must die. Die!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Upon hearing these inspiring words, Shane's cousin Ryan immediately decided 
        to join the team. It was also rumored that Bosse's little brother, Whit 
        Schrader '05, awoke the next morning looking like &quot;someone had attacked 
        his neck with a vacuum cleaner.&quot; This can neither be confirmed nor 
        denied, as Schrader has been sporting a turtleneck all week. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The next day, as snow clouds menaced over the Berkshires, the men assembled 
        to face Middlebury for the championship. No one expected an easy match, 
        but the team didn't know just how much of a struggle it would face.<br>
        Not only would the icy, up-to-40mph wind gusts neutralize a key component 
        of Bowdoin's offense (Capt. Brown Star's kicking), but there were other 
        handicaps as well. Middlebury's active international recruitment program 
        has filled its back row with boys who have played rugby their whole lives, 
        meaning that Bowdoin faced a backline of comparable quality.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The game started out well. As senior forward captain Billy &quot;Cold 
        Intensity&quot; Soares's pack laid into the Middlebury boys, Bowdoin established 
        a firm setting on the field. The first half was a constant battle as the 
        two sides warred back and forth across the pitch. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the second half, however, things took a turn for the worse. The referee's 
        seeing-eye dog ran away, leading to an almost comical series of calls 
        against Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A Boston Irish Wolfhounds coach, who was at the tournament to scout for 
        talent, said it best. &quot;I've played rugby for thirty-five years, and 
        I've played in and coached international matches,&quot; he said. &quot;That 
        has to be some of the most piss-poor officiating I've ever seen.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Don D'Nunzio's Consuleri recorded 7 penalties called on Bowdoin for every 
        one against Middlebury. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;That ref will never walk again,&quot; D'Nunzio vowed from the sidelines. 
        &quot;Nobody messes with my boy.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This officiating disadvantage, coupled with the skill of Middlebury's 
        backs, made it only a matter of time before the Panthers broke through. 
        Late in the second half, they did just that, scoring a quick succession 
        of tries. After an hour and a half of brutal, tight, back-and-forth rugby, 
        Middlebury managed to edge out the lads in black, 20-5.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though disappointed with a finished season, the ruggers are still upbeat, 
        and rightly so. &quot;Look, we're number two in the Northeast,&quot; said 
        an exhausted Soares after the match. &quot;That's pretty damn good. All 
        I can say is that Middlebury better be careful, because we're coming back 
        here next year and we'll beat them. Heck, we'll beat whoever comes out 
        against us.&quot; GO BLACK<br>
