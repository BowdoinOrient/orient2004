      <p> <i>Morning View</i>, Incubus's third major-label debut, is a diamond 
        in the rough. At a time when the hard-rock scene is populated with whiny, 
        bland groups like Korn and Papa Roach, this album is a breath of fresh 
        air. The record combines the scratching of DJ Kilmore with hard-driving 
        riffs and excellent songwriting to create a brilliant end product.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

      </table>
      <p>The album deserves all of the hype it has generated. One can listen to 
        it from start to finish without skipping a single track, and the songs 
        are consistently interesting and well-written. It has a nice mix of slow 
        and acoustic songs in addition to fast-paced, heavier ones. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Standout tracks include &quot;11 a.m.,&quot; &quot;Blood On The Ground,&quot; 
        &quot;Mexico,&quot; and &quot;Circles.&quot; The beauty of these tracks 
        is that each one is quite different musically, yet each have insightful 
        lyrics. For instance, in &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; lead singer Brandon 
        Boyd waxes poetic: &quot;I bite my tongue every time you come around, 
        cause/ blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Incubus may not be the most talented band out there, but what they lack 
        in skill, they make up for with passion. Boyd is a versatile singer who 
        is just as comfortable yelling at the top of his lungs as he is singing 
        soft high notes for acoustic ballads. He is also one of the few songwriters 
        in his genre who can write lyrics that are both emotional and intelligent 
        at the same time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The album is quite diverse in terms of its sound. &quot;Mexico&quot; 
        is a slow acoustic song that will bring tears to your eyes, while &quot;Nice 
        To Know You&quot; is an edgier electric song that will get hearts pumping.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The album's one main flaw is its lack of innovation as compared to past 
        Incubus albums. The band's first independent release featured funk music 
        reminiscent of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and their second release, <i>S.C.I.E.N.C.E.</i>, 
        was a breakthrough work that combined surprisingly heavy riffs with creative 
        turntable work. Their most recent release was not as creative as the previous 
        two, but it incorporated the DJ into the songs much better. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On <i>Morning View</i>, the DJ's effects add to the music on the few 
        songs when they are noticeable, but they seem somewhat forced. The release 
        would have been close to perfect if Kilmore's scratching talents were 
        utilized better.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With that said, this album is still more creative than most of the drivel 
        getting played on MTV these days. &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; for 
        instance, sounds more like a track you would hear in Asia than one produced 
        by a mainstream American rock band. Eastern strings, combined with Boyd's 
        excellent vocals, create a touching song that is almost eight minutes 
        long. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While Incubus may now be considered mainstream, few bands have the creativity 
        to write such an album, let alone pull it off successfully.<br>
      </p>
