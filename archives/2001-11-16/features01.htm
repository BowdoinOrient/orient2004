      <p align="left">As America headed towards the fateful presidential election 
        of 1860, an amazing amount of hostility was in the air. Northerners and 
        Southerners blamed the opposite side for everything. There was even name 
        calling in the Senate. Stephen A. Douglas, Democratic Senator from Illinois, 
        known as the Little Giant, opponent to Lincoln in a number of famous debates, 
        spear-header of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and champion of the popular sovereignty 
        idea, was a known enemy of Republican Senator William Pitt Fessenden of 
        the Bowdoin class of 1823. When Douglas lashed out at the Republicans, 
        Fessenden responded.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We call ourselves 'Republicans,'&quot; Pitt Fessenden 
        thundered, &quot;the senator from Illinois never speaks of us without 
        calling us 'Black Republicans;' &#133;the senator never speaks of us without 
        calling us 'Abolitionists.' &#133; If gentlemen call themselves Democrats, 
        I call them so&#133;it only shows that there are individuals in the Senate 
        who forget the first principles recognized between gentlemen and attempt 
        to eke out an argument by affixing names upon persons or parties.&quot;<br>
        Fessenden also went on to fight against Southern bullying in the Senate. 
        When Democrats accused Republicans of being abolitionists and &quot;agitation,&quot; 
        Fessenden responded, &quot;If we are disposed to be quiet you call us 
        craven; we are afraid to speak, we have not spirit enough to protect or 
        defend ourselves. If we speak out, we are agitators and desire to rake 
        open the coals of discord throughout this great country.&quot; By that 
        he meant simply, what else do you expect us to do?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For years the Democrats with their strong Southern base 
        had fought hard at keeping the North silent. The threat of disunion had 
        been so incomprehensible that the Northerners had been forced for decades 
        to fight a retreating battle. Now however, new crimes against the fundamental 
        rights of human beings and free government - namely the strengthening 
        of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 and the caning of Massachusetts Senator 
        Charles Sumner - stirred up new vigor in the North. It was only a matter 
        of time before the Potomac and the Ohio Rivers became barriers between 
        a nation at war with itself.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the years of 1857 to 1859 Fessenden would hotly debate 
        a number of bills in the Senate. One of those was the Lecompton Constitution, 
        drawn up by Southern sympathizers from Kansas who hoped to bring the state 
        into the Union as a slave-holding one. Another issue was one that involved 
        the expansion of the army. Fessenden and most of the Republicans opposed 
        this for both ideological and financial reasons. By that time Fessenden 
        had been placed on the Senate Finance Committee and for the remainder 
        of his career, he would be employed here (aside from a brief stint as 
        the Secretary of the Treasury).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the meantime, however, his duels with hotheaded Southerners 
        continued. Fessenden would wrestle words with Robert Toombs of Georgia 
        and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi. Coincidentally (and later to the great 
        embarrassment of Bowdoin College) in 1858 Davis, a former Secretary of 
        War and soon to be the first and only President of the Confederate States 
        of America, received an honorary degree from Bowdoin College. The biggest 
        criminal of the time, as far as Fessenden was concerned, was President 
        James Buchanan. Referring to Buchanan's cabinet Fessenden wrote, &quot;A 
        more inferior looking set of men, including their chief, I never saw together. 
        Most of them are not only ordinary, but positively ugly. They are, in 
        fact, very mean men, having a very small degree of talent among them, 
        and I fear very little integrity&#133;&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Without the vigor of youth in his blood, (by this time Fessenden 
        was nearing fifty years of age and Washington life had always wounded 
        his health) Fessenden awaited the coming of the War. Tragedy would strike 
        him in 1857 when his wife of a quarter of a century passed away. Fessenden 
        buried himself in work to block out the pain. True, the senator's sons 
        could probably have eased his suffering, but they were all growing up 
        and he suffered his sadness in silence. In 1858 Fessenden wrote:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>I have no daughters, and my sons will soon leave me on 
        their several paths of life. What is to become of me if I live to old 
        age? It is to be hoped that I shall not. But it is useless to anticipate. 
        I will meet the events and changes of life as well as I can and try to 
        retain my manhood until the curtain falls.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile at Fessenden's alma mater, Thomas Worchester Hyde 
        was at the peak of his college career. In early 1859 the Bath native wrote 
        about physical rigorousness. In it Hyde described how British society 
        was ideal because of its combination of physical and academic disciplines. 
        Hyde wrote:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>The greatest need of the present generation is Physical 
        Training&#133;The great fundamental principle, that by exercise all our 
        faculties are improved, should always be born in mind. The intellect, 
        if it is not constantly kept at work, takes a backward path&#133;.We spend 
        a large portion of out lives in discipline of knowledge&#133;but do we 
        make a corresponding advance in our physical nature to support the straining 
        operation&#133;.It is devoutly to be hoped that&#133;Americans may emphatically 
        become a healthy people.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And so, while the nation prepared for civil war and as William 
        Pitt Fessenden wrestled with the effects of loneliness in the Senate, 
        a young and enthusiastic Thomas Hyde was busily arguing for more exercise 
        in American culture.<br>
