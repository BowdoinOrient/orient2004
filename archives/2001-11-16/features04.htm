        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD, 
        and am wrestling with whether I want to take the Adderall my doctor prescribed. 
        There are lots of rumors around, and I'm trying to separate fact from 
        fiction. S.H.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear S.H.: &quot;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&quot; 
        is a neuropsychiatric disorder, characterized by inattention, impulsivity, 
        and hyperactivity. These behavioral deficits cause problems which are 
        performance-based, rather than skill-based. Although students with ADHD 
        are of at least average, if not above average intelligence, and certainly 
        possess their fair share of talents and abilities, 25 to 35 percent fail 
        to graduate high school. Young adults with ADHD also have a six-fold increased 
        risk of developing substance abuse problems.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">ADHD is a chronic, life-long disorder, usually appearing 
        first in childhood. It may affect as many as 3 to 5 percent of Americans, 
        and 1 to 3 percent of college students. ADHD can be difficult to diagnose, 
        and many experts feel that it is both over-diagnosed (especially in highly 
        active, slow-learning boys) and under-diagnosed (in inattentive but quiet 
        girls). A high percentage of people with ADHD also have a learning disorder, 
        and complete neuropsychological or educational-psychological evaluation 
        should be undertaken for anyone diagnosed with ADHD.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Stimulant medications (e.g. Ritalin and Dexedrine) remain 
        the primary therapy for ADHD. They modulate levels of the neurotransmitter 
        dopamine, and in so doing, are thought to decrease neurologic &quot;white 
        noise&quot; from competing centers of the brain, facilitating focus and 
        concentration on central tasks. They are now available in a variety of 
        short- and long-acting preparations. The newer products are being marketed 
        directly to consumers, sometimes with confusing results.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="75" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="left">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/features01_ritalin.jpg" width="75" height="141"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Ritalin.</font></td>

      </table>
      <p align="left">Standard methylphenidate (&quot;Ritalin&quot;) lasts only 
        3 - 5 hours, and is usually taken in multiple daytime doses. An older 
        sustained release formulation (&quot;Ritalin-SR&quot;) lasts 6 - 8 hours, 
        but has a slow onset of action. &quot;Metadate CD&quot;, the newest formulation, 
        has the same 8 hour duration, but contains both immediate- and extended-release 
        components, peaking first at 1.5 hours, and then again at 4.5 hours. &quot;Concerta&quot; 
        tablets contain both an immediate-release coating of medication, and an 
        osmotic pump which gradually releases the remainder of the drug over a 
        12 hour period. Concerta tablet shells are not digested, and leave the 
        GI tract as empty &quot;ghost&quot; shells.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Typical monthly costs of the four preparations range from 
        $32 to $70, respectively.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Standard dextroamphetamine (&quot;Dexedrine&quot;) is as 
        effective as methylphenidate in treating ADHD, and has about a 5 hour 
        duration. Extended-release &quot;Dexedrine Spansules&quot; last about 
        8 hours. &quot;Adderall&quot; contains a mixture of amphetamines, lasts 
        only 4 -5 hours, and so is best taken in two daily doses. A sustained-release 
        formulation (&quot;Adderall XR&quot;) is on its way, and will surely be 
        advertised in magazines and on TV. The amphetamine preparations all cost 
        about $25 per month.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of these medications are controlled substances. The 
        shorter-acting stimulants are readily abused for recreational purposes, 
        and are all known to be frequently traded among friends as &quot;study 
        aids&quot;. At the University of Wisconsin, one in five students reported 
        misusing this medication. At Bowdoin, this may be equally common.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Headache, abdominal pain, appetite suppression, insomnia 
        and nervous tics are all common side effects of stimulants. Taken orally, 
        in prescribed doses, stimulants are safe and effective medications. Rarely, 
        in people with predispositions to seizure disorders or cardiac problems, 
        they can be dangerous, even fatal. This is especially true when they are 
        snorted.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many &quot;natural&quot; products are also promoted for 
        ADHD, including essential fatty acids, phosphatidylserine, ginkgo, DMAE, 
        and Ephedra. None have been scientifically proven to be effective. And 
        remember: &quot;natural&quot; doesn't necessarily mean safe.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A balanced, healthful diet and regularly scheduled exercise, 
        on the other hand, can be very helpful for someone with ADHD. Compensatory 
        strategies for structuring studies and organizing activities are also 
        effective. Bowdoin students can find assistance in developing these strategies 
        at the Baldwin Center. Joann Canning, Director of Accomodations for Students 
        with Disabilities, can help coordinate these efforts. Providers at the 
        Counseling Center can help students deal with the feelings of inadequacy, 
        stress and frustration that often come with ADHD. And last, but by no 
        means least, the student support group FORWARD! welcomes all to attend 
        their Wednesday evening meetings in Moulton Union.<br>
