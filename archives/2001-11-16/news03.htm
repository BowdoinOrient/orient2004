      <p align="left">Think that the good old &quot;Bowdoin bubble&quot; is as 
        safe and secure as it sounds? Guess again. Recent security reports show 
        that incidents of crime on campus have occured more frequently this year 
        than last, including the theft of many valuable student possessions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This semester has seen 27 reports of lost or stolen items, 
        a figure that includes all incidents classified as thefts (including things 
        like the inadvertent dropping of wallets which are later recovered).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Five laptops and seven bicycles have been reported missing 
        this fall. Other items include medication, a surfboard, wallets, purses, 
        jackets, a Domino's Pizza sign, and a Snapple.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The 27 reports compare to the 16 that were filed by this 
        time last year. Assistant Director of Security Michael Brown said that 
        since 2001-2002 numbers are already higher, campus theft may be a noteworthy 
        problem: &quot;I have seen enough to be concerned,&quot;he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Three laptops were taken in 1999, and two last year. &quot;We're 
        already looking at five this year; that's alarming,&quot; Brown said. 
        &quot;By virtue of their portability, they're a real attractive target 
        for thieves. The increase in thefts is very disturbing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Brown, there is no apparent link between the 
        laptop disappearances. &quot;In one case it was from a public location, 
        another...through an open window [in Moore Hall], another was taken with 
        some other items from a vehicle,&quot; Brown said. &quot;Thus far, we 
        haven't been able to draw a connection between the thefts.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After some collaborative detective work, Security was able 
        to recover one of the five stolen computers. Three male individuals, who 
        were described as in their mid- to late teens, are being interviewed in 
        connection with the theft. Two of the young men live in Brunswick, while 
        the other resides in Gardiner, where the computer was recovered.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Brown said that interviews with the three suspects may shed 
        some light on other incidents at the College. &quot;They appear to be 
        connected with other thefts on campus,&quot; he said. &quot;We're looking 
        at charges of larceny, accessory to larceny, and maybe...possession of 
        stolen property.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's security office now contains an investigative 
        unit, with new resources. &quot;We now have the ability to lift latent 
        fingerprints and prepare composite sketches,&quot; Brown said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When it was reported that three suspicious persons were 
        in the library, Security was able to use a student's description in its 
        hunt for suspects. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We prepared a composite sketch of one of the individuals 
        with the information [provided by the student] and forwarded a copy to 
        the Brunswick Police Department, who recognized the individual and identified 
        the other people [involved],&quot; he continued.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;In this case, it was the student's information that 
        helped us get the computer back. It was great team effort.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Security has hopes to locate the other stolen computers 
        as well. &quot;We're still looking into the others; all four cases are 
        active and open,&quot; Brown said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another common problem on the Bowdoin campus is bicycle 
        theft. According to Brown, six have been reported as stolen this fall. 
        &quot;We always have a certain number of bikes taken,&quot; he said. &quot;We 
        have actually recovered three bikes in the last few days.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At this point last year, Security had received reports of 
        six bicycle thefts, a number identical to this year's figure.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Brown said that getting the Bowdoin Security ID sticker 
        is a helpful step toward protecting a bike. &quot;If it's recovered, we 
        can get in touch with you much faster,&quot; he said. &quot;There are 
        a certain number that are taken and not reported, so we encourage people 
        to file a report.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Brown, students should keep laptops and other 
        valuables in a secure location. If in fact students find their belongings 
        missing, or they see something suspicious, they should contact Security 
        (x3314). &quot;I encourage students to contact us,&quot; Brown said. &quot;If 
        something doesn't look right, give us a call.&quot;<br>
