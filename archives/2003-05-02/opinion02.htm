      <p align="left"><font size="5">Who are we to condemn Cuba?<br>
        <font size="2">KATHERINE CRANE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> At the U.N. Human Rights Commission election on Wednesday, 
        the U.S. stomped out in a huff. Cuba had just been re-elected to the commission, 
        and to the American representatives, this was the supreme indication that 
        the Human Rights commission had nothing to do with human rights.</p>
      <p>Sichan Siv, the ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social Council, explained 
        that &quot;it was an outrage for us because we view Cuba as the worst 
        violator of human rights in this hemisphere.&quot; Siv walked out when 
        he heard Cuba's election being announced. He then walked back in again, 
        so that he could make the same grand gesture when the Cuban representative 
        began his speech.</p>
      <p>Since Cuba was most recently in the news for jailing 78 dissidents and 
        executing three people who tried to hijack a ferry, the American reaction 
        to the election is entirely reasonable and even necessary. The problem 
        is that America's relationship with Cuba is a little like that of a small-time 
        pot dealer with the cocaine dealers who overrun his neighborhood. He may 
        disapprove on principle of selling crack to children, but he is also aware 
        that their presence makes his own lawbreaking less visible.</p>
      <p>The U.S. can safely criticize Cuban human rights violations, since the 
        American military base at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, where many of our human 
        rights violations take place, is out of Cuban control. America's lease 
        of Guant&aacute;namo can only be cancelled by the agreement of both governments. 
        Since the Cuban means of protesting our presence in their country is to 
        tear up our rent checks, we now pay nothing for using the base.</p>
      <p>Guant&aacute;namo has an asset greater than cheapness, however, and that 
        is the fact that it is Cuban. The U.S. now has several hundred terror 
        suspects held in prisons on the base. The suspects were captured by Americans 
        and are imprisoned and interrogated by Americans, but because they are 
        not actually on American soil, they do not have the rights the Constitution 
        normally gives to suspected criminals.</p>
      <p>The U.S. military swears that the suspects have been treated according 
        to international law and have not been tortured. However, in a front-page 
        New York Times article from March 9, American officials acknowledged that 
        they regularly use &quot;sleep and light deprivation and the temporary 
        withholding of food, water, access to sunlight, and medical attention.&quot; 
        In fact, this means holding prisoners in windowless cells that are constantly 
        lighted to prevent sleep, starving them or varying their meal times to 
        disorient them, allowing them the eight hours of sleep that international 
        law stipulates but not allowing those hours to be consecutive, forcing 
        them to remain in uncomfortable positions for long periods of time, and 
        varying the temperature between 10 degrees and 100.</p>
      <p align="left">
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        At Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, where prisoners are threatened with 
        transfer to Guant&aacute;namo, two prisoners have died by what remarkably 
        honest doctors judged to be homicide. When the Times article came out, 
        the cause of the deaths was still under investigation.</p>
      <p>At Guantanamo, where the prisoners are sorted according to the level 
        of threat they pose, the article reported twenty suicide attempts. A picture 
        from last year showed an unconscious suspect being wheeled back to his 
        cell on a stretcher after an interrogation.</p>
      <p>The U.S. is right that electing Cuba to the U.N. Human Rights Commission 
        is ridiculous given the country's record. But what is not only ridiculous, 
        but also the height of hypocrisy, is the position the Americans have assumed 
        as the world's watchdogs of human rights.</p>
