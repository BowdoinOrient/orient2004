        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As I revealed in a column last year (April 12, 2002), I 
        am a lover of British church music. One of my favorite hymns is called 
        &quot;Hail Gladdening Light&quot; by Charles Wood. The eponymous subject 
        in the hymn is Jesus. The hymn speaks of Him as being &quot;Holiest of 
        holies&quot; and then shifts its focus to the &quot;sun's hour of rest.&quot; 
        The piece is in essence an affirmation of the light of God's love, as 
        the light of nature comes to its end and the uncertainty of darkness begins. 
        Though it is not the point of the hymn, I find that light can also carry 
        secular symbolism that is hopeful and inspirational as graduation, and 
        its inherent uncertainty, approaches.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As some may know from their prospective-student tour, Bowdoin's symbol 
        is the sun-the provider of light. I know of two reasons for this. The 
        commonly known reason is that we are historically the eastern-most college 
        in the United States, and hence, the first to see the sun rise in the 
        morning. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, we cannot divorce Bowdoin's symbol from the time period in which 
        the College was founded: the Enlightenment. Bowdoin received its charter 
        in 1794, a year that falls only five years after historian Peter Gay declared 
        the Enlightenment's conclusion. In the Enlightenment, symbols of light 
        represented the power of knowledge and concepts that we continue to expand: 
        scientific discoveries, classical political liberalism, Constitutional 
        government, and religious toleration all come to mind. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If one thinks of Bowdoin's light as being the total of those values and 
        spirits that we acquire in our time here, then this past week allowed 
        me many moments to think about the enduring memories and lessons of Bowdoin. 
        I see all of the parts of this weekend's experiences as being elements 
        of the aggregate Bowdoin Light; that which I hope remains active within 
        me forever. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Last Thursday, I attended a YALP dinner and reception with students, administration, 
        and alumni. As someone about to embark on &quot;the real world,&quot; 
        it was refreshing to see many alumni who are eager to give back to the 
        College. These were men and women of different ages and backgrounds, but 
        they all shared a palpable spirit of community that brought them together 
        in support of Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This weekend I participated in the festivities of Ivies Weekend. It may 
        seem strange to speak equally of an urbane and restrained dinner and an 
        unbridled and Dionysian weekend. However, in Ivies Weekend I find a spirit 
        of collegiality and camaraderie that I believe has value. We come together 
        in support of athletic teams, charities, and college bands. We gather 
        with our friends and socialize for more than a day. For those who can 
        keep the drinking to moderate levels, it is indeed an emancipating weekend 
        and one that tends to leave the student here with many positive memories. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Earlier this week, I witnessed Chris Hill's '74 acceptance speech for 
        the Hargraves Prize for the &quot;Preservation of Freedom.&quot; Listening 
        to his remarks, one could indeed sense the permanent light of the spirit 
        of the Common Good-a spirit that is beneficent and magnanimous. It is 
        inspirational to meet a man who is both so accomplished and so humble. 
        It is clear from his life that he has shown much courage and skill in 
        promoting America's ideals in his work in the Foreign Service. However, 
        he still remembers his roots to the point that he stopped one of his speeches 
        here, mid-sentence, to acknowledge his college roommate sitting in the 
        audience. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I see these three spirits: that of community, collegiality, and the Common 
        Good as resulting in the aggregate spirit of endless learning that our 
        symbol of light ultimately represents. I suspect the most important lesson 
        that we will all acquire while here is the inadequacy of humans to solve 
        all of the mysteries that life presents us. Tocqueville once wrote of 
        Pascal that the great 17th Century French philosopher and mathematician 
        died of old age at 39, because he tried to solve all of the mysteries 
        of the world. This anecdote illustrates the Sisyphean situation that Bowdoin 
        leaves us with: We must always ask questions and we will never find ultimate 
        answers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, we should look at this conundrum optimistically. To know that 
        our learning is enduring is also to know that our possibilities for exploration 
        will never be extinguished. I cannot help but think of what my priest 
        once told me when I was younger. He quoted his own college philosophy 
        professor who once told him &quot;the truth shuts your mind.&quot; Four 
        years of college makes me think this professor was right.</p>
      <p align="left">
        To know that answers remain to thousands of problems is inspirational. 
        That fact alone means that the talents of everyone in my class will find 
        good use. I look forward to returning to reunions and seeing the accomplishments 
        of everyone in my class. The anticipation of that moment is a reminder 
        to me that the spirits and lessons of Bowdoin are permanent. Its light 
        is indeed gladdening.</p>
