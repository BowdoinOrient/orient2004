        <font size="2">J.P. BOX</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Did you enjoy the NFL meat market? For months prior to the 
        2003 draft, self-appointed &quot;experts&quot; poked, prodded, tested, 
        and pried into the backgrounds of college's best and brightest football 
        stars. After sifting through these prospects as if they were racehorses 
        groomed for the Kentucky Derby, NFL execs gathered to draft the future 
        of their respective franchises.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you're upset that your team failed to address its needs in the draft, 
        you need not look any further than the setup of the meat market. You see, 
        scouts are great at recording 40-yard dash times and bench press reps, 
        but they fail to grasp the bigger picture. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I mean, seriously, how often do you see a defensive tackle take off and 
        run 40 yards during a game? And are running backs ever required to bench 
        press at midfield? Although these activities are good measures of speed 
        and upper body strength, they do not directly translate into on-the-field 
        production.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Nevertheless, the obsession with clocking, measuring, and objectifying 
        the abilities of college stars has become the norm in the draft. During 
        the first two rounds, teams take the &quot;best available athlete,&quot; 
        often times regardless of team needs and the current nature of the league.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Let's start with the Cincinnati Bengals drafting Carson Palmer with the 
        first overall pick, thus guaranteeing two more losing seasons under a 
        struggling young quarterback. Palmer is a big QB at 6'5&quot; and 232 
        pounds and runs a respectable 4.8 in the 40-yard dash. After throwing 
        13 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 2001, Palmer exploded his senior 
        season with 32 TDs and only ten picks.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although first-year head coach Marvin Lewis lobbied for Kansas State cornerback 
        Terrance Newman, team officials pushed for the prototypical All-American 
        QB. Forgetting that the franchise failed to groom Akili Smith into a NFL-quality 
        quarterback, the Bengals selected the fourth best quarterback in the draft 
        with the first pick. As a reward, Smith and Palmer will soon be the most 
        overpaid number two and three signal-callers in the league.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Jacksonville Jaguars ended up getting the best QB in the draft with 
        the number seven pick. Marshall's Byron Leftwich was passed over by six 
        teams because of supposed &quot;chronic shin&quot; problems and slow feet. 
        In 2001, Leftwich played half the season with a stress fracture in his 
        shin but managed to throw 38 touchdowns with only seven picks. During 
        the 2002 season, his production dropped off only slightly to 30 and ten.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In five years, Leftwich will be the best young quarterback in the league 
        outside of Michael Vick. Why? He had the edge over Palmer in terms of 
        intangibles, including leadership, courage under fire, and a will to win. 
        However, these qualities are less significant to NFL scouts than arbitrary 
        physical tests and &quot;objective&quot; statistics.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The most baffling pick of the draft, however, has to go to the Buffalo 
        Bills who selected running back Willis McGahee with the twenty-third pick. 
        After signing Travis Henry (a 1400-yard rusher in 2002) to a multi-year 
        contract and signing Olandis Gary during the off-season, Buffalo drafted 
        the Hurricanes' star after an impressive weight lifting, running, and 
        jumping display at the combine.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the team has glaring holes that need to be filled on the offensive 
        and defensive lines, the Bills gambled on McGahee's health despite already 
        having two capable running backs. After tearing three tendons in his knee 
        four months ago, the Bills are still uncertain how his surgically reconstructed 
        knee will respond to the grind of NFL play. Nevertheless, he was the &quot;best 
        athlete available&quot; at the twenty-third pick.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the NFL, however, athleticism only goes so far. The game's most feared 
        and talented linebacker, Ray Lewis, runs a slow time in the 40-yard dash. 
        If he were a college prospect with his 4.8 time, he would drop to the 
        second or third round. As a NFL linebacker, Lewis doesn't need to excel 
        in the 40-yard dash. His excellent vision and ability to fend off would-be 
        blockers makes him one of the game's greatest defensive players.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Or how about some of the NFL's all-time greats? Terrell Davis, a 1996 
        sixth-round draft choice with only average speed and strength, dominated 
        the league for four seasons before a slew of injuries cut his career short. 
        Relying on uncanny field vision and surprising acceleration, Davis broke 
        the 2000-yard plateau in 1998 while averaging 5.1 yards-per-carry.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Drafted in the third round of the 1979 draft, Joe Montana was never supposed 
        to become one of the best signal-callers in NFL history. Despite building 
        up a college reputation as Comeback Joe, his size and weak arm were considered 
        knocks. As a result, a lot of Carson Palmers were drafted before the man 
        who ended up in the Pro Football Hall-of-Fame.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Regardless of how scouts and general managers evaluate upcoming classes 
        of players, a few gems will slide to the lower rounds. However, the reliance 
        on speed and strength tests inhibits a team's ability to draft the best 
        players available.</p>
