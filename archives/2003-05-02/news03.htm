        <font size="2">NATALIE CRAVEN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">In an effort to control any rowdy student behavior occurring 
        as a result of Ivies Weekend, Security officers were present at dinnertime 
        in Thorne Dining Hall on both Friday and Saturday evening. Dining Services 
        requested that Security &quot;staff the evening meals at Thorne on Friday 
        and Saturday nights because of past problems in the dining hall over Ivies 
        Weekend,&quot; Director of Security Bruce Boucher explained.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Security officers were present and filmed the dinner meal on the evening 
        of Saturday, April 26. &quot;Due to the numerous problems and outrageous 
        behavior that occurred on Friday night, it was decided to use a video 
        camera system in an effort to deter any similar behavior Saturday,&quot; 
        Boucher said. He added, &quot;It was my understanding that Saturday night 
        was more civil during the mealtime hours.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Because of our experience the past two years, we wanted to be proactive 
        in dealing with Ivies Weekend issues this year,&quot; Director of Dining 
        Services Mary Lou Kennedy said. &quot;[Our staff members] are not trained 
        to deal with drunk and disorderly conduct or students who don't respect 
        their authority-nor do [they] want to assume that role.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kennedy cited the large size of the dining room at Thorne as a factor 
        in the fact that student behavior got out of control. &quot;The dining 
        room at Thorne Hall seats over 500 people, and with the number of students 
        who were drunk when they arrived there and whose behavior was beyond unruly 
        and whose judgment was totally clouded by the effects of alcohol, it was 
        overwhelming for staff, supervisors, and the Security personnel on duty,&quot; 
        she explained. She added, &quot;We're truly disappointed that it became 
        so unruly at Thorne Hall that we felt the need to ask Security to assist 
        us and to identify specific individuals who totally abandoned any attempt 
        at civility.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While most students comprehend that mealtimes on Ivies Weekend can be 
        difficult to control, not everyone agreed with the actions taken. Adam 
        Ringel '04 said that while the presence of Security during dinner was 
        &quot;not necessarily a bad thing,&quot; he felt that &quot;it wasn't 
        great that they were videotaping.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Other students had no problem with security during meals. Alex Cornell 
        du Houx '06 said, &quot;I don't see any harm in them coming to the dining 
        hall; if it makes Dining Services feel better then it's fine.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Caroline Budney '03 said &quot;I can see how they are justified in doing 
        that, since I understand that Friday dinner was pretty unruly and they 
        would want to be able to know who was causing any damage that occurs.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The apparent success of this effort to lessen the disruption of students 
        at dinner during Ivies Weekend has led Boucher to keep the option in mind 
        for coming years. &quot;Based on the circumstances and lessons learned 
        from this year, we will plan accordingly if requested to assist dining 
        next year during Ivies weekend,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley said that the presence of Security 
        during Ivies Weekend meals &quot;made some sense. I understand the idea 
        behind it, because it was necessary to find some way to control the students.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bradley also expressed regret that the effort to control students during 
        Ivies Weekend has reached this level: &quot;It's unfortunate that five 
        percent of the students ruin the dining experience for the others present 
        and create problems for the dining staff who work so hard to give students 
        a good experience,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Moulton Union did not experience the same problems with intoxicated students. 
        Kennedy called the students who chose to eat there &quot;more respectful. 
        It was obvious that many had been drinking but they did not let their 
        fun get out of control.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We expect that adjustments will be made to make things better for 
        everyone next year,&quot; Kennedy said. &quot;Hopefully this was a learning 
        experience for all of us.&quot;</p>
