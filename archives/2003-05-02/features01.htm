      <p align="left">As the end of this academic year approaches and Commencement 
        is in sight for the Seniors, the Senior Class is coming to another set 
        crossroads in their lives. Commencement implies that one will be entering 
        upon something new. Many seniors hope to be embarking on a new stage in 
        their lives, but-for most seniors-what they will be embarking on is not 
        yet clear. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the overall economy may be gaining steam these days, especially 
        with the combat in Iraq over now, the job market is simply awful. The 
        Class of 2003 is entering the worst job market in over a decade, if not 
        longer. Many seniors have been able to secure jobs, but the truth of matter 
        is that many more seniors, who are seeking employment, are still in the 
        dark about their futures. So will the economy improve enough to shed some 
        light on the future of the senior class?</p>
      <p align="left">
        The economy does seem to have a more bullish sentiment these days, but 
        everyone looks toward the economy with guarded optimism. Federal Reserve 
        Chairman, Alan Greenspan, in his testimony to Congress on Wednesday said 
        that he believed that the economy would pick up at the end of this year, 
        but also noted that business pessimism could prevent that belief from 
        becoming reality. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Mr. Greenspan also for the first time raised concerns of deflation (when 
        prices fall) in his testimony to Congress. This mix of fear of further 
        economic weakness and belief that the economy will soon recover indicates 
        that the economy has come to another fork in the road. Either the economy 
        will recover as everybody has been hoping for the couple of years, or 
        the economy will lose what steam it may have gained from the post-war 
        boom and drop back into hard times.</p>
      <p align="left">
        What does this economic uncertainty mean for graduating seniors still 
        in the hunt for a job? This uncertainty in the economy will continue to 
        cast a dark shadow on the job market. The job market, in my opinion, will 
        not begin to pick up until the future of the economy comes a little more 
        into focus. Businesses, unfortunately, will be very cautious in their 
        hiring practices, therefore limiting the number of new positions, until 
        their own futures are little more secure, which is dictated by the security 
        of the economy and its future.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This has even had a profound effect on graduate schools as well. Younger 
        members of the job market who have been laid off along with graduating 
        students who might have entered or re-entered the job market in a good 
        economy have chosen to go to graduate school in hopes of avoiding the 
        bleak job market. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This has created a demand for graduate schools like never before. I have 
        heard of some graduate schools receiving three times the number of applications 
        than they did last year. This makes getting in graduate school as difficult 
        as getting a job right now, if not more difficult.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Graduating from a liberal arts college is supposed to provide you with 
        some choice in life. The point of a liberal arts education is to give 
        you a diverse background so that you can have a wide array of choices 
        after college, so that you are not limited to one field. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the benefits of a liberal arts background, the state of the economy 
        has left the Class with almost no choice. We are facing more of a fork 
        in the road instead of a set of crossroads. </p>
      <p align="left">
        All I can say is that I hope that we can look toward the future in the 
        same way Robert Frost did in his poem The Road Not Taken in which he says,</p>
      <p align="left">
        I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
      <p align="left">
        Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I</p>
      <p align="left">
        I took the one less traveled by,</p>
      <p align="left">
        And that has made all the difference.</p>
