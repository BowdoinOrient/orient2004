        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">On Saturday, June 4, 1994 Bowdoin College alumni, students, 
        faculty, staff, guests, and family members gathered in front of Gibson 
        Hall to dedicate &quot;The Bowdoin Memorial,&quot; which commemorated 
        the College's sons, who had given their lives in the defense of their 
        country during three global conflicts-the Second World War, the Korean 
        War, and Vietnam. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As part of the usually joyous reunion weekend, this solemn ceremony brought 
        together many Bowdoin veterans and civilians who had lived through the 
        troubling times of the mid-twentieth century. Made of pure Maine granite, 
        and flanked by two low granite walls and a low granite bench, the Memorial 
        was etched with one hundred and eleven names representing men from forty-four 
        different Bowdoin classes. It was the final tribute to many generations 
        of men who had given all they had so that their country-and with it, their 
        college, family, and friends-might live on. </p>
      <p align="left">
        At the close of World War II there were many gatherings like this one-men 
        who had traveled the world came together, shook hands, reminisced about 
        old times, and remembered their classmates who had not returned. One of 
        these who did not return was Andrew A. Haldane, who had been killed in 
        action on Peleliu Island in 1944. In his memory, men who had known him 
        and who respected him as a leader, a friend, and a very decent human being 
        came together and donated the Haldane Cup, which is awarded annually to 
        the graduating senior who has shown the most outstanding leadership character. 
        It was a fitting tribute.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were countless heroes in the Second World War, and the Bowdoin community 
        was happy to know many of them. From the frontlines there came dozens 
        of Purple Hearts, Distinguished Unit Citations, Gold, Silver and Bronze 
        Stars, Air Medals, Croix de Guerre, Distinguished Flying Crosses, and 
        even one Congressional Medal of Honor. Yet, these ribbons and pieces of 
        metal speak to only a mere fraction of the courage and the dedication 
        that Bowdoin men endured along with those of their generation. From the 
        field of battle to laboratories where cures for deadly diseases were found 
        to the small offices where intelligence gatherers hunted and sifted through 
        mounds of information that could save lives or turn the tide of a battle, 
        there were men who, with their lives and souls, kept faith in their cause 
        even when the hour was darkest. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kenneth C. M. Sills, who had lived and led his beloved college through 
        yet another world war, was glad when the Japanese finally surrendered 
        in August 1945. During the war, the mother of a Bowdoin man killed in 
        action wrote, &quot;I think I write all this to you because you, without 
        a son, have yet so many sons of Bowdoin, and many of these fine boys whom 
        you have helped and cared for are now dying in battle.&quot; It was true 
        that the Second World War had been very hard. Sills personally mourned 
        the death of his students and friends, and when the guns finally fell 
        silent, he was glad, not only because the killing would stop, but also 
        because many would be returning to the college to finish their education 
        and many new faces would also appear to take the places of those who were 
        no more-in short, the business of educating American's youth could continue 
        unabated now that the war had been ended.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dozens of Bowdoin men, who had had their college careers interrupted, 
        returned to finish their studies. Armed with the new GI Bill, hundreds 
        of other veterans also joined up to take classes. Amidst the Bowdoin Pines 
        there was once again laughter and cheer and partying. The men who had 
        faced down the great evils of the world could now return to their civilian 
        lives, relax, and complete their education. Again the house parties roared 
        with singing and dancing and again the small college in Maine, which had 
        weathered many crises, got back on track as the Chapel bells tolled the 
        beginning of classes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the men, young and old, veteran and freshman, filed into the Chapel, 
        as generations had done before them, Kenneth Sills imparted messages for 
        the future of the world. Of course he welcomed the men back to campus, 
        but he also warned them that the new atomic age was not one that guaranteed 
        peace. Fear of annihilation alone cannot prevent wars, he said; rather, 
        it was true human understanding that was man's only hope for a continued 
        peace. A few years later the Korean War broke out and again Sills led 
        the college through its bloody months, watching again as students were 
        sent across the Pacific to shed blood and die for their country. As an 
        educator and the symbol of Bowdoin to generations of graduates, Sills 
        had also seen much of the death and destruction in the world. It must 
        have been strange for him to be a man who could craft marvelous prose 
        and teach students to love each other, only to wave his students off to 
        war after war. Seven years after the close of the Second World War, Sills 
        would walk away from Bowdoin, retiring after three decades as its president. 
        For those who knew him, an era had ended.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Before Sills left, however, he spoke to the graduates of the Class of 
        1946 and to the returning veterans in the first commencement since the 
        start of World War II. On a beautiful Maine day, amidst a large crowd 
        of onlookers and old friends, with the U.S. flag flying proudly in the 
        blue sky, Kenneth Sills rose, smiled at the family, which was gathered 
        before him, and read the address he had entitled &quot;Prisoners of Hope.&quot; 
        In this ten-page speech Sills spoke of the continuing challenges. Yes, 
        peace had been won, he said but the greater challenge was now learning 
        to keep it. He entrusted this task to the graduates. &quot;Every one of 
        you,&quot; he said, &quot;must from now on study with all your energy 
        and might before this country and the world.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In whatever field and in the many different ways of studying the world's 
        problems, Sills emphasized understanding between people. Only when there 
        was understanding, he said, could there be &quot;unity and good-will.&quot; 
        In conclusion, the President wished them well, saying that he had faith 
        &quot;that you will give a good account of yourselves in peace as in war&#133;&quot; 
        Bowdoin College, he reminded them, would follow each one of them, &quot;with 
        interest and affection unto your life's end.&quot;</p>

      <p>This concludes my World War II Series. I have been unable to cover many 
        aspects of the war and have been unable to tell many stories of courage 
        and bravery by the thousands of Bowdoin men who served with great distinction 
        and great commitment during that trying conflict. It is to them and to 
        their generation that this series of articles is dedicated.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This also concludes my undergraduate writing for the Bowdoin Orient. I 
        am moving on to the graduate world at the University of Virginia, but 
        I leave you with a successor. I am passing the torch onto Kathryn Ostrofsky 
        '06, a promising and enthusiastic student of history. I trust you will 
        enjoy her stories and her writing.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It has been a long four years, and it has been an incredible journey for 
        me. I hope that you have enjoyed my exploration of Bowdoin's Civil War 
        figures, as well as this attempt to broaden my horizons and tell the story 
        of men from the 1930s and 1940s. I thank you for all the very kind letters 
        I have received in the past years and hope that Bowdoin's history-as well 
        as the history of this great country-will continue to fascinate you in 
        the years to come. If I've learned one thing in writing these articles, 
        it is that there is no end to the courageous deeds that Bowdoin men have 
        done in their lives. Many other stories remain to be told. I urge you 
        to find them and to tell others about them. Our past and our history are 
        things that we cannot afford to loose or forget. Many are the tales of 
        greatness and goodness. They inspire and guide us in our own troubled 
        times. The study of their virtue and their strength can only make us better. 
        That, I believe, should be our ultimate goal.</p>
