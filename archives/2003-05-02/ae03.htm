      <p align="left">Growing disillusioned with the blockbuster movies at Hoyts? 
        Fear not, Bowdoin has a film all its own. A year long, advanced independent 
        study in the History department has produced a 30-minute film, written, 
        produced, and directed by Bowdoin senior Ethan Bullard. The original score 
        was written and compiled by another Bowdoin talent, Colin Thibadeau, also 
        for independent study credit. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After The Gold Rush will premiere tonight at 8:00 p.m. in Smith Auditorium. 
        The multi-themed project is a study of a young man who attempts to escape 
        the industrial world only to find that it catches up with him.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After The Gold Rush is a creation that that combines Ethan's interest 
        in 19th-century American History, black and white Western films, and the 
        resources of the frontier. He spent the fall semester watching old Westerns 
        and reading both primary documents and the writings of Patricia Limerick 
        and Richard Slotkin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The picture was filmed in two sessions. The East Coast portion was filmed 
        at Lowell National Historic Park, where there is an old 19th century cotton 
        mill on the premises. Winter break brought the Bowdoin crew to Wyoming, 
        where the remainder of the film was shot on Bowdoin Rich Fox's '03 Bitterroot 
        Ranch. This past semester has been filled with editing-an estimated five 
        and a half hours of footage needed to be cut down to the 30-minute film. 
        The film is set in 1869 and shot in agreement with Ethan's film preference, 
        a 1920s aesthetic, resulting in a black and white silent film.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Scott Raker '05 stars as the young Scottish immigrant Angus MacKay, who 
        works in a Massachusetts mill. Jesse Cargill '03 fills in the other major 
        role as Griffith. Other Bowdoin players in the film are George Hubbard 
        '03, Dave Donnelly '03, Todd Forsgren '03, Rich Fox, Andy Keshner '03, 
        Mark Lutte '03, Julian Waldo '03, Jared B. Ware '05, James Wilikins '04, 
        and Jordan Harrison '04. Those of us knowledgeable in the history of film 
        or the American West will find the characters are inspired by prominent 
        figures in these respected disciplines (i.e. Griffith = D.W. Griffith).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Why a Western, Ethan? &quot;Westerns have always been fantasy pictures 
        where contemporary ideology is projected in a pseudo-historical setting 
        and a mythical frontier.&quot; The film, besides being a conglomeration 
        of Ethan's academic interests, also encompasses varying themes that have 
        plagued the U.S. since the days when the Western frontier was still an 
        untamed land. While there are plenty of films commenting on the displaced 
        people of the West, so Ethan brings to the forefront the importance of 
        the West's resources, because they had an enormous part in Western settlement 
        as well. While After the Gold Rush is in accordance with Westerns of the 
        time, Ethan's film is a more critical analysis of what has been done to 
        the West.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin students wrote, directed, acted, and produced every ounce of this 
        work, and that is certainly something this campus doesn't get to see everyday. 
        So whether you're a film buff, history kid, or cowboy, come and show your 
        support and enjoy a truly engaging independent film right in your own 
        back yard. Smith Auditorium, today at 8:00 p.m.. After the Gold Rush.
