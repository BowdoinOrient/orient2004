      <p align="left">Bowdoin Baseball's season has been characterized by daunting 
        losses and mind-blowing wins. These ups and downs reflect the stratified 
        NESCAC division. At the top is Trinity and Tufts, but from here there 
        is a drastic change in terms of quality opponents. Not surprisingly, this 
        is where Bates and Colby reside. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin rests in that perfect position between the two. As it has proven 
        against Tufts and Trinity, the junior-led team has the ability to pull 
        off big wins. With that, however, comes a responsibility to put the wins 
        on the board against teams that play below. Bowdoin, thus far, has taken 
        three out of four from in-state rivals Bates and Colby. Last weekend, 
        the squad took two from Bates.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Last Friday, the Bears made the trek up to Lewiston, or the &quot;City 
        on the Rise&quot; as some call it. The number one starter, first-year 
        Trevor &quot;Unchecked Aggression&quot; Powers, has been a staple on the 
        mound this year for the Bears. As the game went into extra innings against 
        Bates, he stayed in and threw ten innings of one-run ball while striking 
        out seven. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Offensively, the Bears struggled throughout the game. John Clifford '04, 
        Manny Lora '04, and Kevin &quot;Not only am I nasty at baseball, but apparently 
        I'm smart too&quot; Bougie '04 all had two hits. The winning run, however, 
        came in the tenth inning when, with two runners on, Clifford air-mailed 
        one over the fence. The Bears hung on and pulled off a huge late inning 
        win, 4-1, over the Bobcats.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the first game on Saturday, Mark &quot;No, I don't play for the Rams&quot; 
        Bulger '06 got the start. He went over five innings and pitched solidly, 
        not giving up an earned run. Complimenting Bulger's pitching, the Bowdoin 
        hitters were hot. Jim Shea '05 went two-for-four and Bougie and Clifford 
        both went one-for-three with a pair of home runs between them. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After a game where the bats had been silent, the Bears came out and did 
        it with the sticks. This win paved the possibility for a three-game sweep 
        of the Bobcats.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second game of the double-header proved to be a tough one for the 
        Bears. Ricky Leclerc '06 took the mound for the Bears and pitched a strong 
        game. In six plus innings of work, he gave up only three runs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Even with good work on the mound-you need to score runs to win ballgames. 
        After its offensive explosion in the first game, the Bears only had five 
        hits in the second game. They put up three runs, but they could not contain 
        the offense of the Bobcats. In the seventh inning, a two-run double sealed 
        the lead for Bates.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Last Wednesday, the Bears played a non-league game against Husson College. 
        Andy Workman '04 got the start for the Bears and pitched seven solid innings. 
        He let up the only four runs of the game for Husson, three of which were 
        earned. Travis Dube '04, who has evolved into a staple closer for the 
        Bears, finished the game. The Bears also came up big at the plate and 
        put up seven to beat Husson 7-4. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Some notable offensive performances for the Bears include sophomore Tom 
        McMahon's home run and Shady Shea's '05 three-hit outing. Also, known 
        for being an incredible wingman for his stud of a roommate, Justin &quot;Little 
        Wingy Wingy&quot; King '04 went two-for-five with a home run. That's pretty 
        good for a guy who started the season with a Napoleonic complex and only 
        had a sack of strawberries to show for it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After taking two against Bates and beating Husson, the Bears go into this 
        weekend looking ahead. They play two at Colby on Saturday and then travel 
        to Middlebury for a double header.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Taking all four this weekend would be a great end to a season full of 
        ups and downs for the Polar Bears. Plus, you can't bring that kind of 
        negative energy into the Pete Schuh Tournament anyway.</p>
