      <p align="left">This week's meal out marked a triple celebration. The Foodie 
        honored not only her entrance into the &quot;twenty-something&quot; realm 
        but also her final review of the year until next spring. Most importantly, 
        however, the Foodie celebrated Thai culinary glory. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Thai House is the best Thai restaurant in Brunswick. No protestations, 
        please. The Foodie has been to all three: NYC loft-style Bangkok Garden, 
        Thai &quot;the one that really is a house&quot; Dish, and Thai House &quot;of 
        yummers.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        What a shame that the best one is the farthest away from campus, all the 
        way on Pleasant Street past quite a few dealerships. Despite it's distance, 
        however, Thai House is worth the trip. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The cozy roadside establishment has a sunroom in which patrons may dine; 
        this Foodie and her Foodie friend sat right at the threshold of the glass 
        ceiling so that moonlight could gleam onto the plates. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A prodigious number of offerings are listed on the menu. After much deliberation, 
        the Foodie opted for summer rolls and basil chicken, while her friend 
        requested the ginger pork. Both decided to share an order of larb since 
        green papaya salad was unavailable. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The last time the Foodie ventured to the House, she ordered the famed 
        papaya salad for an appetizer. It blew her away! Though the Foodie covets 
        spicy food, and often has to convince the waiter at Shere Punjab to &quot;hit 
        her with his best shot,&quot; papaya salad at the House is the spiciest 
        dish she has ever tasted. It made her weep and clamor for napkins. Her 
        tongue felt like it was disintegrating; she seemed to breathe fire between 
        wheezing coughs. Needless to say, the Foodie recommends the papaya salad. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Huge summer rolls, or fresh vegetables, rice noodles and shrimp wrapped 
        in rice paper, arrived at the table soon after they were ordered. Although 
        she is usually reluctant to declare anything &quot;the best ever,&quot; 
        the Foodie will once again utter a superlative: these summer rolls were 
        the best she has ever had. After a couple of poor reviews, the Foodie 
        feels the need to praise something on a Brunswick plate. The House is 
        her saving grace: the rolls were neatly wrapped and easy to consume. She 
        was most pleased that they were filled mostly with fresh vegetables, whereas 
        other establishments often pinch pennies by filling the rolls with rice 
        noodles. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The entrees appealed to all senses. Basil wafted from the steaming plate 
        of chicken, peppers and onions, while the aroma of ginger cleared the 
        Foodie friend's nasal passages. The variety of color and the symmetrical 
        presentation of the entrees was as satisfying as the sound of steam rising 
        from the plate that she heard when her ear was lowered to it. The vegetables 
        were fresh and crunchy, the chicken tender and infused with basil, garlic, 
        and fish sauce. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The only disappointment of the evening was the larb. This dish, unfortunately, 
        did not delight the senses. While the dish did taste alright, with hints 
        of lemongrass and lime, it smelled like halitosis, or bad breath. Perhaps 
        the Foodie needs to work up her tolerance for such a delicacy, but she 
        finds it difficult to ignore smell, since she receives much of her dining 
        pleasure from aromas. The Foodie and her Friend kindly set the uneaten, 
        gauche plate aside. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the Foodie's failure to enjoy the larb, she still cannot wait 
        to take up residence in the House once again. </p>
