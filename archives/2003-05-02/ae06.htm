      <p align="left"> There is a dark side to Brunswick. Spearheaded by the Bowdoin 
        Cable Network and featuring over 35 students, Lonely at the Top hits Daggett 
        Lounge and Smith Auditorium this weekend. The feature film premiered Thursday, 
        May 1, to a packed and raucous crowd in Sills Hall.</p>
      <p align="left">
        For the past three months, the crew bared zero degree weather and strange 
        stares from peers, utilizing campus space from Dayton Arena to the security 
        office. Written primarily by Monica Guzman '05 and Matt Volk '03, the 
        dark comedy follows a string of seemingly unrelated brutal stabbings.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dexter (Ben McGuinness), a deranged Brunswick resident who has been rejected 
        by college admissions 18 years in a row is the reserved but deadly protagonist 
        in this highly anticipated feature. While security guards and the Bowdoin 
        administration struggle to keep the situation under wraps, Dexter eludes 
        notice, slaying tour guides one by one. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The lethal plot is uncovered by the overachieving, straight-laced Whitney 
        Sharp (Sara Bodner) who attempts to convince her friends (LaTricia Sealy 
        and Sam Cohan) of the truth. In the vain of a traditional slasher film, 
        she is constantly greeted by disbelief while the campus headcount steadily 
        drops. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Directed by Steven Gogolack and edited by Philip Sharp, the film lacks 
        all the mistakes that one would expect from a student production. The 
        murderous comedy flows seamlessly from scene to scene, taking advantage 
        of dismal Maine weather and the school's architecture. In one scene, Sharp 
        flees the killer in Smith Union's slowly ascending maze. Without high-tech 
        special effects, Lonely at the Top satirizing its own murder scenes in 
        a well done blend of comedy and suspense. Especially impressive is a show-down 
        in the stacks Truffaut than language media center.</p>
      <p align="left">

      <p align="left">
        &quot;Lonely at the Top&quot; is about a Bowdoin student, Whitney Sharp 
        who becomes aware of several murders occurring on campus, and takes it 
        upon herself to figure out who's behind the crimes. The murderer, Dexter 
        is one that was rejected by Bowdoin College and seeks revenge upon a corrupt 
        system by killing students in order to lower the school's national ranking, 
        while the President and Deans try to cover it up in order to preserve 
        the school's image. With the help of her friends and clues along the way, 
        Whitney pieces together the mystery. The film is not exactly a horror 
        film, but more of a parody or dark comedy and is sure to make you laugh 
        without any excessive gore or focus on violence. It is a fun movie and 
        was produced not as part of a film studies project or independent study 
        for credit, but purely for fun.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The film, &quot;Lonely at the Top&quot; is primarily the brainchild and 
        masterpiece of Matthew Volk, a senior and head of BCN. Last spring during 
        finals week, Matt wrote the story in twenty-four hours, with a little 
        help of his two roommates, Andy Cashman and Steven O'Malley. In December, 
        an outline of the story was given to Monica Guzman, who wrote the screenplay. 
        The movie began shooting in January, and with the exception of a few final 
        touches, was shot in a short six weeks with a cast and crew working six 
        days a week. The movie was directed by sophomore Steve Gogolak, and co-produced 
        by Gina von Shack. The film was edited in five weeks by Philip Sharp, 
        and is being put out by Pine Films, who also brought you the miniseries, 
        The Tower, and the twenty-four hour reality show, The Bubble. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Matthew Volk, after previewing the film and glimpsing at the trailer online, 
        says, &quot;This film exceeded my expectations. I am very proud of the 
        way it turned out and I sincerely hope that it is enjoyed by Bowdoin students&quot;. 
        In reflection, some of the favorite scenes to shoot were the ones that 
        required a group of fifty extras in the Daytona Hockey Arena, and the 
        scene that was shot in front of the Chapel (before it was devoured by 
        construction), when it was -2 degrees outside, in which the camera froze 
        and the cast and crew stood outside for a full three and a half hours. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The film is quite a remarkable achievement and should prove worth it to 
        all those curious enough to find out how talented these ambitious filmmakers 
        are. The premiere is on Thursday, May 1st in Smith Auditorium (tickets 
        required) and the two open screenings for the public are: Friday, 8pm 
        in Daggett Lounge, and Sunday, 7pm in Smith Auditorium (Sills Hall). </p>
