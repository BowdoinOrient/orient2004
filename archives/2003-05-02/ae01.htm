      <p>Despite the inclement weather Saturday, Bowdoin still managed to experience 
        the best Bear Aids concert in recent memory. After strong performances 
        by Siren, Helicopter Helicopter, and Reid Genaur and the Assembly of Dust, 
        The Samples honored the campus with an uplifting concert that rivals past 
        years' performances by Ween and Jurassic 5. I had the pleasure of meeting 
        The Samples for an intimate interview before the six-piece band graced 
        the stage in Smith Union. When they weren't busy quoting lines from Spinal 
        Tap and Sean Kelly, The Samples were able to offer some insightful offerings 
        to their impressive career.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now, if you are like a majority of the student body, you had probably 
        never heard The Samples before their visit to Bowdoin this weekend. They 
        do not make music videos and they are never featured on commercial radio. 
        If you are like me, however, you've been a fan of their catchy melodies 
        and intricate jams for years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I first heard The Samples in the fall of 1996 when my brother returned 
        home from college for the first time with a copy of the band's fourth 
        album, The Last Drag. I was sold upon first listen. &quot;Little Silver 
        Ring,&quot; the first song on that album and one of my all-time favorites, 
        represents everything that is wonderful about The Samples' music: folky 
        lyrics buttressed by a slightly reggae rhythm, featuring the dry, yet 
        melodic, vocals of Sean Kelly and supported by the eclectic musicianship 
        of the backing band members.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Founded in Boulder, Colorado by guitarist Kelly and original bassist, 
        Andy Sheldon, (both Milton, Vermont natives), The Samples have experienced 
        the music industry's roller coaster ride. With humble beginnings in the 
        local Colorado scene, The Samples grew to national fame in the early 90s 
        among the headliners of the HORDE tour and playing sold out club shows 
        across the country with popular songs like &quot;Feel Us Shaking,&quot; 
        &quot;Did You Ever Look So Nice,&quot; &quot;Indiana,&quot; and &quot;Nature.&quot; 
        They performed on the Jay Leno show and even played for Bill Clinton during 
        his re-election campaign. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A little known fact: The Dave Matthews Band got a big leg up when they 
        opened for The Samples prior to their 1994 release, Under the Table and 
        Dreaming. The band struggled amidst shoddy record deals and lawsuits, 
        however, leading to many tours in undersold, small venues. I've seen them 
        perform in large outdoor festivals, and small smoky dives. When I asked 
        the band members what their favorite type of venue is, they unanimously 
        responded, &quot;Sold out ones.&quot; The Samples played at Bowdoin several 
        years ago, (before my time here) and were delighted to return. The latest 
        line up brought five new musicians to Bowdoin's stage: Len Mooney on keyboards, 
        bassist Jared Johnson, drummer Bill Mutchler, rhythm guitarist Tom Askin, 
        and the polar bear doppelganger Brian &quot;Snowman&quot; Powers on saxophone. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Samples have been contracted by upwards of seven record labels, including 
        one major label, MCA, in 1996. Recognized by their paper album sleeves, 
        The Samples have released fourteen albums in as many years. The band is 
        now completely independent, producing, distributing, and promoting their 
        albums all on their own. Sean Kelly offered, &quot;Sure we'd take another 
        major label contract, if it felt right. We know now what kind of contract 
        we need. You need to deal with people.&quot; They also said they are not 
        opposed to making music videos, its just that they've never had a label 
        willing to finance such a venture. Kelly acknowledged, though, that most 
        MTV videos are, &quot;just cheeseball mini movies.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Samples' musical styling invokes a wide range of influences, most 
        notable is Neil Young. &quot;Neil's real,&quot; Sean Kelly says. &quot;He's 
        a hero to look up to. We've tried everything in our power to perform with 
        him.&quot; I have yet to attend a Samples concert where the band has not 
        covered a Young song. They've performed a range of classic Neil from &quot;Cinnamon 
        Girl&quot; and &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; to &quot;Old Man&quot; 
        and &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot; Saturday's concert featured a special guest 
        performance by Sarah Ramey '03, who sang a duet of &quot;Down by the River&quot; 
        with Kelly during a brief acoustic set. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition to Neil Young, members of The Samples cited a long list of 
        influences, including Suzanne Vega, Jane Seaberry, Bruce Hornsby, The 
        Beatles, Cat Stevens, Elton John, Thelonious Monk, John Scofield, The 
        Police, and Peter Gabriel. The Samples attributed their reggae influence 
        from touring with The Wailers early in their early career. Listening to 
        a Samples record, one can hear all of these influences surfacing, but 
        occasionally the band is guided by outside elements from guest musicians. 
        The most notable of these are violinist Boyd Tinsley from the Dave Matthews 
        Band and saxophonist Branford Marsalis. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Throughout their unconventional history spanning more than a decade and 
        a half, The Samples have built a steadily growing underground fan base 
        that has supported the band's continuous touring regardless of record 
        sales and promotional deals. The Samples have suffered so many departures 
        and near-total breakups that Kelly is the only remaining member from the 
        original lineup. Despite these setbacks, Kelly explains, they are driven 
        and motivated by the &quot;passion for the music.&quot; He continued, 
        &quot;passion will kill us before the side effects. People have come in 
        and out of the band but its still exciting for us because we live for 
        the unknown.&quot; The Samples are a rare find amidst the cooperate rock 
        which clogs our musical markets today. With an attitude of truly playing 
        for the love of the music, they are a welcome alternative to the MTV world. 
        When asked when they would know it's time to finally retire, Kelly responded, 
        &quot;When it becomes routine.&quot;</p>

        If you enjoyed The Samples' Bear Aids performance, do your part to keep 
        their passion alive: visit their website at www.thesamples.com and be 
        sure to attend future concerts. Before heading west, The Samples are playing 
        at Colby this Saturday at 10:00 p.m. </p>
