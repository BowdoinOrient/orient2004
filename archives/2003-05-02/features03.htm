      <p align="left">I have to admit that I am spoiled. However, before I came 
        to the U.S. I did not know that. Back in Germany, even in my hometown 
        of Neuwied, which is not much bigger than Brunswick, we actually have 
        means of public transportation. Hourly buses connect Neuwied with every 
        little surrounding village, and trains come and go from the bigger cities 
        almost every fifteen minutes. I took all of that for granted and even 
        complained that there were no buses running between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 
        a.m.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Last September, however, when I arrived in Brunswick, I soon realized 
        what little reason I actually had to complain about public transportation 
        in Germany. In the first couple of weeks in Maine with neither car nor 
        bike, I felt completely cut off from the rest of civilization. If I needed 
        to go shopping, to Wal-Mart that is, it took me about three and a half 
        hours roundtrip. While some of my friends with cars made it to Boston 
        and back in that time.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This walk was not really a pleasure, and I still remember well the faces 
        of all the people that flew by in their big cars, covering the distance 
        between Brunswick and Cook's Corner in about five minutes. I still remember 
        children pressing their little hands and their tiny noses against the 
        windows, peering out, staring at me, their lips forming the question: 
        &quot;Mummy, what is this strange man doing out there?&quot; I remember 
        the mothers laughing hard, their unheard replies: &quot;This, my boy, 
        we call walking. We do not do that anymore, unless we really have to. 
        I guess this strange man is not from our country.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Fortunately, it was a nice day back then in September with neither rain 
        nor chill. So, I did not really mind the hike. Except that there is actually 
        no sidewalk on the Bath Road between Brunswick and Cook's Corner, not 
        to mention traffic lights for pedestrians. So, after a somewhat dangerous 
        and tedious march of </p>
      <p align="left">
        about 45 minutes, I ended up at the intersection of Route 24 and Bath 
        Road.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Waiting there for another fifteen minutes watching the constant traffic 
        of what I suppose was Brunswick's rush hour, I finally lost my patience. 
        In a fit of suicidal frustration, I jumped on the street and tried to 
        just run across the six lanes of Route 24. This maneuver won me a mixture 
        of pitiful smiles and mad honkings from the drivers and almost caused 
        serious injury to myself. But after all, I safely made it to Wal-Mart 
        and immediately purchased the first item on my shopping list-a bike. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This made things a lot easier for me and by and by I found out that even 
        in Brunswick there are means of public transportation. They are simply 
        not the ones I was used to from Germany. Instead of buses and trains, 
        I came to find out that foreigners in Maine should rely on friends (because 
        almost everybody has a car) or try hitchhiking (because people in Maine 
        kindly share their cars). Besides this, I learned about some special contracts 
        Bowdoin arranged for its students, e.g. with the taxi service.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now I know that the public transportation here is almost more convenient 
        than German buses and trains, because you are not dependent on schedules. 
        Too bad that I have to go back in a couple of weeks-I hope I do not miss 
        my plane.<br>
