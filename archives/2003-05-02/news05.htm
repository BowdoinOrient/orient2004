      </table>
      <p align="left">One would not know that rugby is a club sport from watching 
        the women's team practicing on the pitch behind Farley Field House. The 
        lady ruggers have seen tremendous success in intercollegiate competition 
        over the past few years, and the dedication and cohesion of the team played 
        a big part in the recent decision to make women's rugby a varsity sport 
        at Bowdoin College.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The women's rugby program here is very impressive,&quot; said Athletic 
        Director Jeffrey Ward. &quot;It's great to see a place like Bowdoin College 
        with such a different kind of women's contact sport.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the strength of the women's rugby program was central to Ward's 
        decision in changing the team's status, there were many other factors 
        at play. &quot;The recent budget cuts not only reduced the size of the 
        Athletic Department, but it also required a lot of restructuring of our 
        budget,&quot; Ward said. &quot;It presented me with an opportunity to 
        make something like this happen.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward also cited Title IX compliance as a motivating factor in his decision. 
        &quot;The new status of the women's rugby team makes Bowdoin one of the 
        only true Title IX compliant schools in the country,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward noted that the biggest change for the women's team will be financial. 
        Instead of receiving funding through the SAFC, the team will now get its 
        money through the Athletic Department. Mary Beth Mathews, the women's 
        rugby coach, will be employed by the school like any other varsity coach, 
        and the team will have transportation and uniform services on par with 
        other varsity teams. Most of the other operations of the team will remain 
        in place.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the new status of the team will mean more funding and more access 
        services, Ward was surprised when his decision was met with mostly silent 
        resentment from the team itself. Far from being excited about the decision, 
        many members of the team were upset that varsity status could eliminate 
        the fun and social atmosphere that makes rugby special.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;As a senior who has been playing rugby for four years, I know that 
        what we have on the rugby team is a camaraderie and respect, both on and 
        off the pitch, that I have not found in any other sport I have played,&quot; 
        said Courtney Tolmie. &quot;If we work hard, it's possible that we could 
        ensure that 'varsity' is just a label for the team, rather than a change 
        in the atmosphere of the team itself. However, I think that being a varsity 
        sport comes with certain limitations that have the potential to change 
        the culture of the team.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Tolmie is not alone in her reservations. &quot;I have my reservations,&quot; 
        said rugger Alexis Goldstein '03. &quot;Rugby is a sport that is wonderful 
        for its inclusiveness and its novelty in college-very few people have 
        played before, and it has a strong sense of tradition. I feel that being 
        varsity puts these qualities at great risk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        More importantly, Goldstein added, was the fact that the team was not 
        consulted about the decision. &quot;We were given the news, we were not 
        asked,&quot; she said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward understands these criticisms well. &quot;I should have had more conversations 
        with current players,&quot; he admitted. &quot;But this [decision] did 
        not come out of the blue. I have been in conversations with Dean Bradley 
        and the rugby coaches for a while, and this was the right time to make 
        the decision.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Responding to sentiments that the program will change with its new status, 
        Ward assured his critics that he has the best interests of the team in 
        mind. &quot;A lot of the responsibility in a club sport comes from the 
        team,&quot; he said, &quot;and I don't want that to change. I want to 
        give the team as many opportunities as I can without changing the sense 
        of community.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Another problem raised by Ward's decision is the fact that the men's rugby 
        team, still a club sport, will still have to share the rugby pitch and 
        rugby equipment with the women's team.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I have realistic expectations,&quot; said Ward, &quot;and nothing 
        is going to change overnight. The women's team currently enjoys a very 
        good relationship with the men's team, and I don't want to disrupt that.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the controversy surrounding his decision, Ward is optimistic about 
        the future of rugby at Bowdoin College. &quot;The difference between club 
        and varsity sports is blurring,&quot; he said. &quot;I know that some 
        people are not happy with the Athletic Department's decision, but we have 
        the same goals in mind. I did what I think will be best for the program.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        For the current seniors, this decision will have little effect on their 
        rugby careers, which will be ending soon. It remains to be seen how the 
        new change in funding and status will affect the younger classes in the 
        coming years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Regardless of how I might feel about the decision, it's going to 
        happen, so we need to deal with it,&quot; said first-year rugger Leslie 
        Wittenbraker. &quot;I think there are some definite benefits, but as for 
        now, we need to make sure that we don't let our new title change the team 
        and what it stands for.&quot;</p>
