      <p align="left">Eventual negative reactions are inevitable. Too many apples 
        and the flavor's gone. Too many free movie rentals and you get too lazy 
        to cash in. It all has to start fading sometime right? Well, maybe not. 
        As of day 622 after buying the Strokes' Is This It?, the album still sounds 
        just as dandy sweet as it was on the third listen (nothing's perfect the 
        first time through) on October 17, 2001. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The album's tense riffs, intelligently adolescent lyrics, superb bass 
        lines, and barreling vocals unite into, bar none, the best album I've 
        ever been fortunate enough to hear (of course, this opinion is from the 
        perspective of an angsty, apathetic, and disenchanted college kid).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Little did I know then that this quintessential expression of early life's 
        disillusionment would spawn, or at least exemplify, an explosive rock 
        revival. Unfortunately, the movement would suffer the same fate as the 
        apples: the whole movement has gotten really old, really rotten, really 
        fast. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It started off so auspiciously. Soon after the Strokes came Black Rebel 
        Motorcycle Club with their psychedelic-noir, reverb heavy masterpiece, 
        BRMC. Then, in 2002's early winter, the White Stripes blossomed out of 
        their candy-coated lairs in Detroit to bring us the raucous, velvet-touched, 
        and perhaps a tad too long fire and asphalt assault of White Blood Cells. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Rounding out the early trifecta is the Moldy Peaches' self-titled debut. 
        Their juvenile brilliance, spliced with porn references and a super-poorly 
        recorded guitar, made The Moldy Peaches an asinine, fun, and dirty anti-folk 
        album. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even the second batch was fantastic: the Vines (Highly Evolved), the Hives 
        (Veni Vidi Vicious), and the Warlocks (Rise and Fall) released stellar, 
        diverse albums. Sadly, these summer releases were the inevitable zenith, 
        the beginning of the decline, the backlash, et cetera for the supposed 
        rock revival. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The success of these albums obviously alerted someone upstairs in a BIG 
        label to flood the market with derivative &quot;garage rock&quot; bands, 
        start up the hype machine for every little &quot;indie band&quot; in the 
        northern hemisphere, and hijack yet another underground movement, killing 
        any creativity and inventiveness in the process.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bands that profited (or suffered, depending on your outlook) included 
        the mind-numbingly boring Mooney Suzuki. Rather than creating a unique 
        sound or fusing their influences into some unstoppable rock and roll juggernaut, 
        the band simply rehashes old R&amp;B songs that are devoid of any melody 
        whatsoever. They flail around onstage, hoping someone out there is so 
        enamored of their derivative stage act that he or she will buy the album. 
        Even their recent opening act at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City, 
        The Raveonettes, absolutely kicked their ass musically just by coldly 
        gazing into the audience and playing distorted, abrasive rock gems.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Another group to lose its once sweet flavor is the White Stripes, whose 
        Elephant is slow, tedious, and pretentious-sometimes all in the same song.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The forthcoming Strokes album will be the ultimate criterion to decide 
        if this decline is a mere rotten spot on an otherwise ripe road to rock 
        and roll supremacy or an insurmountable fall. Until then, the movement 
        can only be defined and judged by its newest release, the most recently 
        hyped-beyond-recognition entry into rock and roll. That album, my friends, 
        is the Yeah Yeah Yeah's Fever to Tell.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sadly, it seems that the rock revival's fall from infallibility will continue 
        at a fevered pace. Don't get me wrong: Fever to Tell certainly isn't a 
        bad album, nor are the YYYs an unexciting band, as their Master EP demonstrates. 
        But on Fever, they fall quite short of realizing the expectations Master 
        sets. After a promising keyboard opening in the frantically pulsing, Faint-esque 
        &quot;Rich,&quot; the album takes a turn towards the simply dull. The 
        first five tracks blend together in a monotonous mix of off-key screeching, 
        start-stop rhythms, and (luckily) a plethora of catchy, angular riffs. 
        Not until &quot;No No No,&quot; the eighth song out of only eleven on 
        the disc, do the YYYs seem to find something they've apparently misplaced 
        in the earlier tracks: melody. This foundational element to every great 
        album is almost completely absent from the first 20 minutes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even the last three tracks cannot redeem Karen O's early forays into clich&eacute; 
        hip, holier-than-thou, art chic, off-kilter scream attacks that completely 
        muffle Nick Zinner's excellent mutated blues riffs. Fortunately, there 
        is a bright side: the last three tracks, &quot;Maps,&quot; &quot;Y Control,&quot; 
        and &quot;Modern Romance,&quot; are a promising omen for the Yeah Yeah 
        Yeahs' future. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Fusing Velvet Underground minimalism with simple melodic female vocals 
        (slightly reminiscent of Moe Tucker's occasional singing for the VU), 
        spastic keyboard parts, and short repetitive guitar riffs, these tracks 
        show the YYYs exploring new territory, a trait not often seen in these 
        revivalist bands. When Karen sings &quot;Wait/they don't love you like 
        I love you&quot; in &quot;Maps&quot; for the first time she actually sounds 
        sincere, in contrast to her uninteresting delivery in the opening songs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The YYYs' Fever to Tell certainly isn't the death null for rock's refashioning; 
        rather, it just signals to a continuing nose dive. I hope The Strokes 
        will set everything straight again this year. Then again, maybe not. Maybe 
        rock is doomed to fall again as another victim to overzealous profiteering 
        and mind-corrupting hype extremes. Someone save our rock and roll once 
        again please!</p>
