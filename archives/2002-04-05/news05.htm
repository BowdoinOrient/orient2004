        ORIENT STAFF</font> </font></p>
      <p align="left">The Faculty voted 45 to 29 to add pluses and minuses to 
        Bowdoin's grading system, a change that will go into effect for all students 
        in the 2002-2003 academic year. Of the 74 faculty members voting at their 
        meeting Monday, 61 percent voted for the change, while 39 voted against 
        it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Immediately following the vote, chair of the Recording Committee 
        Stephen Naculich moved to overturn the College's long-held policy that 
        prohibits students' GPAs from being printed on their transcripts and replace 
        it with a policy that requires GPA to appear on all transcripts. The reason 
        for the change, he said, is that GPA is not computed consistently among 
        all students, with each student computing his or her own GPA individually. 
        The Faculty will discuss the proposed measure at their May meeting.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mark Lucci '04, a member of the Recording Committee who 
        was present at the meeting, said he has heard from many students who are 
        upset by the change. &quot;It was my impression,&quot; he said, &quot;that 
        the Faculty did not look at the student opinion poll or the forum in very 
        high regard. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Granted, it is up to the Faculty to set academic policy, 
        including grading, but I feel the details of the system have a greater 
        impact on the student body than the Faculty,&quot; Lucci said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To get a sense of how much the entire student body is upset 
        by the change, Lucci will be holding a meeting on Monday night at 8 p.m. 
        at 7 Boody St. for anyone interested in discussing the adoption of the 
        plus/minus grading system. The goal of this meeting, he said, is primarily 
        organizational and to brainstorm ideas on what steps to take to persuade 
        the Faculty to make further changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Before the vote Monday, economics professor John Fitzgerald 
        moved to amend the plus/minus measure by adding A/B and B/C grades instead 
        of pluses and minuses. In response, Naculich remarked that a major reason 
        for the change is to improve communication among Bowdoin and other schools. 
        The proposed amendment was voted down, though a significant number of 
        faculty members voted in support of it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professors in favor of a plus/minus system argued that it 
        would allow for greater accuracy and distinction among student work. Others 
        disagreed, citing that there already exists a five-point range of grades 
        and that grade inflation might worsen. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Computer science professor Alan Tucker said that Cs are 
        underutilized grades, and that professors can distinguish among students 
        if they give more Cs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Government professor Jean Yarbrough strongly expressed worries 
        about increased grade inflation under a plus/minus system, and urged that 
        the Faculty not vote for pluses and minuses until there's a clearer sense 
        of how they would affect grade inflation. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While there might be at least a one-time shift upwards of 
        mean grades following the change, philosophy professor Sehon responded, 
        this would not necessarily indicate a continuous nudging up of students' 
        overall GPAs.<br>
        There was disagreement over how to handle student input in the matter.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mathematics professor Matt Killough urged other faculty 
        members to take student opinion seriously and vote against the measure 
        so as to avoid sending the message that professors overvalue the importance 
        of grades.<br>
        &quot;One of the things that distinguishes us from other institutions 
        is our lack of emphasis on grades,&quot; Killough said, citing also that 
        SATs are optional and that GPAs are not computed. &quot;We don't see grades 
        as what's fundamentally important&#133;.I think students are here largely 
        because they appreciate that that's what we value,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;My students do not want this grade change,&quot; chemistry 
        professor Richard Broene said, explaining part of his reasoning for voting 
        against the change.<br>
        Others were not so convinced that students themselves devalue the importance 
        of grades or that student poll results should be taken into account. There 
        was a sense among certain faculty members that the 37 percent turnout 
        in the student poll was too low to gauge student opinion on the matter.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While agreeing that education should not be about grades, 
        sociology professor Nancy Riley said that Bowdoin students &quot;care 
        desperately&quot; about their grades. &quot;I think that grades are very 
        important at Bowdoin, and students see their grades as very important,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bemoaning a two-hour argument with a student over a grade, 
        theater professor Davis Robinson also said he felt that Bowdoin students 
        are very grade conscious and that a plus/minus system could alleviate 
        such arguments.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Economics professor Deborah DeGraff wondered if students 
        were aware of the grading system prior to coming to Bowdoin. Melissa Tansey 
        '02, a member of the Recording Committee, responded that prospective students 
        do seek out this information, and it is available to them at least through 
        the College Catalogue, which is sent to all applicants. She said that 
        many students at the February forum expressed that they did know about 
        Bowdoin's grading prior to coming here and that it factored into their 
        decisions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">English professor Marylin Reizbaum said she believed that 
        many of the students at the forum had a &quot;retroactive&quot; memory, 
        and that they didn't actually know about the grading system before coming 
        to Bowdoin but only thought they did in looking back. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Robinson asked if professors would be required to use pluses 
        and minuses under the new system. In reply, Dean Craig McEwen said that 
        right now Bowdoin has a five-point grading system and not everyone gives 
        out all five grades.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Following the vote, philosophy professor Scott Sehon, who 
        voted in favor of the change, moved to reconsider. He said that since 
        this was such a contentious issue, he only supported the measure if a 
        large majority of the faculty voted in favor of it. Since there was not 
        a large majority of the votes in favor, he recommended that the faculty 
        vote again so that he and others could change their votes to oppose the 
        measure. The motion to reconsider was voted down.</p>
