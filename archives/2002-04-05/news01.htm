        <font size="2">DANIEL JEFFERSON MILLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font> </font></p>
      <p align="left">A heated exchange of words turned to blows in the early 
        hours of last Sunday. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on March 31, three Bowdoin 
        students-two males and one female-ran into four college-aged male non-Bowdoin 
        students. The four males expressed that they were from another college 
        and a conversation ensued. One of the Bowdoin males apparently offended 
        one of the four males, which caused one of the four to punch the Bowdoin 
        student in the face.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Security Officer Michael Demers was on foot patrol in the 
        nearby vicinity when he heard raised voices. He arrived at the scene to 
        find that the four non-students had already run off. The Bowdoin students, 
        however, were able to indicate the direction in which they had run, and 
        Demers got on the radio to notify his fellow Security Officers and the 
        Brunswick Police Department.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Three of the four non-students were apprehended, and were 
        returned to the scene of the crime, where the assault victim was able 
        to identify the assailant. The accused striker admitted his guilt to security 
        and police personnel, and the victim was presented with this information. 
        Thanks to the expedient work of Bowdoin Security, there was more than 
        enough information to charge the assailant with assault.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The victim, however, indicated that he did not wish to press 
        charges, and the detained threesome was released. The three non-students 
        were issued criminal trespass warnings, which prohibit them from entering 
        into the Bowdoin College campus. Of the three who were detained, two were 
        from the Brunswick area.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This attack comes at a time of heightened awareness of trespassers 
        upon the Bowdoin campus, given the March 3 stabbing death of Bates College 
        senior Morgan McDuffee in Lewiston, Maine. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a result of the Bates incident, Bowdoin Security Director 
        Bruce Boucher indicated that Security has been more vigilant regarding 
        questionable individuals on campus. Boucher said that most of the time, 
        if someone is on campus who is not supposed to be there, they he or she 
        usually genuinely lost. In the last few weeks, however, Bowdoin security 
        has been keeping a more watchful eye on campus visitors.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the case of an incident such as the aforementioned, Boucher 
        encouraged all students to cooperate with Bowdoin Security and the Brunswick 
        Police Department to maintain a steady flow of justice and safety. Violent 
        crimes such as these present a great threat to the well-being of the Bowdoin 
        community, and the best course of action is to effectively reprimand guilty 
        parties.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Should you find yourself in a confrontation with any individuals-Bowdoin 
        students or not-Boucher encouraged students to remove themselves from 
        the situation to avoid any chance of conflict. Harbors of safety include 
        the numerous blue light telephones that dot campus, or at least a well-lit 
        area. Should students feel uncomfortable traversing campus at night, Boucher 
        encouraged walking with friends.</p>
