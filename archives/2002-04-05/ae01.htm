      <p align="left"> The Bowdoin Cable Network's annual twenty-four hour reality 
        television show, &quot;The Bowdoin Bubble,&quot; appropriates the term 
        students lovingly use to refer to this rural college. Is it possible to 
        depict &quot;reality&quot; on a campus that is notorious for its lack 
        of connection with the real world?<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">According to BCN staffers, such a feat is possible. Co-General 
        Manager Matt Volk and Film Director Brendan Smith-Elion chose to create 
        another episode this year because of the popularity last year's show, 
        which the BCN broadcast October 13 and 14, 2000. Volk cites an example 
        of the show's popularity last year: &quot;I remember...[that at] a party 
        at Helmreich [House], half of the students were dancing and the other 
        half were watching the Bubble.&quot; Smith-Elion reports that there were 
        over 4,000 hits on the Bubble website last year, from students wanting 
        to contribute to the online forum or to watch the show live online. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last year's broadcast, an experiment according to Volk, 
        laid the foundations for this year's Bubble broadcast. The show is stressful 
        to produce because it requires technical skill. There are also a lot of 
        participants to manage; nineteen students competed and twelve students 
        worked behind the scenes. Despite the preparation and organization that 
        broadcasting the show requires, the staff enjoys producing it. Volk says, 
        &quot;It's a fun event and I hope the campus enjoys it. It's worth our 
        time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This year's Bubble placed nineteen students in the basement 
        of MacMillan House to compete for $250, which came from the BCN's budget. 
        Over eighty students applied to be on the Bubble, but only twenty could 
        participate (one student dropped out due to illness). Show producers selected 
        certain students in order to have a good mix of personalities.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Volk, the show's host, led three teams of five and one team 
        of four through various tests of physical prowess, endurance, wit and 
        and bravery. Such tests included trivia contests, a hidden talent exhibition, 
        a dance contest and a game of Monopoly. Says Volk, &quot;The events became 
        progressively more challenging [as the night wore on] because people were 
        fried.&quot; Teams either gained or lost points according to how they 
        fared in the events; at the end of each event, viewers could vote off 
        players via the internet. Students whom the audience voted off later convened 
        to vote off other participants. By 3:30 Saturday morning, there were eight 
        students left in the game.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At 3:30 Saturday afternoon, Eric Morin triumphed over finalists 
        Alan Barr and Shaina Zamaitis to win the grand prize. Reflecting on his 
        Bubble experience, Morin says he enjoyed bonding with the cast: &quot;It's 
        really cool to see all these people around now and say 'hi' and know that 
        we all...have something in common.&quot; Despite her loss, Zamaitis says 
        &quot;It was very fun. I would recommend doing it.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What will Morin do with his $250 dollars? &quot;I will probably 
        throw a massive Barbeque...and of course everyone [from the Bubble cast] 
        is invited, and I also wouldn't mind going out to China Rose once or twice...buying 
        a couple of new whiffle balls...[and] perhaps taking some girl out to 
        dinner.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Volk, this year's show ran smoothly and viewers 
        were very engaged in the show. &quot;It was a tremendous success,&quot; 
        Volk says, &quot;due in large part to Brendan [Smith-Elion] and BCN staff 
        members putting in hours.&quot; </p>
