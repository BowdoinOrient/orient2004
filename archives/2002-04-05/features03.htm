        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font> </font></p>
      <p align="left">The studio apartment I took over from Gilbert was on the 
        second floor of a two-story building on Elm Street, off California Avenue, 
        just below the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A long narrow corridor with the bathroom on the left as 
        one entered led to the living room facing the street and a small kitchen 
        at the side overlooking a parking lot. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next door to me (as in the famous sixties hit) lived a girl 
        called Alice. She seemed a hippie and a collective girlfriend to a group 
        of four hip musicians from St. Louis, no doubt hoping to make it big on 
        the West Coast, as well as with her. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But having gotten myself a job with the San Francisco Post 
        Office, at the sorting office near the airport, I at first didn't see 
        much of Alice. Working the early shift from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., I'd get 
        up 4:30 a.m., to catch the first bus at 5 to the airport. Since the cable 
        cars didn't run that early I walked down Powell to the bus depot just 
        off Market Street. The ride to the airport took about 45 minutes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sorting letters was easy work but also boring. So I volunteered 
        to help load sacks of mail onto vans backed up to platforms on the outside, 
        glad of the exercise and fresh air. Working with four groovy types whistling 
        hit tunes I used to fantasize about us five being a pop group, naturally 
        called The Postmen. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back downtown about 3 p.m. I'd head for one of the bars 
        on Market Street for a beer and a scotch egg, my lunch, while putting 
        what change there was left from a dollar bill into the juke box. It was 
        here that I for the first time heard Jim Morrison of the Doors singing 
        &quot;Light my Fire&quot; and Otis Redding's &quot;Sittin' on the Dock 
        of the Bay.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These two hits to me still are the musical distillation 
        of hippie life on the West Coast in the late sixties. People used to cluster 
        round parked cars with the windows down and someone inside listening to 
        Light my Fire on the car radio. I never heard Jim Morrison sing it in 
        person, but did hear and see Jimmy Hendrix, another doomed pop star destined 
        to be a cult figure, maltreat and obscenely lick his guitar, with Chuck 
        Berry on the same bill doing his famous duck walk. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back at my pad an our or so later I would shower, light 
        up a joint, listen to some more music, and later go to Chinatown, just 
        five minutes from Elm Street, on the other side of Sacramento. Here I 
        would have the main meal of the day at a cheap Chinese restaurant, with 
        the family sitting at a round table in the back, single customers like 
        myself at a counter. A big plate of beef and tomato on rice, my favorite 
        dish apart from sweet-and-sour pork, would set me back all of 95 cents. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One day when getting home I found a basket with fruit and 
        bread outside my door, the latter baked by herself, the accompanying note 
        from Alice said. I was flabbergasted, but also pleased, and above all 
        intrigued. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So when getting back from Chinatown I knocked on Alice's 
        door to thank her, she asked me in for coffee and a chat. None of her 
        four boyfriends were there. They played at a club in North Beach she explained, 
        sharing a place nearby. Only one of them was her boyfriend, and didn't 
        come very often, she smiled.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Encouraged by that smile and the baskets outside my door 
        I started going over to Alice's almost every evening. We'd drink coffee, 
        talk, share a joint, listen to music, dance together. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I know it sounds trite, but one thing led to another. Just 
        how, in view of my lack of experience, I can no longer say. But I think 
        getting high in my case was the equivalent of Dutch courage concerning 
        the opposite sex. One couldn't think of a better argument for legalizing 
        pot, could one. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And I loved it. Sleeping with a young girl, or rather woman 
        (Alice was 20, I believe) beat everything I'd ever experienced before. 
        But I'm afraid I didn't make her very happy, at least not at first. Being 
        high I lost all inhibitions and selfishly concentrated on my own pleasure. 
        Touch me, please touch me, she kept saying. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Still, I must have learned my lesson in the end. For suddenly, 
        incredibly enough, there were wedding bells in the air. She'd asked her 
        mother to fly out to San Francisco, Alice told me. Her Dad had a construction 
        business, she said, in Providence, Rhode Island. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When I told Nellie about Alice and me she too was <i>Feuer 
        und Flamme</i>, as we say, literally 'fire and flame', that is all for 
        the idea. Why didn't I bring Alice and her mother down to Carmel for the 
        weekend, they could sleep in the guest room, I downstairs in the apartment 
        next the garage. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was an extraordinary weekend. While old Nellie sat talking 
        to my prospective mother-in-law on the patio overlooking Carmel Bay, with 
        Kumi the Japanese help (married to a black Army cook at Fort Ord) getting 
        lunch ready for all of us, Alice and I had sex downstairs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">By this time it was getting so good it was all I could think 
        about. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So once again, as with Helga, I got cold feet as far as 
        marriage was concerned. Naturally Alice's Mum and Nellie too were terribly 
        disappointed. But Alice I don't think really minded. A true hippie, she 
        believed in free love.</p>
