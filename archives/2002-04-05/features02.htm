      <p align="left">In the Union trenches around Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia, 
        members of the Sixth Army Corps mourned the passing of their beloved commander, 
        General John Sedgwick, who was recently killed by a sniper's bullet. Thomas 
        Hyde, a graduate of Bowdoin College and, at the time, a staff officer, 
        mourned with his friends. Despite this general sadness, the Civil War 
        continued, and the time for grieving soon passed. Under the direction 
        of the Sixth Corps' new commander, General Horatio G. Wright, Hyde continued 
        to serve as a staff member for headquarters. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since the beginning of May 1864, Ulysses Grant had been 
        hammering, the Army of the Potomac against Robert E. Lee's Confederate 
        Army of Northern Virginia in one continuous struggle to gain an advantage 
        over Lee's stubborn troops. After some intense fighting and strategic 
        maneuvering, the armies met again at Spotsylvania Courthouse, where Lee 
        dug in. While piecemeal fighting went on for days, the main thrust of 
        the Battle of Spotsylvania came on May 12. The initial federal assault 
        was successful. When both sides brought in reinforcements, however, the 
        horror of the Battle finally showed itself.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Sixth Corps had been ordered up to hold the ground around 
        &quot;the bloody angle.&quot; For twenty-two hours in pouring rain, the 
        Northern and Southern armies collided violently with one other. Hyde later 
        recalled that day:<br>

      <p align="left">Its memories are of bloodshed surpassing all former experiences, 
        a desperation in the struggle never before witnessed, of mad rushes, and 
        of as sudden repulses, of guns raised in the air with the butts up and 
        fired over log walls, of our flags in shreds, and at the short intervals 
        which show what small regiments are left.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps one of Hyde's most haunting memories of that battle 
        is when he ordered an artillery section to go and help some infantrymen. 
        He remembered how the gunners went as ordered, crossing over a crest. 
        But there was no firing from the guns. Hyde did not learn the reason for 
        this until the following morning when he found the battery's crew, along 
        with all their horses, dead.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The fight on May 12 was one of the worst in American history. 
        Rain kept pouring down as the two sides engaged in hand to hand combat. 
        As Hyde surveyed the damage the following morning, he came across places 
        where wounded and dead rebels were laying, sometimes four bodies deep 
        in blood and water. When Hyde tried to rescue a rebel officer from a tangled 
        mass of muddy bodies, the man refused his aid by saying, &quot;You have 
        conquered; now I die.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the carnage, Lee did not retreat. He merely redrew 
        his line of earthworks, which signaled that the fight was not over yet. 
        More terrible things were to follow that summer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, just a few weeks later in Washington D.C., another 
        Bowdoin graduate was fighting the Civil War in his own way. William Pitt 
        Fessenden was named Lincoln's new Secretary of the Treasury. Fessenden 
        assumed command of the office on July 5, 1864. The nation's economic situation 
        was not good. The national debt was inching closer to two billion dollars. 
        An estimated eight hundred million dollars was required by the next year, 
        but the government's projected income was only three hundred million dollars. 
        Additionally, it took three million dollars daily to run the War, and 
        the army and navy had not been paid in months.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Before accepting his post in Lincoln's cabinet, Fessenden 
        had already been working a grueling fourteen-hour workday. Now with the 
        Union in financial crisis, he would need to rely even more on his strength. 
        Knowing that his failing health was an impediment, Fessenden reasoned 
        that:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I do not feel like complaining when I think of Frank's [his 
        son] amputated limb, or the many thousands of glorious fellows who bear 
        wounds and suffer patiently and cheerfully because their country demands 
        the sacrifice. All I can do and bear is trifling in comparison.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What Fessenden was doing, however, was far from &quot;trifling 
        in comparison.&quot; The Secretary began his tenure by suspending the 
        issuance of currency. The halt in production of paper money helped to 
        curb currency inflation. The Secretary kept a lid on the production of 
        currency until the end of his tenure.<br>
        Fessenden believed that he needed to pay the men in the armed forces immediately. 
        This was a problem due to the fact that money was tight. The idea of a 
        loan was proposed, and Fessenden went to the armed forces with the following 
        options: the men could have their pay now or further help their government 
        by investing in &quot;seven-thirty&quot; bonds. According to the Treasury 
        Chief, such bonds would yield good interest later on. This &quot;seven-thirty&quot; 
        loan, which was invested in by soldiers themselves, was a success that 
        was responsible for generating more than twenty million dollars.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The &quot;seven-thirty&quot; loans were, however, not so 
        successful when they were being sold to civilians. Fessenden's loan package 
        did not catch on. Entering into an alliance with Philadelphia banker Jay 
        Cooke, Fessenden tried selling his &quot;seven-thirty&quot; loans once 
        again. With Cooke's expertise and aid, the loans finally began to yield 
        money for the treasury. This sucess, of course, was also due to military 
        victories in the field at crucial moments, alongside with Lincoln's reelection.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Looking back at Fessenden's brief tenure in the Treasury 
        Department, the Secretary's biographer, Charles Jellison, noted that his 
        performance &quot;had been in no way spectacular.&quot; Fessenden, Jellison 
        argued, stuck mostly to his predecessor's policies in many ways. Still, 
        the Bowdoin graduate held the nation's finances together during a difficult 
        period. He had been instrumental in the functioning of the Northern war 
        effort, had helped rid the Treasury Department of corrupt officials, and 
        had also been responsible for petty office tasks, such as being responsible 
        for the sale of confiscated cotton from the South.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As William Pitt Fessenden stepped down from the Lincoln 
        cabinet in the early days of 1865, he left knowing he did all that was 
        asked of him. As he returned to the Senate, there was no way Fessenden 
        could have forseen the trials that the nation would soon face following 
        the death of Abraham Lincoln.<br>
