      <p align="left">A two-year adventure in bicameral student government ended 
        this week as a referendum to revise the constitution passed by a wide 
        margin. Students pulled virtual levers in an online poll that garnered 
        18 percent turnout, and the measure passed with 78 percent of the vote. 
        It was the third revision of the student government in three years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The referendum, ratified last week by the Student Congress 
        in an 18-2 vote before the campus-wide poll, brings major changes to the 
        current student government structure. Currently, student government has 
        two houses, the Student Congress and the Student Executive Board (SEB).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The biggest change,&quot; SEB chair Megan MacNeil 
        '03 said, &quot;is getting rid of the executive board.&quot; The new system, 
        to be inaugurated next year, calls for a president and five vice-presidents 
        to be added to the Student Government, which will assume the combined 
        functions of the Congress and the SEB.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Vice-Presidents will oversee standing committees which 
        mirror some of the influential College committees: student affairs, academic 
        affairs, facilities, student government affairs, and student organizations. 
        Current student leaders said that the committee structure will counter 
        a tendency of the current system to place too much responsibility on the 
        chair of the SEB.<br>
      </p>

            Executive Board at a recent gathering in Smith Union. After a constitutional 
            referendum, student government will undergo massive changes. (Henry 
            Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Some members of student government were concerned that the 
        motion to alter the constitution was pushed through Student Congress too 
        fast. Joanie Taylor '03 said that &quot;the proposed changes were brought 
        up late in the year&quot; and that the Congress had considered voting 
        on the ratification prior to spring break. Taylor said that she voted 
        for the changes both in the Congress and the student vote. &quot;The other 
        system just wasn't working for Bowdoin,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mike Taylor '02, who voted against the measure in the March 
        27 meeting, said that the plan contained &quot;too many unknown questions,&quot; 
        such as planning for the possibility that not enough students would run 
        for election to fill all the seats.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Online elections for the President and Vice-Presidents will 
        be held next week.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Others in student government lauded the new system as a 
        needed bypass around structural difficulties inherent in the current constitution. 
        MacNeil said that the vice-presidential system will ensure a wider distribution 
        of responsibility across the government. Ed MacKenzie '03 said that having 
        &quot;a point person for every issue,&quot; the Vice-Presidents, will 
        make government more responsive to concerns of the student body.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The new constitution specifies that the President must have 
        at least one year of previous experience in student government. An amendment 
        that would have held the five Vice-Presidents to the same rule was withdrawn 
        after debate. Jon Staley '03, the IHC representative who brought the motion, 
        said that he would have preferred the Vice-Presidents to have a year of 
        experience. &quot;Overall,&quot; he said, &quot;I think the proposed changes 
        are good.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many members of the Congress and the SEB said they expected 
        the new system to be more intelligible to the student body at large. In 
        the 1999-2000 academic year students ratified a constitution that created 
        a second body, then called Student Assembly, which was added to the executive 
        board, or E9. The Student Assembly was composed of elected class representatives 
        as well as the Vice-Presidents of the college houses, a representative 
        of the Inter-House Council, and the SAFC chair.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last year, minor changes to the constitution transformed 
        Student Assembly into Student Congress, and the E9 into the SEB. The waves 
        of amendments left some members of student government suspecting that 
        student body had lost track of who was responsible for what. &quot;Students 
        didn't really understand what the different parts of student government 
        did, and why there were so many parts,&quot; MacNeil said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a related move, the Inter-House Council, or IHC, proposed 
        to modify its constitution to allow college houses to vote for their representatives 
        to student government. Currently, the Vice-Presidents of college houses 
        are automatically representatives to Student Congress. Under the IHC plan, 
        any house affiliate, including house officers, could run for the representative 
        position.</p>
