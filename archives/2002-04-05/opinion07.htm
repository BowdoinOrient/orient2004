      <p align="left"><font size="5">The anti-capitalist Republicans<br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font> </font></p>
      <p>When people hear the word Republican, one of their set reactions is to 
        connect the word with &quot;capitalism.&quot; The same is true with Democrats 
        and &quot;socialism.&quot; Conservatives are constantly and loudly proclaiming 
        that they are more pro-business and pro-capitalism than liberals, only 
        increasing their volume with history's recent discrediting of socialism 
        as a viable form of government. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In a historical sense, Republicans are correct. Competition is much more 
        efficient for an economy than state-management. However, in recent years, 
        the Republican Party has abandoned the mantle of pro-market capitalism 
        and is now as anti-free markets as the Democrats ever were. <br>
      </p>
      <p>What, you say? Republicans anti-capitalist? Yes, it is a sad thing. Just 
        when free-market capitalism becomes the almost-universally accepted economic 
        archetype, those who have championed it for so many years now abandon 
        it. How are they doing it? By destroying the field of competition upon 
        which capitalism produces such amazing results. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The maximum efficiency from a capitalist system comes when each actor 
        has a relatively level starting point, thus allowing the truly brilliant 
        to rise and the inefficient to fall. As members of the free market, we 
        compete for maximum efficiency.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Republicans have abandoned the principle of the free market. They 
        now serve the interest of those who are already wealthy, to the detriment 
        of competition. As far back as a century ago, Teddy Roosevelt and other 
        progressively-minded individuals realized that when one accrues a great 
        amount of wealth and uses it to stifle any competition, they are ultimately 
        undermining the principles of a capitalist economic system. The result 
        of this realization was the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, a cornerstone of the 
        government's efforts to ensure that the capitalist system had a somewhat-reasonably 
        level playing field. Only when the playing field is level can we all benefit 
        from the market's efficiency and Smith's great &quot;invisible hand.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>For the Republican Party, the principles of the market and equal competition 
        have gone totally to the wayside. Big business and wealthy interests have 
        more influence in this White House than any prior. Not since 1896 when 
        the iron monopoly bought the election for William McKinley (I'll let you 
        draw your own modern-day parallels here), has there been a President so 
        beholden to corporate interests. As the Enron scandal revealed, the White 
        House did not consult with anyone except the established energy providing 
        firms when authoring its energy policy. Consumers, those with alternative 
        ideas, anyone who did not have an enormous amount of accrued wealth, were 
        totally ignored. In the Bush White House, wealth is regulating itself, 
        thereby ensuring that any potential competition that would threaten its 
        current position will be squelched by the government.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Or let's take the &quot;tax cut.&quot; What does the tax cut mean for 
        the average American? At most a few hundred dollars less in taxes per 
        annum. For the wealthiest one to two percent of the population, it could 
        mean tens, even hundreds, of thousands of dollars more in income every 
        year. This is not a new phenomenon. Look at the bailouts of Chrysler and 
        the Savings and Loan industry in the 1980's. Who were the real beneficiaries 
        there? It was not the autoworkers in Detroit or the elderly couples who 
        lost it all when the local savings and loan collapsed under the weight 
        of bad debt. It was Lee Iacocca's fellow board members and Charles Keating 
        and other swindlers who convinced Congress to deregulate their business 
        in the first place. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Why have Republicans lost their advocacy for the free markets? Power. 
        They spent so long in the wilderness that once they returned to the ranks 
        of leadership they became drunk on power. So convinced are they of their 
        own correctness that many Republicans think they are doing the right thing 
        when they take millions from the wealthy and corporations to influence 
        legislation. Their fiscal austerity has been abandoned for profligate 
        squandering and money reigns naked and unashamed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Every year under Republicans the gap between rich and poor grows. Corporate 
        power, in both our government and daily lives, grows. Now is the time 
        when government should strive to the utmost to preserve the competition 
        upon which our system is based. Instead, the Republicans are tilting that 
        field in favor of big business. If I may close by quoting Supreme Court 
        Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, upon learning that Al Gore had won the popular 
        vote, &quot;Oh that's just horrible.&quot; </p>
