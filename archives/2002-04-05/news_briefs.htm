      <p align="left"><b>Britain mourns the loss of their Queen Mum</b><br>
        Queen Elizabeth died in her sleep in Windsor Castle last weekend at the 
        age of 101.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Born Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lydon in 1900, she 
        became queen when her husband was crowned King George VI in 1936. A pillar 
        of British strength during the German blitz of World War II, Elizabeth 
        remained queen until her husband's death in 1952. At that point her daughter, 
        Queen Elizabeth II, took the throne.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Widely regarded as the grandmother of all Britons, the nation 
        mourned the loss of this maternal figure.</p>
      <p><b>Bush administration seeks Middle East solution</b><br>
        As tension builds between the Israeli and Palestinian nations, the Bush 
        White House is struggling to effectively resolve conflict. As violence 
        has increased in the past few weeks, the United States and the United 
        Nations are becoming increasingly interested in halting the conflict.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though the implementation of a cease-fire agreement would be ideal, Bush 
        and his advisors are currently determining the best course of action. 
      </p>
      <p>According to political analysts, the United States is left with three 
        main options for course of action. The first includes allowing the exile 
        of Yassir Arafat, while the second contradicts this, and suggests keeping 
        a watchful eye over Israeli military action while allowing Arafat to maintain 
        power. The third and increasingly popular possibility entails leading 
        discussions of security and political issues with Israeli and Palestinian 
        officials at the same time, as the two points are closely related.</p>
      <p><b>Hundreds arrested in Afghan bomb plot</b><br>
        Numbers as high as 700 are being given regarding the number of those arrested 
        under suspicion of being involved in a bombing plot that would have wreaked 
        havoc upon the Afghanistan capitol of Kabul.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though many of the details remain vague at this time, bombing targets 
        were believed to include the interim government of Hamid Karzai and former 
        king, Mohammad Zahir Shah.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The bombing plot was designed to weaken and hopefully topple the American 
        supported interim government.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Along with the several hundred who have been arrested, many of their 
        weapons were discovered and confiscated. </p>
      <p><b>Pope John Paul II named in molestation case</b><br>
        A case was filed Wednesday in St. Petersburg, Florida, naming Pope John 
        Paul II in one of the many sexual abuse cases that have recently come 
        to light. The Pope is not accused of sexual abuse, he is, however, being 
        accused of relocating Catholic priests who were under suspicion of abuse.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One case cites the Pope as relocating a Florida priest to New Jersey 
        immediately after local Tampa police began an investigation. Other cases 
        involve harboring and protecting known pedophiles.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Florida lawyer heading these cases, Jeffrey R. Anderson, has little 
        doubt regarding the difficulty of successfully suing the Vatican, citing 
        an international case of obstruction of justice.</p>
      <p><b>Teen gets life in Dartmouth murders</b><br>
        Robert Tulloch, who stood trial for the slaying of Half and Suzanne Zantop-both 
        Dartmouth professors-in January of 2001, reversed his plea of not-guilty 
        yesterday, effectively ending the case against him.<br>
      </p>
      <p>His accomplice, James Parker, had pled guilty to the charges against 
        him, and agreed to testify against Tulloch in a plea bargain that resulted 
        in 25 years in prison.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Tulloch, however, who had maintained his innocence up until this 
        point, will now serve life in prison without parole for first-degree murder.</p>
