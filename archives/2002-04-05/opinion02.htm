      <p align="left"><font size="5">College faculty out of touch with the U.S.<br>
        <font size="2">GIL BARNDOLLAR</font> </font></p>
      <p align="left">It should probably come as little surprise, but a recent 
        survey by pollster Frank Luntz added further evidence that the faculty 
        at our elite universities and colleges are increasingly out of touch with 
        America. </p>
      <p align="left">Luntz questioned Ivy League humanities professors on their 
        political views, and the results speak for themselves. Only three percent 
        of professors considered themselves to be Republican, versus 57 percent 
        who called themselves Democrats. Zero percent labeled themselves conservative. 
        <br>
        The professors chose our impeached perjurer-in-chief Bill Clinton as the 
        best president of the last 40 years with a plurality of 26 percent, while 
        Ronald Reagan, the man who defeated communism and revitalized the economy, 
        came in a distant fifth with four percent. Even in the wake of September 
        11, with President Bush's popularity sky-high, only six percent of those 
        polled would admit to having voted for him.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On most individual issues, professors similarly to the left 
        of mainstream America. Seventy-four percent opposed spending money on 
        missile defense research, versus the 70 percent of Americans that support 
        missile defense. Forty percent of professors supported reparations for 
        slavery; just 11 percent of Americans do.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Granted, I don't go to an Ivy League school; I missed the 
        cut at a couple of them. But there is little reason to believe a similar 
        poll taken here at Bowdoin would have different results. I can remember 
        one of my history teachers last fall making plenty of jokes about then-candidate 
        Bush's intelligence. Another professor gave the class an article by that 
        professional anti-American, Edward Said. And about a week after September 
        11, a faculty panel was called to discuss possible reactions to the bombings. 
        The mood was overwhelmingly liberal, with most of the panel members dwelling 
        on how American policies had enraged the Arab world. One girl in the audience 
        even had the gall to say of the bombings, &quot;This is the sort of thing 
        the United States does to other countries all the time.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After the President's address was shown, the panel's reaction 
        was similarly negative. A speech that received a 90 percent approval rating 
        nationwide was dubbed &quot;simplistic&quot; here at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This problem of a leftist bias in academia has existed for 
        decades now, ever since radicals stormed American campuses in their wrong-headed 
        crusade on behalf of North Vietnam's communist butchers. It is now basically 
        a given that the majority of college professors in this country run the 
        gamut from liberal to neo-Marxist. When the Soviet Union fell, the university 
        intellectuals simply shifted their support to a new ideology: political 
        correctness. Strict speech codes have become the norm on many campuses. 
        Instead of encouraging dissent, the college left has become an institution 
        that stifles it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the wake of September 11, far from being supposedly scared 
        into silence, our campus intellectuals have been especially vociferous 
        in their anti-Americanism. A physics professor at UMass-Amherst called 
        our flag &quot;a symbol of terrorism and death and fear and destruction 
        and oppression.&quot; Brown University rushed out &quot;a curriculum guide 
        on how to discuss the attacks in the classroom...that called for understanding 
        why people resent the United States.&quot; According to The New York Times, 
        &quot;an emeritus professor...agonized over why the United States was 
        the most violent nation on earth and ended by saying 'We are complicit'&quot; 
        at Haverford College, one of our fellow small liberal arts schools.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now does all of this mean that a liberal arts education 
        in this country is irredeemably poisoned by political bias? No. I would 
        hope I wouldn't make my parents waste a small fortune on college if that 
        were the case. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But we should all take care to examine the biases and qualifications 
        of those who teach us. As a French diplomat once remarked, &quot;An intellectual 
        is a person knowledgeable in one field who speaks out only in others.&quot;</p>
