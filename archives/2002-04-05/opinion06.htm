        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font> </font></p>
      <p>Church composer Isaac Watts ends his famous hymn &quot;Oh God Our Help 
        in Ages Past&quot; with the verse &quot;Time, like an ever-rolling stream, 
        bears all its sons away; they fly, forgotten, as a dream dies at the opening 
        day.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a child, I recall singing this hymn on warm Sunday mornings. Hearing 
        the words &quot;opening day&quot; at the conclusion always made me wish 
        that I could bolt from my stuffy pew and go play baseball. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, the hymn was written in 1719 and has nothing to do with baseball. 
        It is actually based on Psalm 90 and invokes the insignificance and humility 
        of man in the presence of God, the creator and redeemer. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, on an admittedly superficial level, the hymn does have some 
        accidental parallels to baseball. Such parallels are appropriate to discuss 
        given that baseball's opening day was earlier this week. The hymn illuminates 
        one of the three primary reasons why baseball appeals to many writers. 
        In America, baseball has almost a spiritual or religious quality to it. 
        Add the game's relaxing pace and universal familiarity, and the sport 
        becomes a natural topic choice for great writers such as John Updike, 
        George Will, and David Halberstam.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Baseball commands a reverence in our society that is analogous in some 
        ways to religion. The aphorism &quot;no man is greater than the game&quot; 
        serves as the golden rule of baseball in the same way that man is humbled 
        in Watts's hymn. It is under this pretense that the commissioner of baseball 
        may discipline individuals for violating the &quot;best interests of baseball.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>One sees this reverence for the game in many contemporary players as 
        well. Last year, Cal Ripken Jr. embodied such an appreciation for the 
        game's history and lore by gallantly accepting the praise and applause 
        at every city where the Orioles played. The recurring theme(why not leitmotif 
        here, it means the same thing) was an understanding that the career of 
        one single player, regardless of his accomplishments, is finite. Even 
        baseball's magnanimous men are mortal. Conversely, the game qua game is 
        eternal in the minds of most Americans. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to baseball's spiritual element, author Nicholas Dawidoff 
        argued on National Public Radio's Sunday Weekend Edition that baseball 
        appeals to writers because it is a topic familiar to almost every American. 
        Whether or not one has actually played the game, most are familiar with 
        its metaphors or expressions. In how many other countries could &quot;Three 
        strikes and you're out&quot; become part of a penal code? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Baseball also has seasonal and psychological factors that are conducive 
        to writing. It is a game intended to be played in the invigorating light 
        of the mid-year months. The late A. Bartlett Giamatti, baseball's seventh 
        commissioner and former Yale President, wrote that baseball &quot;comes 
        to us in the spring&#133; it stays with us through summer evenings and 
        the autumn, and then it leaves us when the cold rains fall to face the 
        winter alone.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>There is indeed something romantic and almost spiritual about the &quot;summer 
        evenings&quot; Giamatti invokes. Most of us have the memory of either 
        playing or witnessing games in such conditions. Our parents may even remember 
        sitting outside on the back porch and listening to games on the radio 
        on a careless summer night. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Baseball's pace reflects the relaxed weather of the season. George Will 
        writes that it is &quot;a game of episodic action.&quot; It is the only 
        major sport played without a clock and has many lulls and pauses. Although 
        some find this aspect of baseball to be boring, I find that it is a perfect 
        complement to the sport's idyllic summer season. Rather than having to 
        fixate oneself permanently on the game, baseball offers the fan ample 
        opportunities for thought, contemplation, meditation, or as one friend 
        of mine put it recently, &quot;inane banter.&quot; All of these forms 
        of mental exercise facilitate writers in transforming the seemingly prosaic 
        activity of a swinging batter into such masterful stories as &quot;Casey 
        at the Bat&quot; and &quot;Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Yet regardless of baseball writing's temporal motivations, the best writing 
        reflects the game's ritualistic element. Like a religion, the traditions 
        and customs of baseball connect generations. I believe this is best expressed 
        at the conclusion of W.P. Kinsella's baseball classic Shoeless Joe, where 
        the son resurrects his father by building a baseball field and plays catch 
        with him. In this scene, as in the American psyche, baseball is eternal. 
        Like God in Isaac Watts's hymn, baseball has a Trinitarian purpose. It 
        is &quot;our help in ages past, our hope for years to come,&quot; and 
        ultimately &quot;our eternal home.&quot; May we always be safe.</p>
