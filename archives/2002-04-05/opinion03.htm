      <p align="left"><font size="5">Is it possible to be an amoeba at Bowdoin?<br>
        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font></font><br>
        <br>
        Ah, spring is in the air. Warmer weather, longer days, girls in short 
        skirts and shirtless guys playing catch on the quad. Yes, the mating season 
        has come to Bowdoin and everyone is feeling a little frisky. Everyone, 
        that is, except for those students who are not interested in the opposite 
        sex, or their own sex, or any sex for that matter. I have written about 
        gay students and straight students, but what about the percentage of students 
        who are not sexually oriented at all? That is why this week I investigate 
        ASEXUALITY.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Long ago, old bachelor uncles and spinster aunts were commonplace. 
        Then society became more educated and accepting and many of these people 
        came out of the closet. The rest of them passed away, having never gotten 
        over that long-lost love who perished in the war. But what about the ones 
        that were neither homosexual nor heterosexual? Is it inconceivable that 
        there are some people in this world who are actually not sexual beings 
        at all? Can human beings really be asexual?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Andy is a Bowdoin student who appears to defy the statistic 
        that adolescent boys think about sex 17 times in an hour. His friends 
        were quite confused as they tried to figure out if he was gay or straight. 
        He never hooked up with anyone or had crushes. It wasn't that he didn't 
        like to have fun; he went out every night of every weekend and even some 
        weeknights. He just did not have a sexual preference. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Finally, Andy's friends had to accept the fact that he was 
        asexual. He now lives with a bunch of his teammates-last spring, they 
        all fought (albeit behind his back) over who would be his roommate, because 
        everyone knew that a roommate of Andy's would never be sexiled.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Claire is much like Andy. In fact, they are good friends 
        and will often order pizza together at the end of a night when all of 
        their friends have left parties with their respective significant others 
        or random hookups. Sometimes they even prank call them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Claire and Andy have never hooked up, though. Claire's friends 
        wonder about her. They don't understand why she never flirts with anyone 
        or thinks someone-anyone, male or female-is hot. Lots of people think 
        Claire is hot, but she rejects all advances from girls and guys. Why? 
        No one can figure it out. She says she dated people in high school, but 
        who knows what that means?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Asexuality is especially enigmatic in a college environment 
        where hormones are raging. Some people are relationship people and some 
        people fear commitment, but almost everyone is looking for some sort of 
        fulfillment, be it sexual, emotional, or both. So how can some people 
        lack this drive?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jill tells of her experience with Andy (yes, that same Andy): 
        &quot;I had a crush on him for so long, I mean he's a cool, good-looking 
        ___-player who's really nice and really smart!&quot; Note: Jill is a cute, 
        smart, fun girl as well. &quot;We talked and emailed for what seemed like 
        forever. He never asked me out and never even tried to kiss me. I thought 
        he might be shy, but finally his roommate explained to me that that's 
        just the way Andy is. He's asexual. We're still good friends, but I just 
        had to come to terms with the fact that nothing is ever going to happen.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Asexuality is not necessarily the same thing as celibacy 
        (as demonstrated by recent scandals within the Catholic Church). Asexual 
        people don't necessarily scorn sexuality (homo- or hetero-), but simply 
        do not feel the drive that so many of us do. It seems that some people 
        really just might not feel compelled to seek out sex. While Claire would 
        probably never actually call herself &quot;asexual,&quot; when I asked 
        her why she is never attracted to anyone, she replied, &quot;I don't know. 
        It never really occurs to me.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is, of course, entirely possible that Claire or Andy 
        will one day meet a man or woman who changes the way they feel about the 
        world and they will fall madly in love. It is also equally possible that 
        Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston will divorce one day and both be on the 
        market again-celebrity marriages rarely last. In both cases though, you 
        never really know-but either way, it's not really relevant to the issue 
        at hand.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In short, it seems that some people are simply not as preoccupied 
        with sex as most college students are. It's always hard for a girl to 
        find out that the guy she likes is gay, but she will eventually accept 
        it. So why is it so hard for her to accept that he might be asexual? As 
        strange as it might sound, asexuality is really just a matter of diversity. 
        Just as some people think sports are a waste of time and others can't 
        understand why anyone would want to be a math major, some people, for 
        whatever reason, don't think about sex. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I don't know why some people think about sex less than others. 
        I certainly don't have the scientific resources to get to the bottom of 
        it, although I doubt that it is hormonal. But I have found that such is 
        the way of the world and people are who are asexual just are. My only 
        question is this: if a person is asexual, do they still read my sex column?</p>
