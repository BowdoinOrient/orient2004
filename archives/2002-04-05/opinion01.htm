      <p>On September 11, as the news was breaking, I was writing an article about 
        the dying art of letter writing. I never finished it, nor did I return 
        to it. In fact, I deleted the article, possibly because of a brief notion 
        that the dying art should be allowed to die. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, it was a very brief notion, because I am a letter writer. I try 
        to write at least one good letter every week. Someone recently accused 
        me of leading a whole &quot;separate epistolary existence,&quot; which 
        is probably true.<br>
      </p>
      <p>No recipient exists this week, however, or perhaps there are many. It 
        has always been my habit to use pronouns when I'm trying to be vague or 
        trying to leave certain things out, and I suppose the same might be said 
        of addressing a letter to an indefinite recipient. In this case, however, 
        there is a significant difference. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This letter reflects my private voice in a public space, and I have always 
        made a particular distinction between my public and private voices in 
        writing, but somehow, today, I know I'm very consciously playing with 
        those lines. It has been one of those weeks. Perhaps I need not explain 
        any more. We all have our notions of &quot;one of those weeks,&quot; but 
        sometimes I'm not so sure people would understand mine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It has been one of those weeks when a single word or look can send order 
        and control to hell, when the simple lack of a human connection, an interaction 
        cut short because of time, self-control, or adherence to a certain image 
        can kill all semblance of humanity and connectedness. You see, I often 
        find myself grasping for something that I know I am at fault for not having 
        in the first place.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is our duty as students of our surroundings to deconstruct language, 
        to take down the walls of illusion and the constructions that make our 
        lives bearable. But, in more than one sense, language is my one great 
        source of comfort, in spite of the contradictions inherent in upholding 
        such a truth. I am in a minority, I know. People don't base their entire 
        realities on one inviolable (wishful thinking) thing. It's not wise. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I might even say that it's foolish. And our respective pasts teach us 
        to be fools in what will, just as they teach us to be wise in the respects 
        that we are. It has taken me longer than I think it should have to realize 
        how much my past has created my present and will continue to create my 
        future.<br>
      </p>
      <p>My mother used to tell me that I intimidated some of my peers in high 
        school. I thought it was almost funny to think of myself in that way, 
        because I'm nothing more than ordinary. Nothing more, maybe something 
        less. It depends on whom you ask. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The fact remains, however, that I never wanted my identity to be intimidating 
        to anyone. I never constructed it that way. Other people did. It is not 
        enough that we can distort ourselves. Other people must be able to do 
        it for us as well. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The &quot;one of those weeks&quot; week that comes to an end today repeats 
        itself often during what would be all the dark, quiet hours of my life, 
        were it not for all the noise. Frustration lingers long where impermanence 
        rules. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps it must, if only so that it can find a voice, a language. The 
        great, ominous &quot;They&quot; tell me I'll grow out of &quot;this,&quot; 
        out of the contradictions, the frustrations, the questions, whatever &quot;this&quot; 
        could be, and I believe them. I have to, I suppose, or I wouldn't be writing 
        these words to fill this particular space. My opinion is that we do, indeed, 
        have to &quot;grow out of it&quot; when the notion of &quot;one of these 
        weeks&quot; becomes more, oh, common. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, when. We can only move on after we have asked the questions that 
        plague us in the depths of all these passing weeks. The simplest questions 
        are always the hardest to ask.<br>
      </p>
      <p>My question is: How is it that in a world where it takes so little to 
        make us happy, it takes so much to give that little piece of sanctity 
        (or sanity)?</p>
