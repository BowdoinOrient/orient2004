      <p>Coach Connolly praised Jamieson's leadership and hardwork over his career, 
        &quot;He has been a tremendous leader for the past 4 years and it was 
        a great accomplishment.&quot; Jamieson commented on this season's team, 
        noting that &quot;As far as this baseball season goes, we've had a lot 
        of ups and downs in the early going. We have a great group of talented 
        guys who love to play baseball, but we've learned that we have to come 
        to play hard every single day. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Baseball is a strange game, and you have to take the same approach 
        every day, no matter who you are playing. Our coach is constantly telling 
        us that we are playing against the game, not the other team, and on the 
        days that we have played cleanly, we've won. &quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears put the game out of reach with four third inning runs. The 
        rally keyed around Captain Seth Paradis's '02 two run single. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears picked up a second straight victory the next day when they 
        stopped U. Maine-Farmington 2-1. The win upped Bowdoin's record to 7-8 
        on the year. A strong performance by Pat Donahue '04 earned him his first 
        victory in a Bowdoin uniform. The game remained scoreless until the seventh 
        when the Bear's scratched out a run on Manny Lora's '04 RBI single, they 
        would add a second all-important insurance run in the eighth. Farmington 
        managed a run in the top of the ninth before Scott Burochow '03 came in 
        to record the save.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin started the season at .500 as they went 5-5 while on a spring 
        break trip to Homestead, Florida. The trip included victories over Albertus 
        Magnus, Coast Guard Academy, Rutgers-Newark, Colby-Sawyer, and Wheaton. 
        The Bears opened their NESCAC schedule last weekend as they dropped three 
        games in Trinity. This weekend will see Bowdoin travel to Waterville on 
        Friday before playing host to a Saturday afternoon doubleheader against 
        traditional rival Colby in a return to NESCAC competition. Both Jamieson 
        and Connolly are looking forward to the weekend series with Colby. &quot; 
        I have a lot of confidence in the guys that we are going to keep improving 
        every day out there.&quot; Said Jamieson, who continued; With Colby coming 
        up this weekend, we had better start playing our best baseball really 
        soon. It's been nice to have had some home games already, since last year 
        the snow prevented any hopes of such a thing.&quot; </p>
      <p>Connolly added, &quot;I believe that we have achance to get right back 
        in the league race if we play well this weekend.&quot; Connolly also has 
        a good feeling about the rest of the season, believing that the Bears 
        best baseball is ahead of them; &quot;We played well this week and I believe 
        that wewill continue to get better as the year goes along.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this week Rob Metzler '02, tri-captain, was recognized by the 
        National Strength and Conditioning Association as one of its All-Americans. 
        Kristie Miller '02 a Captain of the Bowdoin softball team was also awarded 
        this honor. Bowdoin's strength and conditioning coach Dawn Strout nominated 
        both athletes. The 2002 All-American Strength and Conditioning Athletes 
        are recognized for their athletic accomplishments, academic and personal 
        achievements, community involvement and leadership qualities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Spring is already upon us and there is no better way to celebrate its 
        arrival than by coming out to ballpark and catching a game. So head on 
        over on Saturday afternoon and watch the Bears play their doubleheader 
        against Colby.</p>
