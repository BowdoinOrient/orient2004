      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: I'm worried that a friend of mine has 
        an eating disorder, but I'm not sure. When I brought this up with her, 
        she was angry and said she was fine. As a friend who cares about her, 
        what should I look for, and what should I do? T. F.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear T. F.: Your wondering and worrying about your friend's 
        well being is an important first step towards helping her. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Over 5 million Americans suffer from eating disorders. Among 
        them, women far outnumber men, although there are increasing numbers of 
        men affected. Studies estimate that up to half of female college students 
        consider themselves 'extremely worried' about body image, weight management, 
        or out-of-control eating. Overall, about 15 percent of young women struggle 
        with significantly disordered eating. About 1,000 of these women die each 
        year from complications of anorexia nervosa alone. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The most common eating disorders include anorexia nervosa 
        (food restriction) and bulimia (binging and purging). Most experts would 
        include compulsive exercising in this same family of disorders.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">People with anorexia typically spend a lot of time thinking 
        about eating, food, weight, and body image. They count and recount the 
        calories in every meal, weigh themselves many times a day, and place themselves 
        on severely restricted diets. They often feel &quot;fat&quot; when their 
        weight is normal or even low, and complain of feeling uncomfortable after 
        eating a normal or small meal. They categorize foods as &quot;good&quot; 
        or &quot;bad&quot; and express judgments about themselves or others based 
        on what they eat, how much they eat, and how well they control what they 
        eat.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">People with bulimia will eat large quantities of food at 
        once (&quot;binging&quot;), and then try to get rid of that food by vomiting 
        or using laxatives (&quot;purging&quot;). Their weight gains and losses 
        tend to be rapid. Their food intake varies greatly from one meal to the 
        next. Sometimes they take diuretics to lose fluid weight. They may rush 
        off to the bathroom immediately after each meal, or after a certain meal 
        each day. Some exercise excessively, often without a training goal. Like 
        anorexics, bulimics diet frequently, express fears of becoming fat, and 
        have unusual preoccupations with food.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To help a friend with a possible eating disorder, it's important 
        to remember that the disordered eating likely represents an attempted 
        solution to other problems. It may represent an effort to cope with other 
        struggles and to express the pain of those struggles. A friend might be 
        trying to manage the anxiety of low self-esteem, feelings of helplessness, 
        problems at school, or troubled relationships. Disordered eating and exercising 
        behaviors are intended to be self-protecting, but end up self-destructive 
        and potentially very dangerous.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When you speak to a friend about a possible eating disorder, 
        stay focused on how you feel about what's happening to him or her. Express 
        your concerns about specific changes you've noticed or observations you've 
        made about him or her as a person, not about the disordered eating itself. 
        Prepare yourself for the possibility that you'll make your friend defensive 
        and even angry. Hopefully, in showing support and concern, you'll be able 
        to open the door to talking more and to helping your friend get help.<br>

      <p align="left">Numerous resources may be helpful. You can contact the Counseling 
        Center, the Health Center, or W.A.R.R.I.O.R.S.. The Health and Counseling 
        Services have recently added to their websites a quick and confidential 
        on-line screening test for eating disorders, depression, and alcohol problems. 
        Both websites have information and links for further reading about eating 
        disorders. You can find more information from the American Anorexia and 
        Bulimia Association at www.aabainc.org, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; at <a href="http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu">www.goaskalice.columbia.edu</a>, 
        &quot;Something Fishy&quot; at <a href="http://www.somethingfishy.org">www.somethingfishy.org</a>,

      </p>
      <p align="left">Our culture idealizes distorted body images and lifestyle 
        expectations. We all need to do our part to change this. This includes 
        reaching out to each other and trying to understand and support each other 
        in our struggles. That is the foundation many of us are seeking to build 
        a true sense of community at Bowdoin. The effects could be life changing 
        and life saving.<br>
