      <p>In a close game last Saturday, the Bowdoin Women's Rugby A-side lost 
        to the Northeastern A-side by a score of 7-5. The loss came as a surprise 
        and disappointment to Bowdoin, who had remained undefeated until then.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Northeastern started the game off by scoring a try only several minutes 
        into the half, on a breakaway by the inside center. A successful conversion 
        kick brought the score to 7-0.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Both teams fought equally hard during the rest of the first half. Early 
        in the second half, junior Camilla Yamada scored a try on a breakaway 
        and brought Bowdoin within 2 points of Northeastern. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin dominated the game in the second half, keeping the ball on the 
        opposite side for 33 minutes of the 40-minute frame. The ruggers came 
        close to scoring a second try in a series of attacks at the try line, 
        but the score remained 7-5 at the end of the second half, and Northeastern 
        hung on for the victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Friday's game was frustrating for the Bowdoin ruggers in an overall sense. 
        Several calls made by the official were questionable, and the conditions 
        of the field were poor at best. Patches of grass were missing, dust wafted 
        into players' eyes when dirt was kicked up, and a portion of the field 
        was actually located on the clay dirt of a baseball infield.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Play from Northeastern combined with these conditions spelled trouble 
        for the Bears. The opponents' tight offense, speed, and aggression caught 
        Bowdoin off guard, and disrupted the Bear offense as well. The Bowdoin 
        back line had trouble getting many of their plays out to the wings, where 
        their strength in speed lies. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite a tough loss, the team remained optimistic and together. &quot;No 
        one was angry at the game,&quot; junior Nachel Mathoda said. &quot;We 
        were all supportive of each other, and there has been no blaming.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin B-side squad showed impressive coherence and consistency 
        in the match against the Northeastern B-side. With the leadership of fly 
        half Sarah Jenness '02, Bowdoin scored several tries with successful plays 
        in the back-line. First year Melissa Hayden scored three times, and forward 
        Aubrey Brick '05 scored as well. Sophomore Whitney Alexander made several 
        successful conversion kicks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Coaches Mary Beth and Bob Matthews approach the loss as a learning experience 
        and have challenged players to step up to the challenge of this Saturday's 
        game. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With one regular-season match left, the Bears have been preparing this 
        week for archrival Wellesley. Junior Ellie Doig noted that the team is 
        looking to increase its aggression and to prepare its &quot;mental game&quot; 
        in order to triumph this weekend.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Depending on the Bears' performance against Wellesley and Tufts' final 
        standing in the league, the women could earn a spot in the New England 
        playoffs. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Come support the women's rugby team in their last match of the year, 
        tomorrow at 1:30 behind Farley Field House.</p>
