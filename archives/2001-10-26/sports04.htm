      <p>On a gray and misty morning in Waterville, the Bowdoin Men's Rugby Football 
        Team advanced to the New England Championship Tournament last Saturday, 
        taking a bruising 29-22 victory over archrival Colby.<br>

      <p>The hard-fought match was a testament to the strength of the virile Polar 
        Bears in comparison to the sterile White Mules. After an exemplary season 
        of undefeated play, the Bowdoin lads are now the champions of the Downeast 
        Division for the first time since 1992. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin Rugby plays this weekend for the New England Division II Championship 
        at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, a tournament that promises 
        two brutal and glorious days of rugby.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The defeat of Colby Junior College goes down in Bowdoin Rugby annals 
        as one of its finest days. In front of a legion of screaming fans, the 
        boys in black went toe to toe against Colby's finest. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It must be noted that Colby, which has been renowned in the past for 
        unsportsman-like play and a total lack of socializing skills, was vastly 
        improved over previous years, thanks to a new coaching staff. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, the Mules were not up to the caliber of Bowdoin play. The game's 
        score may not reflect this, but Bowdoin was in command from the match's 
        first minute. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior forward captain Billy &quot;The Responsible Kid&quot; Soares led 
        the Bowdoin pack in their domination of Colby. &quot;Our wings, Jaws [senior 
        Kris Bosse] and Trucky [first year Truc Huynh], shut down their eight-man 
        pickup. From there, we could slam it down their throats every time. On 
        every scrum, we heard screams of pain from their forwards. I loved it,&quot; 
        he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Special note must be made of Rob &quot;Capt. Brown Star&quot; Mandle, 
        senior heartthrob Torrey Liddell, and sophomore hockey star Ryan Chisholm's 
        backrow. Capt. Brown Star provided crucial kicks, while Liddell and Chisholm 
        swept the rear. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both of these backs neutralized Colby's formidable kicking with amazing 
        quickness and dexterity, vanquishing any hope of a Colby victory. <br>
        Additionally, sophomore Will &quot;Yankee lover&quot; Stetler struck fear 
        (and befuddlement) into the hearts of the opposition with his native &quot;Rebel 
        Yell&quot; charge.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This weekend will be the toughest challenge Bowdoin has faced to date. 
        Four teams play for the right to compete in the National Division II Men's 
        Rugby Championship, held this spring. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On Saturday, Bowdoin will face Yale in what promises to be an amazing 
        test of strength. Yale, with one of the largest student bodies upon which 
        to draw in the Division II New England Regional Conference, has the reputation 
        as a hard-hitting and disciplined squad.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin isn't fazed in the least, however. Colorblind junior forward 
        Dave Kirkland accurately encapsulated the feelings of many Bowdoin ruggers 
        regarding the Yalies: &quot;They're a lot of hype,&quot; he said. &quot;I 
        feel that their skills are frivolous. When they meet this boy from Beverly, 
        Mass those fools is going to learn what respect is all about.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Back captain Jason &quot;D'Nunzio&quot; Pietrafitta echoed Kirkland's 
        sentiments (albeit more intelligibly) with his usual eloquent style. &quot;There 
        is no question that we're going to win,&quot; he said. &quot;We have worked 
        too hard and come too far. Our team is that good. I will personally ensure 
        that victory is ours. You have my word on that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>D'Nunzio's threats shouldn't be taken lightly. Bowdoin's backline is 
        one of the best in New England, with many fine players of the highest 
        caliber. Let a rugger like Capt. Brown Star or Dennis &quot;The Wounded 
        Fire God&quot; Kiley get the ball, and the best an opposing team can hope 
        for is a loss of 20 meters. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In a post-game interview last Saturday, Bowdoin head coach and Milkshake 
        Master Rick Scala emphasized the power of the back row. &quot;My B-side 
        players are better than most of the other backs out there,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;We are amazingly fortunate to have such a talented and deep pool 
        of backs. I would have no trouble throwing a rookie like Casper [first 
        year Tom Hazel] or Focus [sophomore Alexis Acevedo] in there. They have 
        that level of talent.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Scala declined to say, however, when senior fa(s)t forward Ari &quot;Flabio&quot; 
        Jasper will make his much anticipated move to fly-half, only muttering 
        something about &quot;a cold day in hell.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin will face either Middlebury or Providence on Sunday, depending 
        on tomorrow's outcome. Providence has been a consistently strong side 
        over the last few years and will be a worthy opponent. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Middlebury is a different story, however. They have allowed only five 
        points in the 2001 season and look to be the toughest opposition Bowdoin 
        will face.<br>
        Already, rumors of Middlebury talking trash are rife, making many Bowdoin 
        ruggers eager to get a chance at defeating these impudent upstarts.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers are optimistic about their chances and have redoubled their 
        training this week. The championship has special meaning for many of the 
        seniors, who have dreamed of this for four years. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Come down to New Haven this weekend and watch your champion Bowdoin ruggers 
        compete for the New England title. GO BLACK!<br>
