      <p align="left">Members of the Bowdoin community gathered at an open budget 
        forum last week where Director of Budgets Gerry Boothby indicated that 
        the past year was a tight one for the College. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Last quarter,&quot; he said, &quot; the numbers were 
        on the downhill.&quot; &quot;The endowment was at $433 million on June 
        30th of this year.&quot; This figure is down from $466 million reported 
        in June 2000.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Boothby said that enrollment exceeded expectations by about 
        50 students last year, yielding $700,000 in unanticipated College revenue. 
        Annual giving also &quot;helped to offset some of the effects&quot; of 
        increased costs, &quot;...but the bottom line was that we squeaked by,&quot; 
        he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Boothby, there is a potential for the College 
        to be looking at a $5 million deficit in five years. He mentioned several 
        factors in this potential deficit problem. &quot;We are facing the rising 
        overall cost of medical insurance,&quot; he said. &quot;The numbers are 
        staggering; it could be in the 30 percent range.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Something like that has to be looked at,&quot; he 
        continued. &quot;Anything above a five percent increase is extraneous 
        to the budget.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Alumni giving, which made up 15 percent of budget revenue 
        last year, is another concern. Next year's working budget estimated a 
        three percent increase in annual giving, a rate of growth roughly equal 
        to the inflation rate. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, uncertain economic times may cause alumni giving 
        to remain flat. &quot;We could be looking at receiving the same amount 
        of money as last year, which would have significant effects,&quot; Boothby 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With a decreased endowment and sputtering economy in the 
        background, the Treasurer's office is watching College spending carefully. 
        &quot;If nothing changes, we'll be at a $1.9 million deficit next year,&quot; 
        Boothby said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is with these newly revised figures that the Budget and 
        Financial Priorities Committee is considering its budget estimates for 
        the next fiscal year, as well as estimates for years through 2005-06.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Boothby said that fiscal policy changes will be used to 
        counteract rising expenses and lower endowment levels. One structural 
        change will be in tuition levels, a change reflective of nationwide trends 
        in higher education cost. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The working figure for next year's hike is 4.5 percent, 
        but Boothby said that the estimate might change during budget committee 
        deliberations. If it went up by five percent instead, he said, the College 
        would yield $177,000 in additional revenue.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The budget director said that raising student fees is not 
        something that the College takes lightly. &quot;In terms of our responsibilities, 
        we have to be very careful [with tuition hikes],&quot; Boothby said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Adding students to Bowdoin is another way to increase receipts. 
        However, according to Clint Huston '02, student representative to the 
        budget committee, the College risks diluting academic as well as other 
        programs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Adding more students is probably not the answer,&quot; 
        he said, due to &quot;the increased academic costs of doing so.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Boothby said that soon-to-be inaugurated College President 
        Barry Mills may play an important role in relieving budget rigidity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The President is committed to going out and raising 
        financial aid dollars,&quot; Boothby said. &quot;He would like to be able 
        to raise money for the incremental cost of our diversity and financial 
        aid programs.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">President Mills has committed to raising $39 million over 
        three years. &quot;If he can do that, we will be able to have a balanced 
        budget for 2002-2003; we'd actually have a slight surplus,&quot; Boothby 
        said. &quot;But anything he raises toward that helps to bring down the 
        level of expenditure in financial aid.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Boothby, there are several steps being considered 
        that offer potential relief. First, he said, is the revisal of salary 
        increase estimates. &quot;Raises will be less,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The budget committee may also limit the IT (Internet technology) 
        spending increase to $124,000 rather than the proposed $224,000, and similarly 
        trim the $2.5 million athletic department budget's increase from $200,000 
        to $100,000. In light of recent studies, Boothby predicted that there 
        would be a lot of discussion about athletics, including the financial 
        emphasis placed on them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cuts in other areas-essentially stemming from putting off 
        any new hiring-could relieve almost $250,000, he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These reductions have yet to be finalized. &quot;We're going 
        to look at the proposals that are on the table,&quot; Boothby said. &quot;If 
        we make those suggested changes, the deficits, starting in 2002-2003, 
        will have an ongoing effect to bring subsequent years down.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're at the very beginning of discussion about the 
        budget,&quot; said Rosemarie Roberts, chair of the Budget and Financial 
        Priorities Committee. &quot;It's early in the process, and we still have 
        a lot of information to collect.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The process is about a month earlier this year; we 
        have to be finished with our recommendations to the President by the end 
        of December,&quot; she added.<br>
        Until that time, Roberts said that the committee would be working diligently 
        on trimming costs and reworking numbers. &quot;We'll be meeting almost 
        weekly,&quot; she said.<br>
