      <p>The Bowdoin Men's Soccer Team clinched the CBB crown on Wednesday afternoon 
        with a 2-0 drubbing of Bates College. Last Saturday, the Polar Bears downed 
        Colby, the other team rounding out the CBB rivalry, by a score of 2-1, 
        and placed themselves in a position to claim statewide bragging rights.<br>
        The two wins clinched a playoff spot in the NESCAC tournament for the 
        Polar Bears, and increased the team's chances of a possible NCAA at-large 
        bid if they end up losing in the upcoming tournament.<br>

      <p>Adding to the celebratory nature of this week's games were the accomplishments 
        of David Bulow, who scored his 14th goal of the season at Colby, and added 
        his 15th and 16th of the year on Wednesday against Bates.<br>
        Bulow now holds the single season scoring mark at Bowdoin and is one away 
        from tying the career goals scored record.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Saturday's game lived up to what a match between the Polar Bears and 
        the White Mules should be: plenty of intensity, physical play, and ultimately, 
        a Bowdoin victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Quickly establishing his authority in the match, the referee tagged a 
        White Mule player with a yellow card just five minutes into the game. 
        The booking did not prevent things from getting chippy, though, as it 
        quickly became evident that Colby couldn't keep up with Bowdoin and was 
        forced to use unorthodox methods to hold the Polar Bears in check.<br>
      </p>
      <p>These tactics seemed to be working for the first thirty minutes of the 
        game, until Jeff Corsetti '02 made a brilliant run from the backfield 
        and ripped the ball into the back of the White Mule net.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Colby managed to squeak a ball past Bowdoin goalkeeper Travis Derr '04 
        at 41:26 in the first half, but just two minutes later, Bulow countered 
        with a nasty strike that careened off the far post and in.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The second half provided little action, despite a Colby player's red 
        card for viciously tackling senior Patrick Bracewell and the resulting 
        man-down play for the rest of the game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The game's highlights included the play of Corsetti, who appeared to 
        be all over the field at times, and the firm composure of senior captain 
        Reeves Livesay in the backfield. He was a significant force in limiting 
        the White Mules to three shots on goal, and the remarkable chances that 
        developed around Bulow.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Against Bates on Wednesday, the Polar Bears used overwhelming defense 
        in the first half and stellar play by Derr in the second to put the Bobcates 
        away, thus capturing the CBB title.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bulow netted a goal in each half, the first set up by Bracewell and the 
        second by both Bracewell and Bart McMann '03.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Not only did Bowdoin establish itself as the best team in Maine, but 
        firmly positioned itself at the top of the NESCAC.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In tomorrow's game against Wesleyan, the last matchup of the regular 
        season, Bowdoin has an opportunity to clinch third place in the tournament, 
        and possibly move to second place. In order for this to happen, the men 
        are hoping that Williams will take down Middlebury in another NESCAC matchup 
        tomorrow.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of Saturday's results, the Polar Bears will have to visit 
        Middlebury on Sunday for the first round of the NESCAC playoffs. They 
        will face either Wesleyan, Trinity, or Bates in the first round.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears hope to make a solid run in the NESCAC championship race this 
        weekend, and have a great chance to make the NCAA's.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Good luck to all our teams this weekend, Go U Bears!</p>
