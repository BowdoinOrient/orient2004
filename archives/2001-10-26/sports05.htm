        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>The women's volleyball team struggled to fulfill high expectations this 
        year, closing out its regular season with a 6-21 record. &quot;We're a 
        stronger team skill-wise this year; we just don't have the record to show 
        it,&quot; said junior Rebecca Geehr.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Geehr, a lack of players contributed to the team's struggle. 
        &quot;It's definitely been a rebuilding year, there's no question about 
        it because of our lack of numbers,&quot; she said. &quot;We had a hard 
        time competing against teams that had twice as many players as we did.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin team, consisting of only eight players, competed against 
        squads with rosters of twelve. &quot;We get so close,&quot; sophomore 
        Erin Philipson said. &quot;We could definitely compete with those teams, 
        but I think that having more players helps them in rotations.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We wanted to go to the NESCAC championships, which we unfortunately 
        didn't make,&quot; Geehr said. &quot;We played the entire season without 
        subs...which left us at a pretty sizeable disadvantage.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We've learned a lot this year,&quot; Philipson added. &quot;It's 
        had its ups and downs, but...because we've worked through it, in my opinion, 
        we've succeeded.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Geehr said that head coach Kellie Bearman was a strong presence within 
        the team. &quot;I think everybody enjoys Kellie; she has a very personalized 
        coaching style and high hopes for the volleyball program. She definitely 
        wants us to be more competitive in NESCAC,&quot; Geehr commented.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Team captains Lindsay Davis '02 and Mara Caruso '03 have helped to lead 
        and inspire the team. &quot;They're doing very well,&quot; Philipson said. 
        &quot;They definitely take the initiative to hold the team together and 
        get everyone pumped up for games. They inspire us; you want to play better 
        for them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I think they had a big challenge ahead of them this season,&quot; 
        Geehr said. &quot;There were a lot of expectations put on the team this 
        year...I think they've done a remarkable job this season by both their 
        example and their words.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Overall team spirit has been strong this fall, as a tough season has 
        pulled all the players together. &quot;Team spirit, at times, is great 
        and very high. It's as if nobody can break that spirit; [the team is] 
        so energized, excited, and full of life,&quot; first year Bennedicta Doe 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We have this stuff called &quot;spike me&quot; that encourages 
        us to play hard; even if we were to win or lose the game, we know that 
        we played our best and gave it our all.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The lone first year on the team, Doe has shown great promise this season. 
        &quot;She has a lot of raw talent and athletic ability,&quot; Geehr asserted. 
        &quot;It was definitely a challenge for us to hone her abilities, but 
        she's made great strides so far.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Doe joined the team with three years of varsity high school experience 
        as a middle-front, right-back, and setter. And although she has improved 
        greatly in her premier season, she is eager to improve her game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Next year, I'm hoping to play more and be more aggressive on the 
        court. I expect more from myself,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm playing with 
        some great girls that make me want to keep going. For that, I really thank 
        them a lot.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team will finish off its season this weekend at the State of Maine 
        tournament. The women are eager to face archrival Colby and end their 
        season with a big win. &quot;There's always been a rivalry between Bowdoin 
        and Colby, I think that carries over to every sport.&quot; Phillipson 
        said. &quot;We're going to go all out this weekend; we're not holding 
        anything back.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's our last weekend, so we're going to give it everything and 
        more. Our goal is to win the whole tournament.&quot;<br>
