      <p align="left">Bowdoin graduate Tim Woodcock '74 recently announced his 
        candidacy to represent the 2nd District of Maine in the United States 
        House of Representatives. The Bangor native explained that economic hardships, 
        coupled with increasing domestic problems, sparked the former city councilman's 
        bid.<br>

      <p align="left">&quot;I've worked in politics as well as health and social 
        services and I'm cognizant of the needs that are facing the people [of 
        Maine].&quot; &quot;We're facing change and we need to prepare for it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Politically active for over 20 years, Woodcock's interest 
        in politics took root at an early age when, as a child, he watched the 
        Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960. &quot;That was such a seminal victory for 
        someone whom I had great admiration for. I think that race energized a 
        lot of young people,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Still, Woodcock had no plans on going into politics during 
        his time at Bowdoin College. A member of fraternity Phi Nu, Woodcock graduated 
        with a double major in French and History, as well as &quot;an unalloyed 
        confidence in the value of a liberal arts education.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After receiving a J.D. from the University of Maine, Woodcock 
        was first drawn to politics as he followed the Watergate hearings, during 
        which he observed the participation of former Maine Congressman William 
        Cohen '62. Woodcock was so impressed with Cohen that he went to Washington 
        to work for the Congressman until 1983, first on his campaigns, then as 
        an aide and finally heading a small senate committee.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After a brief respite from politics in Bangor, Woodcock 
        returned to Washington as a federal prosecutor in 1989 where he was called 
        to serve as an associate counsel during investigations of the Iran-Contra 
        scandal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Upon returning to his native city, Mr. Woodcock took an 
        interest in local politics and served two terms on the Bangor city council. 
        He also served on the boards of various developmental, health, and service 
        organizations. In his involvement in regional politics, Woodcock said 
        he has become increasingly aware of the grave economic crisis facing the 
        2nd district, and it was that crisis which sparked his decision to seek 
        the Republican Party nomination.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The district has an abundance of natural resources 
        and resolute people, but in the last ten years there has been a sharp 
        drop-off in opportunity due to the changing economy. Little has been done 
        to plan for the changes the new economy will create,&quot; Woodcock said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Northern Maine has traditionally had a terrific advantage 
        in logging and other industries due to its natural waterways and coastal 
        access. In recent years, though, the industries that have been the mainstay 
        of our economy have begun to fold and there is not enough opportunity 
        to attract youth. What we're seeing is a mass emigration of an entire 
        generation. The implications of this are staggering.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Teenagers and young adults are leaving to find jobs 
        elsewhere,&quot; Woodcock explained. &quot;As a result, populations are 
        declining and there is an unbelievable strain on the economy.&quot; The 
        falling population and stagnation of the economy have had widespread degenerative 
        effects. The district's infrastructure has become increasingly expensive 
        to support and so in the last few years the property taxes for a dropping 
        population have risen astronomically.<br>
        The district has aged demographically due to the emigration of the young 
        generation. Traditionally, the area had many young people due to the labor 
        it attracted.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a result of the demographic changes, health-care premiums 
        and Medicare costs are rising and becoming unmanageable for rural areas 
        with disappearing economic backbones.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Maine is in another period of economic transition,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;The problem is that we have no plan to deal with it and 
        the situation has reached a point where it's unrealistic to speak about 
        long-term solutions without first reinvigorating the economy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the past, the federal government has evaluated economically 
        distressed regions and coordinated the giving of aid. I think that's what 
        needs to happen here.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Woodcock also acknowledges that the problems facing the 
        2nd district do not end with economics. &quot;There is also a wide-range 
        of domestic issues that need to be dealt with. Also, after September 11, 
        Maine has been put in a unique position. In recent years border funding 
        has decreased in spite of increasing traffic from Canada. In the wake 
        of [the attacks] we will need to find a balance between commercial needs 
        and national security.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the face of the challenges, however, Woodcock remains 
        optimistic. He noted that this is not the first transition that the economy 
        of northern Maine has undergone, and, despite those transitions, the area 
        has regained its prosperity. &quot;It will take work,&quot; he admits, 
        &quot;but if proper measures are taken, life will be breathed back into 
        the economy. Bowdoin's emblem is the eastern sun, and that symbol remains 
        very much a part of Maine.&quot;</p>
