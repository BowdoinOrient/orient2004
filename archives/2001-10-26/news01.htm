      <p align="left">Computing and Information Services administrators have disabled 
        the on-campus ethernet ports of several students in recent weeks at the 
        behest of Sony Music Entertainment, Inc.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For senior Eric Morin, the semester was only a few days 
        old when &quot;one day, I woke up and tried to use my Internet, and it 
        wasn't on.&quot; Morin and a roommate checked some settings on his computer 
        and then spoke to some friends who worked for Computing and Information 
        Services; they did not have an easy explanation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">NetPD, a company that monitors file-sharing networks on 
        behalf of media companies, had spotted Morin's Internet activity. NetPD 
        software observed an Incubus song, &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; which 
        was being downloaded from Morin's computer. Morin said he was unaware 
        that his computer was serving the song up to other Internet users.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an email to CIS, NetPD invoked the Digital Millennium 
        Copyright Act, a 1998 law that has often been invoked in music sharing 
        and DVD copy protection disputes. &quot;We request that you remove the 
        site or delete the infringing sound files,&quot; NetPD wrote, &quot; or 
        that you disable access to this site or the infringing files being offered 
        via your system.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A legal document signed last spring designated Bowdoin as 
        an online service provider (OSP) in the context of the DMCA. Under that 
        law, OSPs have specific obligations to prevent copyright infringement 
        when they are appropriately notified of it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Charles Banks, associate director for network and operations 
        at CIS, said that Bowdoin &quot;is not in search of, or really have interest 
        in what people do on their personal machines. We are not actively pursuing 
        this.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Throughout September and October, six more students were 
        singled out by <br>
        NetPD. One member of the Information Technology Committee said that at 
        least three students were identified this week. Some of the affected students 
        said that their ethernet ports were switched off days before anyone from 
        the College told them why. Morin said that his access was down for 10 
        days before Security contacted him.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another student said that four days passed before she was 
        contacted by Banks, who explained to her what had happened: NetPD noticed 
        that her computer was sharing a specific Michael Jackson song via Aimster, 
        a file-sharing program that uses the popular AOL Instant Messenger network. 
        &quot;I will never download music ever again,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Banks said, &quot;There was no specific regimen of steps 
        in place to deal with this particular issue,&quot; which accounted for 
        the lag time between CIS's legally required action and notification of 
        students. The deans involved and the IT committee will agree on and disseminate 
        guidelines for students concerned about copyright infringement issues 
        &quot;within a week,&quot; Banks said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The policy discussions, which are underway in deans' offices, 
        are now putting CIS's 'takedown' policies temporarily on hold. &quot;Until 
        this policy is rattled out,&quot; Banks said, &quot;we're not taking folks 
        off the Net.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The DMCA directs OSPs to remove offending material &quot;expeditiously&quot;, 
        but does not require immediate action. The law allows OSPs to act within 
        two weeks in order to be able to &quot;putback&quot; user access, once 
        the materials have been removed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">CIS has taken advantage of that two-week window to restore 
        Internet access as soon as possible to the users who were deprived of 
        it. &quot;We certainly do not want to disrupt academic pursuits,&quot; 
        said Banks, &quot;but we are bound by federal law to take some kind of 
        action.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many students said Bowdoin's own current computer use policies 
        were not mentioned in discussions with CIS and deans about the copyright 
        violations. The Information Technology Use Policy, adapted in June 2001, 
        states, &quot;Users must comply with all copyright, trademark, and intellectual 
        property laws,&quot; but does not specifically mention file sharing. The 
        Copyright Policy, also adopted this summer, declares, &quot;As defined 
        in the DMCA, the College will apply 'take down' procedures or block access 
        to materials that are claimed to be in violation of copyright and are 
        properly reported&quot;.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Copyright Policy is online at <a href="http://academic.bowdoin.edu/copyright/index.shtml">http://academic.bowdoin.edu/copyright/index.shtml</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">John Meyers '02 said that the Student Computing Committee 
        has discussed the NetPD reports at two meetings and concluded, &quot;A 
        lot of people weren't aware of the DMCA and the issues around it.&quot; 
        His concerns were echoed by first year Heather Wish, who temporarily lost 
        her Internet access a week ago after downloading the same Incubus song 
        that Morin did. &quot;I feel that the school should tell you about it,&quot; 
        Wish said. &quot;I had no idea.&quot; Meyers said the SCC was bringing 
        its input to the deans and the IT committee and will distribute a letter 
        about the issue &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.<br>
