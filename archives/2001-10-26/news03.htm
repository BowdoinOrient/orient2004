      <p align="left">The U.S. campaign abroad has altered plans for President 
        of the College Emeritus Robert Edwards, who had planned to spend three 
        weeks working in Pakistan. The trip was part of his ongoing effort to 
        aid the development of an undergraduate liberal arts education program 
        at the Aga Khan University, a medical and nursing school in Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm supposed to be there right now, actually,&quot; Edwards said.</p>
      <table width="175" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="left">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/news03_edwards.jpg" width="175" height="228"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td height="20"><font size="2">Robert H. Edwards, President of the College 
            Emeritus. (File Photo, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The purpose of the trip, he explained, was to have a broad series of 
        conversations with educational, political, and business leaders around 
        the country, to discuss the understanding and implications of developing 
        a broader liberal arts program, a type not typically found in Pakistan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Edwards intends to reschedule the trip for the future. In the meantime, 
        he will attend the board's meeting in Paris the second week of November, 
        and he will continue related work here. He is in regular contact with 
        the university, and hopes to meet with Pakistani academics and graduate 
        students within the U.S.</p>
      <p>Edwards, who once lived in Pakistan for four years, has long been involved 
        in work for the university. He had previously been a trustee of the school, 
        and decided to rejoin the board during his last year at Bowdoin in preparation 
        for his retirement.</p>
      <p>Edwards explained that, despite Karachi's distance from the Afghanistan 
        border in northwest Pakistan, the city still is significantly affected 
        by the events. The hospital at the university, for example, has fielded 
        the impact of the refugees and the injured, as it has done for years.</p>
      <p>Edwards reaffirmed his commitment to the work. &quot;This university 
        really has extraordinarily high ambitions, which is to educate a leadership 
        cadre rather in the way in which places like Bowdoin have done for a couple 
        of hundred years in this country. So I won't abandon it, although the 
        ease with which one is going to be able to move in and out of Pakistan 
        is another question,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan, he said, &quot;I must say I watch 
        events with a very heavy heart. I'm not absolutely clear what the long-term 
        goals are of this bombing campaign. The evident need in so much of the 
        Islamic world is for governments that can meet the needs of their people.</p>
      <p>&quot;Terrorism lives in places where there is terrible resentment, and 
        that resentment is usually caused by local conditions. So the great question 
        is how you can create the conditions where terrorism doesn't seem like 
        the easy option it now is in many parts of the world.</p>
      <p>&quot;There's no question in my mind that you've got to root out terrorism, 
        but I have tended to see that very substantially as a matter of police 
        work, economic activities, detection, some limited violence. I worry about 
        broad-scale bombing campaigns, and I would be particularly troubled and 
        very disturbed if we were to broaden that to Iraq or another country.&quot;</p>
