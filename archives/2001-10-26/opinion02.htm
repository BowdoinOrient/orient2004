      <p align="left"><font size="4">Why we can't attack Afghanistan</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>If there's one thing that the anthrax scare has proven to me over the 
        last few weeks, it's that the American government's attack on Afghanistan 
        is, to put it simply, a silly idea. The silly part of it of course isn't 
        the whole eye-for-eye tooth-for-tooth kind of doctrine George W. and the 
        American people generally have been embracing regarding who is responsible 
        for the September 11 tragedy (Osama bin Laden) and &quot;bringing him 
        to justice&quot; (which I suppose means eventually killing him). If this 
        is justice, then let justice be done. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The silly part is the idea that George W. and the American people generally 
        have been clinging to the idea that somehow, some way, our bombing of 
        a distant Muslim-controlled country will fix everything and make us safe 
        again. That the war on terrorism is a war that we can win in the usual 
        way, by blowing stuff up and killing bad guys. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If there's anything these anthrax-contaminated letters, (almost all of 
        them postmarked from Trenton, New Jersey) should say to us Americans, 
        it's the following: the problem, our enemies, the proverbial bad guys, 
        are not hiding in a hollowed-out volcano in Afghanistan. Killing bad guys 
        in Afghanistan or Iraq or Palestine or any foreign country for that matter 
        will not fix the problem, because the problem is not foreign. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both the September 11 attacks and the anthrax attacks came from within 
        U.S. borders. Both attacks seem to have been executed by, though there 
        is no real way to know right now with the anthrax, a small number of people. 
        And most importantly, both attacks were designed to hit American society 
        at its weakest point: So how can we adequately protect ourselves from 
        biological weapons in the mail without having a police officer in a gas 
        mask open every envelope before it gets to its destination? How can we 
        adequately protect ourselves from 19 hijackers armed with box cutters? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The plain answer to both these questions is that we can't. No matter 
        how many people we successfully kill in Afghanistan, no matter how much 
        we improve security at airports and at post offices, it won't be enough. 
        There are quite clearly enough people like bin Laden all over the world, 
        including Trenton, NJ, to make it nearly impossible to kill enough of 
        them to make ourselves completely safe; there will always be cracks in 
        our internal security, as long as we still have civil liberties, that 
        can be exploited. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The argument then that our bombing Afghanistan is necessary so we don't 
        look like wimps, that it's necessary because to do nothing under these 
        circumstances would be a travesty of justice may be perfectly true. I 
        would hardly argue that a known murderer (of 6,000, no less) should be 
        allowed to go unpunished, if only to maintain the rule of law. So, go 
        ahead and get bin Laden. Go ahead and bomb the Taliban. Go ahead and do 
        what you need to do to continue to be a respectable government. Say what 
        you will about justice, Americans; but please, I beg you, don't trick 
        yourselves into believing that killing bin Laden and removing the Taliban 
        makes life any safer here in the United States. </p>
