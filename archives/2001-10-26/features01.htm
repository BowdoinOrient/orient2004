        <font size="2">ANNE McBRIDE<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1905 a former country doctor named Robert Koch won the 
        Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work that proved that the bacterium Bacillus 
        anthracis caused anthrax. The small, free-living cell Koch saw through 
        his microscope has generated much interest in this country over the past 
        few weeks with its appearance in congressional, postal, and media workers. 
        There are several pressing issues about anthrax, including what we know 
        about the bacterium, how it is spread, and the tools we have to fight 
        this invisible enemy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The bacterium and the disease</b><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unlike E. coli and Salmonella, two common bacteria that 
        can cause human disease, B. anthracis belongs to one of only two families 
        of medically relevant bacteria that can produce spores. This resilient 
        dormant form of the bacterium is surrounded by a thick wall, which makes 
        it highly resistant to heat, lack of water, many chemicals, and radiation. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Spores can survive in the soil for decades and are primarily 
        responsible for the occasional anthrax cases found among grazing farm 
        animals. When spores enter the body, they can develop into a rapidly growing 
        bacterial form. These bacteria then produce toxic proteins that cause 
        disease in the host animal.<br>
        Historically, human anthrax cases have been limited to people who work 
        with farm animals or animal products, such as wool or hides. The most 
        dangerous form of anthrax, often called &quot;woolsorter's disease,&quot; 
        is contracted through inhalation of spores. Workers can also contract 
        cutaneous, or skin, anthrax if they have open wounds that come in contact 
        with either infected animals or bacteria in the soil. A very rare form 
        of anthrax has been seen in people who have eaten meat contaminated with 
        anthrax bacteria.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">How can the bacterium's site of entry into the body affect 
        the severity of anthrax? The environment deep inside the lung is favorable 
        for growth of the bacterium. The release of toxins and the spread of the 
        bacteria to neighboring areas and the bloodstream leads to fatal disease. 
        The body, however, has developed numerous defenses to keep invading organisms 
        from reaching this vulnerable part of the lung, from hairs in the nostrils 
        to mucus in the upper respiratory tract.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The inhaled form of anthrax thus requires two conditions. 
        First, the spores must be delivered as a fine powder so that they can 
        slip past the body's defenses. Second, 8,000 to 10,000 spores must be 
        inhaled to lead to disease. Both of these points present obstacles to 
        potential bioterrorists: &quot;milling&quot; anthrax to a form of powder 
        and distributing the powder to infect many individuals are not trivial 
        tasks. In addition, anthrax does not appear to be contagious and therefore 
        is unlikely to increase the number of victims of an anthrax attack.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The arsenal against anthrax</b><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since anthrax is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, 
        a variety of antibiotic drugs can be used to fight the disease. Penicillin, 
        the first antibiotic to come into common use after World War II, is effective 
        against naturally occurring strains of the anthrax bacterium. However, 
        penicillin-resistant strains are readily selected in the laboratory. Therefore, 
        ciprofloxacin, marketed as &quot;Cipro,&quot; is recommended for treatment 
        of people who have been exposed to likely laboratory strains of anthrax. 
        Other antibiotics related to Cipro are also suggested as possible alternatives.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Antibiotic treatment needs to begin as soon as possible 
        after exposure to the bacterium, preferably before the initial flu-like 
        symptoms arise, which can take 1-6 days in the case of inhaled anthrax. 
        Nasal swabs allow the detection of anthrax spores in people who may have 
        breathed in powdered anthrax. Prompt treatment is crucial because damage 
        to the patient is caused by the accumulation of bacterial toxins, and 
        these toxins continue to act after all bacteria have been killed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Vaccination is a complementary approach to antibiotic use 
        in fighting many bacterial diseases. In the 1880's, at the dawn of the 
        age of vaccination, Louis Pasteur developed a vaccine that prevented anthrax 
        in animals. Rather than attacking the bacterium directly, vaccination 
        acts by priming the immune system. When an animal is vaccinated against 
        anthrax and then is exposed to the bacterium, the animal's immune system 
        is ready to mount a swift and intense campaign against the invader. Humans 
        need three initial doses of the anthrax vaccine and yearly boosters for 
        effective protection against future infection.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Protecting public health: present and future</b><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although the increasing number of anthrax cases around the 
        nation is alarming, our response both as individuals and as a community 
        needs to be measured with an eye on the future of fighting infectious 
        diseases. People need to remain alert to suspicious mail, unknown powders 
        and possible symptoms of anthrax, and to seek help if these signs are 
        detected.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the absence of such signs, however, being overly cautious 
        by taking antibiotics or flooding health facilities for anthrax tests 
        could lead to serious consequences. The former could facilitate the development 
        of antibiotic resistance in bacteria other than anthrax. The latter could 
        overwhelm the health care system such that actual cases cannot be treated 
        as quickly as necessary to allow survival.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We have the knowledge and the tools to handle anthrax outbreaks. 
        Now strengthening the public health systems in this country and around 
        the world will be crucial in the continuing battle against microscopic 
        enemies.<br>
