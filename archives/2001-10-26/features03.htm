      <p align="left">For the Democratic Party the Presidential election of 1852 
        was a tough one. Tough not because of the Whig opponent, but because no 
        one could decide between James Buchanan, Stephen A. Douglas, or Lewis 
        Cass. The black horse that rode in at this moment of indecision was New 
        Hampshire native Franklin Pierce of the Bowdoin class of 1824. He was 
        referred to as &quot;Young Hickory&quot; to compare him to Andrew Jackson, 
        whom he was not nor could he ever dream of becoming. The Democrats, in 
        this election, maintained that the federal government was at its best 
        when it was small. The platform was against the founding of a national 
        bank, supported rigid state's rights, proclaimed itself an enemy to abolitionists, 
        and pledged its support to the Compromise of 1850 which contained the 
        very touchy subject of the Fugitive Slave Law.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the other side of the political arena was the Whig Party, 
        soon to be dead in its grave. In 1852 the party nominated General Winfield 
        Scott, hero of the War of 1812 and the Mexican War, recently won. In Maine, 
        William Pitt Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1823 and one time United States 
        Congressman was bitter after Scott compromised his early goals to gain 
        the support of southern Whigs. Pitt Fessenden liked men who stood their 
        ground. But still he was at this point rather powerless and Scott went 
        off to a fight that he could not win.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="167" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="left">

      </table>
      <p align="left">While Pierce was a relatively unknown name, there was dirt 
        in his past and his opponents made sure that it came to light. During 
        the Mexican War, Pierce had been a brigade commander and, in his first 
        real action, he had been severely injured when his horse threw him forward 
        from the saddle. In all of the battles after that point, he would by some 
        ill luck be out of the count and, thus, his reputation as a coward surely 
        came to light in the election.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Writing in his memoirs after his own stint as the President 
        of the United States, Ulysses Grant defended Pierce:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;By an unfortunate fall from his horse on the afternoon 
        of the 19th [of August 1847] he [Pierce] was painfully injured. The next 
        day, when his brigade, with the other troops engaged on the same field, 
        was ordered against the flank and rear of the enemy guarding the different 
        points of the road from San Augustin Tlalpam to the city [Mexico City], 
        General Pierce attempted to accompany them. He was not sufficiently recovered 
        to do so and fainted. This circumstance gave rise to exceedingly unfair 
        and unjust criticisms of him when he became a candidate for the Presidency. 
        Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, 
        he was a gentleman and a man of courage. I was not a supporter of him 
        politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the 
        volunteer generals.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of course these words were written after Pierce was in his 
        grave and after Grant had failed at leading the country through Reconstruction. 
        Going back to the campaign, the results of the election showed that whatever 
        dirt was flung in Pierce's path, he still won a stunning 254 electoral 
        votes to Scott's 42. In the popular vote, however, his victory was not 
        so stunning. Despite that, Franklin Pierce had been elected to the highest 
        office in the land.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tragedy, however, was about to strike. For years the Pierces 
        had been trying to have a family. The first two children had died young 
        and the third, who was eleven years old when his father was elected president, 
        met his end even before the inaugural address. It happened in Massachusetts, 
        when a train crash killed young Benjamin Pierce right before his father's 
        horrified eyes. His mother, Jane Pierce was also there as well. The soon-to-be 
        First Lady, who was also the daughter of former Bowdoin president Jesse 
        Appleton, never recovered from the shock.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce went back to work. His inaugural address showed what 
        the nation could expect from his administration. Abolitionists no doubt 
        were stirred when he said, &quot;I believe that involuntary servitude 
        as it exists in different states of this Confederacy, is recognized by 
        the constitution. I believe that it stands like any other admitted right, 
        and that the states where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies 
        to enforce the constitutional provisions. I hold that the laws of 1850, 
        commonly called the 'compromise measures,' are strictly constitutional 
        and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect&#133;&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And there it was. The administration of Franklin Pierce 
        would not be a friend to the slave and, thus, instead of bringing the 
        nation closer together, it would push the already inflamed situation towards 
        eventual civil war. But it was Pierce's thoughts that this is the way 
        the nation should be run and, by God, he did his best to make it so.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The issues of the land at this time centered primarily on 
        slavery and its possible extension into the lands newly acquired from 
        Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 had averted war, but it had also introduced 
        the concept of &quot;popular sovereignty.&quot; This concept proclaimed 
        that the people living in a territory could decide for themselves whether 
        to join the Union as a slave state or a free one. </p>

      <p align="left">The delicate balance that had held the Union together for 
        so long was suddenly threatened when Senator Stephen A. Douglas introduced 
        a bill that would allow the territories of Kansas and Nebraska to organize 
        as states under popular sovereignty. This act would nullify the Missouri 
        Compromise of 1820 and would allow other states to join the Union in this 
        fashion. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Without a guarantee that slavery would end, there was an 
        outcry in the North. The Republican Party would rise to combat this threat. 
        In the meantime, the Whigs were doing all they could. In 1854, William 
        Pitt Fessenden, no abolitionist but also not a friend of slavery was elected 
        by the State of Maine to serve in the United States Senate. His task was 
        to help defeat the dreaded Kansas-Nebraska act. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Elsewhere, as the fires of the Civil War were beginning 
        to burn, Pitt Fessenden's youngest son, Sam, was watching the proceedings 
        of this crisis with intense interest. Sam Fessenden had been born in the 
        same year and would soon be in the same class at Bowdoin as another Mainer 
        by the name of Thomas Worchester Hyde.<br>
