      <p>To the Editors:<br>
      </p>
      <p>I'm not sure why Todd Buell (&quot;Compassionate Colonialism&quot;, October 
        19) thinks that the &quot;c-word&quot;, as he puts it, isn't to be mentioned 
        in polite academic discourse. A quick search on Bowdoin's spiffy new Web 
        site yields about 30 hits on the word, and quite a few of them involve 
        course descriptions. It seems that we talk about colonialism quite a bit. 
        It's quite true that calls for a return to Western colonialism are rather 
        harder to find, but there may be good reasons for that. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Jonah Goldberg has been musing about 'compassionate colonialism' for 
        over a year now, well before September 11. He writes with a studied vagueness 
        about what he actually means, but it seems to involve the forcible takeover 
        of particular areas, followed by temporary American rule-dig some wells, 
        eradicate malaria, end hunger, accept the thanks of a grateful citizenry 
        and then out again, with the warm glow of a job well done.<br>
      </p>
      <p>African states have led his list of possible colonies, of course; Africa 
        is always the playground of choice for colonial fantasies, and it's a 
        truism of conservative theorizing that Africans can't rule themselves. 
        Apparently, he's now extended the idea to Afghanistan and Iraq. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For the most part, Goldberg's ideas are a sort of Colonialism Lite for 
        the twenty-first century. Consent of the governed is irrelevant and there 
        may have to be some preventive killing of Bad Guys, but it's all to be 
        good clean imperialism, done for the Native's Own Good. (Pith helmets 
        and pukka sahibs-it will, no doubt, make a good movie when suitably cleaned 
        up.) The problem is that such justifications have always accompanied colonial 
        adventures, and they very rarely play out in practice.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Look at America's own experience with protectorates: Haiti, the Dominican 
        Republic, Cuba, and the Philippines today hardly look like good advertisements 
        for such a strategy. The British and French did not seem notably satisfied 
        with the endings of their Age of Empire. Goldberg's favourite strategy 
        for colonial development-in good conservative form, he wants to grant 
        condominiums to multinational corporations-left 10 million people dead 
        in the Congo Free State and has proven one of the worst way to assist 
        regions in economic development. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Historical amnesia is perhaps not the safest state for approaching nation 
        building in Afghanistan and Iran. The modern relationships involved are 
        complex as well. Turkey, a NATO ally and the provider of vital bases for 
        American power projection, has a distinct interest in a crippled and chaotic 
        Iraq. Iran, Uzbekistan and Pakistan, America's new-found and rather tremulous 
        allies in Central Asia, share similar fears of a unified Afghanistan. 
        How are these countries going to perceive American engagement in a twenty-first 
        century version of colonialism on their borders? <br>
      </p>
      <p>It's nice, though mildly startling, to see an American conservative like 
        Goldberg advocate the spending of &quot;...billions and billions of dollars...&quot; 
        in amelioration of living conditions in poor areas of the world. However, 
        there seems a fundamental failure of imagination at work here in the assumption 
        that the only two options for America are to ignore the world outside 
        the frontiers, or to rule it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps some alternative suggestions are in order? One such might involve 
        a re-engagement with the United Nations and with the hard-won knowledge 
        about peace-keeping that a number of countries have accumulated in the 
        course of missions coordinated by that body. Another might involve genuine 
        commitment to assist poor countries in the rehabilitation of their economies, 
        without the primary impulse of Great Power game-playing or protection 
        of banking systems. I think such engagements do rather more to help people 
        in Afghanistan, Iraq, or different parts of Africa than do dreams of a 
        new colonial age. </p>

      <font size="4"><a name="ltr02"></a>Why we can't attack Afghanistan</font><br>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>If there's one thing that the anthrax scare has proven to me over the 
        last few weeks, it's that the American government's attack on Afghanistan 
        is, to put it simply, a silly idea. The silly part of it of course isn't 
        the whole eye-for-eye tooth-for-tooth kind of doctrine George W. and the 
        American people generally have been embracing regarding who is responsible 
        for the September 11 tragedy (Osama bin Laden) and &quot;bringing him 
        to justice&quot; (which I suppose means eventually killing him). If this 
        is justice, then let justice be done. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The silly part is the idea that George W. and the American people generally 
        have been clinging to the idea that somehow, some way, our bombing of 
        a distant Muslim-controlled country will fix everything and make us safe 
        again. That the war on terrorism is a war that we can win in the usual 
        way, by blowing stuff up and killing bad guys. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If there's anything these anthrax-contaminated letters, (almost all of 
        them postmarked from Trenton, New Jersey) should say to us Americans, 
        it's the following: the problem, our enemies, the proverbial bad guys, 
        are not hiding in a hollowed-out volcano in Afghanistan. Killing bad guys 
        in Afghanistan or Iraq or Palestine or any foreign country for that matter 
        will not fix the problem, because the problem is not foreign. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both the September 11 attacks and the anthrax attacks came from within 
        U.S. borders. Both attacks seem to have been executed by, though there 
        is no real way to know right now with the anthrax, a small number of people. 
        And most importantly, both attacks were designed to hit American society 
        at its weakest point: So how can we adequately protect ourselves from 
        biological weapons in the mail without having a police officer in a gas 
        mask open every envelope before it gets to its destination? How can we 
        adequately protect ourselves from 19 hijackers armed with box cutters? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The plain answer to both these questions is that we can't. No matter 
        how many people we successfully kill in Afghanistan, no matter how much 
        we improve security at airports and at post offices, it won't be enough. 
        There are quite clearly enough people like bin Laden all over the world, 
        including Trenton, NJ, to make it nearly impossible to kill enough of 
        them to make ourselves completely safe; there will always be cracks in 
        our internal security, as long as we still have civil liberties, that 
        can be exploited. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The argument then that our bombing Afghanistan is necessary so we don't 
        look like wimps, that it's necessary because to do nothing under these 
        circumstances would be a travesty of justice may be perfectly true. I 
        would hardly argue that a known murderer (of 6,000, no less) should be 
        allowed to go unpunished, if only to maintain the rule of law. So, go 
        ahead and get bin Laden. Go ahead and bomb the Taliban. Go ahead and do 
        what you need to do to continue to be a respectable government. Say what 
        you will about justice, Americans; but please, I beg you, don't trick 
        yourselves into believing that killing bin Laden and removing the Taliban 
        makes life any safer here in the United States. </p>
