      <p align="left"><font size="5"> Economic Update: President Bush, Kyoto, and the economics of global warming</font><br>
        <font size="2">TA HERRERA AND RICK FREEMAN <br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTORS</font></p>
      <p align="left">When President Bush announced in June 2001 that the U.S. 
        would not honor its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol for curbing global 
        warming by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses, he was criticized 
        by environmentalists and others. To date the President has not proposed 
        any alternative approaches to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, leads 
        some to believe he does not take the threat of global warming seriously. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bush's environmental stance aside, many economists and other 
        policy analysts believe the Kyoto Protocol is badly flawed. But if Kyoto 
        is problematic, what do we recommend? We take the threat of global warming 
        seriously and think economic analysis can make an important contribution 
        to policy formulation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since the mid-1970s, earth's atmospheric temperature has 
        risen above the global historical average by about one degree Fahrenheit. 
        Most earth scientists agree this rise is due in large part to the &quot;greenhouse 
        effect,&quot; whereby gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), emitted by 
        humans form a shield preventing dissipation of solar heat away from the 
        earth. A United Nations sponsored group of scientists, the Intergovernmental 
        Panel of Climate Change, predicts that if nothing is done to control emissions 
        of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere 
        will double from pre-industrial levels by the end of this century. The 
        result will be a global average temperature increase of 2.5 to 10.4 degrees 
        Fahrenheit by the year 2100.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If global warming is to be substantially retarded, global 
        emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses must be substantially reduced. 
        This issue was addressed by 160 nations in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997. 
        The result was the Kyoto Protocol, which commits the industrialized nations 
        of the world to reducing emissions of CO2 to about 5 percent below 1990 
        levels by sometime between 2008 and 2012. The Clinton administration signed 
        the Protocol, agreeing to a 7 percent reduction in U.S. emissions. It 
        was this commitment that the Bush administration repudiated this spring.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The problems with the Kyoto Protocol are the following: 
        it did not call for enough reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; it tried 
        to do it too quickly, thereby; imposing higher costs on the world economy 
        than were necessary and justified by the benefits of slowing global warming; 
        and it did not require any actions now or in the future by any developing 
        nations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even if the industrialized nations meet their targets by 
        2012, concentrations of CO2 will continue to grow, in part because of 
        the growing emissions of developing nations (especially China, soon to 
        be the world's largest CO2 emitter, and India) not committing to reductions 
        of their own. Thus, the Kyoto Protocol would delay doubling of CO2 concentrations 
        by only a few years. </p>
      <p align="left">Achieving these reductions by 2012 would cost more than 
        necessary because of the need to retrofit power plants, automobiles, buildings, 
        etc. with currently available technologies, rather than allowing firms 
        to take advantage of normal replacement cycles and the better technologies 
        expected to arise over time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One tool for evaluating policies is &quot;benefit-cost analysis.&quot; 
        A policy is economically desirable only if its benefits outweigh the costs 
        when both are converted into current dollars. Determination of benefits 
        and costs of global warming policy is very difficult for a number of reasons 
        and this makes the evaluation of candidate policies a contentious (though 
        very interesting) undertaking.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The primary problem in evaluating costs and benefits of 
        global warming policies is the magnitude of the scientific and economic 
        uncertainty surrounding the consequences of different policies. For each 
        trajectory of emissions, scientists must forecast not only global average 
        but regional temperatures and precipitation patterns for up to two centuries 
        into the future. The costs and benefits of alternative trajectories of 
        reduced emissions depend on global population, the rate of technological 
        improvement in energy use and emissions control, and how future populations 
        adapt to changing climate. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Comprehensive assessments of alternative policies tend to 
        support modest emissions reductions, but suggest more aggressive proposals 
        would have costs substantially in excess of benefits. However, most assessments 
        do not consider the other environmental benefits (including human health) 
        resulting from reduced use of carbon-based fuels in the energy and transportation 
        sector. There are also substantial uncertainties in all of these estimates; 
        the possibility of unforeseen catastrophic climate responses cannot be 
        ruled out.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Emissions within a country can be reduced via &quot;command 
        and control,&quot; with each polluting firm forced by the government to 
        reduce emissions by some percentage. Such policies neglect the fact that 
        different sources may have radically different costs associated with reducing 
        carbon emissions and therefore do not tend to achieve emission reduction 
        in the least costly way. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Economists generally prefer &quot;economic incentive systems,&quot; 
        such as pollution taxes or tradable permits with strict emissions caps. 
        To keep total global control costs as low as possible, it will be important 
        to use an incentive based system rather than command and control. At an 
        international level, we strongly recommend caps on each country's emissions 
        with trading both within and between nations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The total costs of controlling emissions of CO2 could be 
        substantially reduced if nations were allowed to trade emissions permits 
        with other nations. If the right to emit carbon were a valuable resource, 
        polluters would profit from cleaning up, and industries would develop 
        to reward innovative development of new carbon-reducing technologies. 
        The U.S. has been clear that trading among nations must be part of any 
        framework that it would agree to; the Kyoto Protocol does allow for the 
        development of an emission rights trading system among industrialized 
        nations. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Trading, however, is politically difficult. Many analysts 
        believe that obtaining the agreement of all participating nations in a 
        &quot;fair&quot; allocation of valuable permits is an impossible hurdle. 
        European countries claim they should be given a larger initial share of 
        any newly allocated permits, as a reward for unilateral measures they 
        have taken to reduce carbon emissions. The U.S. views the European claim 
        as an attempt to put U.S. firms at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
