      <p align="left">Bowdoin's collegiate debate team had another excellent showing 
        this week at - wait, what? Bowdoin has a debate team?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That surprise is the general reaction to Bowdoin'd debate 
        team this year, and it is a reaction that the debaters will be trying 
        to change Homecoming weekend, when Bowdoin debate hosts its first tournament 
        in almost 50 years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Bowdoin debate has been non-existent for a long time,&quot; 
        said tournament director Sarah Yantokosol. &quot;This is a chance to showcase 
        just how far its come in such a short time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having gone from non-existent to a team that has placed 
        at every tournament they've attended, Bowdoin debate has indeed come an 
        extremely long way from where it was when President Ali Rau '04 resurrected 
        it from an extended dormancy last year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A debate captain in high school, Rau first realized that 
        Bowdoin had no team only at last year's student activities fair. &quot;I 
        had been excited to debate at the collegiate level, and so when I saw 
        we had no team I went up to Burgie [Howard]. He gave me $75 and an account 
        number, and I went from there.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rau began to hold meetings with the help of Frank Skornia 
        and advisor Sarah Chingos, even though none of them knew how debate was 
        run on the college circuit. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The team's vice president, Lindsay Richman, another veteran 
        of high school debate, joined the squad last January. With the help of 
        veteran Bates debater John Ziegler, the two discovered the American Parliamentary 
        Debate Association (APDA) and readied themselves for competition against 
        established teams such as Harvard, Princeton and Yale.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We walked into our first round at [the tournament 
        at] Wellesley and we had no idea what we were doing,&quot; Rau laughed. 
        &quot;We learned as the tournament went along, though, and we ended up 
        ranking. I guess you could say we had a favorable learning curve.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Due to little initial support, however, debate was unable 
        to take off until this year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It's been a huge surprise. I've been very impressed 
        with the amount of student enthusiasm we've been getting,&quot; said Richman. 
        Where maybe 4 or 5 students attended debate meetings last year, there 
        are almost 20 regular members on this year's squad.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It's been pretty amazing,&quot; Rau agrees. &quot;Not 
        only have the turnouts been great, but we've gotten a lot of help from 
        the activities board. Last year we had 75 dollars for the entire year, 
        but now we've been blessed with almost $1,500 a month!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Still, the challenges seem overwhelming. On APDA, the all-novice 
        Bowdoin team competes with schools such as Harvard, Princeton and Yale. 
        Most are established teams with over 50 members and some have endowments 
        of millions of dollars. &quot;Other teams have talented older members 
        who can teach the novices, but Lindsay and I have had to learn with the 
        new debaters,&quot; Rau said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Luckily, Rau was able to find a teacher in coach Phil Hansen, 
        who brings an enormous amount of debate experience to the team. A former 
        Bowdoin debater and Class of '64 Graduate, Hansen founded the Debate Association 
        of New England Independent Schools while a teacher at the Roxbury Latin 
        School in Boston. Now retired and living in Maine, Hansen was eager to 
        volunteer his services to his Alma Mater. &quot;It really worked like 
        clockwork,&quot; Rau said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With all of its newfound support, Bowdoin teams have drawn 
        heads by ranking at every tournament they've competed in. Recently, at 
        a Harvard Invitational that had over 350 competitors from schools all 
        over the nation, the team of Richman and first-year Matthew Spooner ranked 
        4th out of over 120 novice teams.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Bowdoin is finally making a name for itself,&quot; 
        Richman grinned.<br>
        Encouraged by the team's success, Rau and Richman decided to hold a regional 
        tournament with Bates and Colby this weekend both to warm-up for a national 
        tournament they expect to host at Bowdoin next year and to show the school 
        what debate is all about.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The tournament will begin this Saturday at 12:30 in Smith 
        Auditorium, and rounds will continue throughout the day in Sills Hall. 
        Any students, faculty, and alumni who are interested are encouraged to 
        observe the competition at any point during the afternoon.<br>
      </p>
