        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>Currently on a seven-game roll, the women of field hockey are ready for 
        their NESCAC playoff appearance this weekend.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the middle of that streak, when the Bears (13-2) showed visiting parents 
        what they were made of two weeks ago, the women defeated Connecticut College 
        by a score of 3-0 in their last regular-season home game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin fired eleven shots on goal, and the Camels totaled five against 
        sophomore goaltender Gillian McDonald. She was able to stop every shot, 
        marking her fifth solo shutout of the 2001 season.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Scoring for the Bears in the first half were sophomores Shoshana Kuriloff 
        and Faye Hargate, both unassisted. During the second half of play, Rachel 
        Rones scored the game's final goal after a scramble in front of the Conn 
        net, pushing the Bears to a 3-0 margin of victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Last weekend, the women traveled to Waterville for a showdown with Colby. 
        A scoreless first half made for an exciting second frame. After seven 
        minutes of play, captain Alison Scaduto '02 assisted top scorer Marissa 
        O'Neil '05 for a goal. It was O'Neil's eighth of the season.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears continued their advantage with an unassisted goal from Leah 
        McClure '03, bringing the score to 2-0. The Mules were able to get one 
        by McDonald, but the Scaduto-O'Neil duo combined again with 6:24 remaining 
        on the clock, pushing the score to 3-1.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The following day, the Polar Bears hosted the first round of the NESCAC 
        tournament. Facing the Camels of Conn College once again, the Bears earned 
        a 1-0 win.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Conn College played a lot better than they did the week before,&quot; 
        head coach Nicky Pearson said. &quot;They were coming off a 3-1 win on 
        the turf on Saturday at Bates.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The [team's] performance on Sunday was disappointing in comparison 
        to Saturday. The team knew it, and is practicing hard for this weekend.&quot;<br>
        In other playoff action that same Sunday afternoon, Williams dealt Wesleyan 
        a 4-0 defeat and Amherst conquered Colby, 2-1. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each winner from those games joins top-seeded Middlebury (10-4) at the 
        tournament semifinals tomorrow. The Bears, seeded second in the tournament, 
        play third seed Williams (10-3), while Amherst (12-3) faces off with the 
        Panthers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;There are four very strong teams going into the NESCAC tournament 
        this weekend, and we are one of them,&quot; said junior Jackie Templeton. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both tomorrow's NESCAC semifinals and Sunday's championship game will 
        take place at Middlebury.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;This weekend is going to be really tough,&quot; McDonald said. 
        &quot;Williams is a great team. We are going to have to play our best 
        field hockey to date in order to beat them. If we stay composed, focused 
        and play as a team, we should win.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We didn't play up to our potential when we beat Williams 2-1 in 
        the regular season,&quot; Templeton said. &quot;As a team this past Sunday, 
        while Williams was watching us on the sideline, we didn't play so hot 
        again, against Colby...but won 1-0.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;They have no idea about our potential,&quot; she continued. &quot;If 
        we go out there this weekend, and play like we know how...there will be 
        no stopping us. We are ready to come out strong tomorrow and catch Williams 
        off guard.&quot;<br>
