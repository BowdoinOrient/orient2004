      <p align="left"><font size="5">The Red Sox, hip hop, and politics</font><br>
        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Baseball is nearly upon us, and with the announcement (still 
        pending at the time this column was written) that the bumbling Dan Duquette 
        will be replaced as general manager, it appears as if the Red Sox are 
        moving in the right direction just as dawn begins to break on the 2002 
        season. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Is this yet another sign that anything is possible in the 
        world of sports? Is this year for the Red Sox? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As much as I hope so, probably not. In fact, this year's 
        World Series will likely feature the Yankees and the Mets, the two teams 
        with lucrative television contracts and money to spend on high-priced 
        talent and the two teams that the Red Sox can't beat. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As I have said, baseball is a manifestation of a free market 
        system, and teams with money are able to obtain and consolidate power 
        the way that large successful companies normally do, provided they make 
        the right personnel decisions. This doesn't guarantee perennial championships, 
        but you'd have to be crazy to argue that it does not aversely affect competition. 
        <br>
        Losing the hope that &quot;anything can happen&quot; in sports is a scary 
        thought. Hope and the illusion of gritty, hard-working underdogs beating 
        heavily-favored hegemons are the reasons that many turn to sports as a 
        source of entertainment. It's why everyone loves March Madness, or footage 
        of the 1980 &quot;miracle on ice.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, the reality is that the dream of Horatio Algers 
        is largely dead in baseball. The same could be said of politics, especially 
        regarding the ability of alternate parties to obtain national prominence.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Recently I've found myself lamenting the death of many illusions 
        that I have always held dear to my heart: the death of my belief that 
        &quot;anything&quot; can happen in baseball, the death of God, the death 
        of the illusion that I am a self-respecting individual, and the death 
        of the notion that a third party will ever gain national prominence and 
        bring some semblance of variety to our American democracy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As media regulations continue to be relaxed and the door 
        of corporate conglomeration is kicked further open, media will only become 
        more tied to the same big-money corporate interests that plague politics. 
        The need for politicians to sell themselves to voters the same way that 
        soda and beer companies sell their products to consumers will only be 
        proliferated.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The business of politics is growing, and the Democratic 
        and Republican duopoly will only increase its stranglehold on American 
        democracy. There has been much talk recently about the Bush administration's 
        efforts to help elect a Republican governor of California. The administration's 
        belief is that even if California's electoral votes go to the Democratic 
        candidate in the 2004 election, a Republican governor will force the Democrats 
        to spend resources to win the state. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Maybe this doesn't strike anyone as wrong, or even interesting, 
        but I think it's a clear indication that business thought and ethics have 
        overtaken politics. What I'm primarily concerned with is a way for the 
        Green Party to gain national prominence and win some seats in Congress 
        and the Senate. I'm not a Carhart-wearing treehugger, but I would like 
        to see a viable third party enter into the political spectrum, and the 
        Green Party seems to be the most likely candidate.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our two-party system is certainly not the norm in the world. 
        Most European countries feature several varied political parties, some 
        of which are forced to form coalition governments. In fact, in many European 
        countries, party diversity is institutionalized through proportional representation. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our system does not feature these safeguards. We are essentially 
        dealing with a completely free market. The parties with money are able 
        to buy advertising and fund expensive campaigns with budgets that dwarf 
        other parties. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For this reason, I think the Green Party should make an 
        allegiance with hip-hop music and use charismatic rappers and their large 
        bank accounts to sell the Greens' political cause to the American people. 
        Sports culture normally follows hip-hop culture, and if enough celebrities 
        starting pumping the Green Party, it would begin to grow in popularity 
        and prominence. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hip hop's rebellious anti-establishment culture would mesh 
        well with the Green Party, which should also begin to champion drug policy 
        reform. Am I wrong in thinking that there are a lot of Americans, especially 
        young people, who are willing to listen to politicians who propose reasonable 
        drug policies? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Aside from drug policy reform, the Green Party could support 
        sweeping electoral reforms with a focus on minority disenfranchisement. 
        The statistics concerning the likelihood of having ballots for black voters 
        in Florida disqualified versus white voters are nauseating. I have spent 
        many nights crying myself to sleep unable to shake the image on Katherine 
        Harris looming in my head.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Again, I think that a lot of Americans, especially young 
        people, are ready to listen to different party candidates and think outside 
        the limits of the two mainstream parties. While these subversive views 
        would alienate corporate interests, they could be parlayed into another 
        positive aspect: the removal of corporate money from politics. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This proposal may seem outlandish, but it could work. In 
        the process I think it could serve to reinvigorate hip hop-an industry 
        I feel is losing some momentum. The 1990s were rap's golden age. Starting 
        with Illmatic in 1991, classic rap albums poured out during the early 
        and mid-90s. Now rap is floundering a bit, and finds itself in need of 
        a new angle or a new visionary. I think that angle is politics, and should 
        include a full frontal assault on the national political scene with common 
        sense issues on the platform.</p>
