        <font size="2">ANDREW MINESS</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER </font></p>
      <p align="left"> It is 6:00 a.m.. The guys are already sweating and seem 
        focused on their pattern drills. Coach Paterson is emphasizing the importance 
        of good footwork to a tired yet attentive player on court 2. John Carolan 
        '03 says of the practice, &quot;Dude, with one early practice a week, 
        my game is thriving like Joey Harrington in the Fiesta Bowl!&quot; The 
        intensity at the practice is incredible, and it serves as a constant reminder 
        to the guys on the team of their potential. With two consecutive trips 
        to the NCAA Tournament, the Bowdoin Men's Tennis Team has its eyes set 
        on moving past the Sweet Sixteen, and into the crop of elite Division 
        III teams.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In her fourth year as coach at Bowdoin College, Jane Paterson 
        has compiled an impressive 35-12 record, with obvious improvements each 
        year. So now you may be asking yourself, who are these guys? Here is a 
        list of the members of the Men's Tennis Team (the BEST- kept secret at 
        Bowdoin):<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">1)August Felker '03: After studying away in the fall, Felker 
        returns with big expectations as co-captain. He said that &quot;without 
        question, this is the most talented group of tennis players I've ever 
        stepped on the court with.&quot; High praise coming from a seasoned veteran, 
        characterized by his fiery and relentless spirit on the court. <br>
        Interesting Fact: Felker enjoys listening to some Celine Dion songs before 
        matches!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">2)Colin Joyner '03: Co-Captain Colin Joyner also returns 
        after a semester abroad with great hope for the team. He targets the match 
        against rival MIT as critical to this team's success, but realizes that 
        there are &quot;tough matches before MIT.&quot; Joyner's tremendous work 
        ethic has certainly contributed to his great success in prior years, and 
        that should continue this season.<br>
        Interesting Fact: According to Carolan '03, Joyner &quot;has the strongest 
        trunk on the team.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">3)Louis Plough '03: Plough returns to the court after a 
        long hiatus. Plough spent last spring rehabbing a shoulder injury, and 
        spent the fall abroad. Plough's calm and composed demeanor sets a perfect 
        example for younger players on the team.<br>
        Interesting Fact: Plough attributes his game to the heavy competition 
        he faced growing up in the Pacific Northwes;, adopting a strong baseline 
        game was the only way to go.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">4)John Carolan '04: After a solid rookie season, many expect 
        Carolan to come up big in his second year. Hoping to use the momentum 
        from an impressive fall tournament record, Carolan looks forward to the 
        team's trip to California over spring break.<br>
        Interesting Fact: John likes Dr. Pepper, he likes it a lot.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">5)Pat Soong '04: Soong has said that &quot;the team has 
        the arsenal to make it to the National Championships.&quot; Goals such 
        as these help Soong work hard on the court, but he feels the greatest 
        aspect of the team rests in the mixture of people on it.<br>
        Interesting Fact: Soong believes that his performance on the court is 
        strongly correlated to time spent playing Virtual Tennis (and no, I am 
        not joking)&#133; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">6)Pat Keneally '05: Keneally had a tremendous fall and should 
        carry this over to the spring season. His patient and composed style eases 
        Coach Paterson's worries surrounding his rookie status. Look for big things 
        from Keneally, he leaves it all out on the court.<br>
        Interesting Fact: Keneally's high school doubles partner, Scott Levy, 
        plays for Trinity. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">7)Mac Burke '05: After talking to guys on the team, they 
        informed me that Burke has been lighting it up thus far. A native of St. 
        Louis, Burke brings a big forehand and booming serve to the team. Like 
        Keneally, expect some thunder from this kid.<br>
        Interesting Fact: He enjoys watching <i>Kingpin</i> before big matches.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">8)Thomas (a.k.a. &quot;Bucky&quot;) Jencks '05: Bucky joins 
        the team after playing for the Men's Soccer Team in the fall. Characterized 
        by his serve and volley game, Bucky should make immediate contributions 
        this spring.<br>
        Interesting Fact: Bucky lives in Coleman Dorm.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9)Barrett Lawson '05: Lawson enters his first spring with 
        the Men's Tennis Team, but do not expect Lawson to be intimidated easily. 
        Winning a state championship in his senior year in high school, Lawson 
        knows what it takes to win it all.<br>
        Interesting Fact: Lawson is also an avid bird watcher.</p>
      <p> These nine guys, led by Coach Paterson and Assistant Coach Martin Wilson, 
        have set high standards for themselves. The only way to reach them will 
        be to dedicate themselves entirely to the team and the sport. Now two 
        weeks into the season, the team is preparing for its first match on the 
        road against Wesleyan. After that, it is on to sunny California where 
        the team will take on several high-powered and tough opponents. So the 
        stakes are high early on for the Men's Tennis Team, and if preparation 
        is any indication of performance, expect these Polar Bears to be ready 
        to go come that first match. After watching the team practice, I saw the 
        intensity and devotion of each member. Good things await this team, stay 
        posted for further news. </p>
