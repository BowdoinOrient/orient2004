      <p align="left">Wangari Maathai, the keynote speaker at the Symposium on 
        Race, Justice and the Environment held from February 22nd to 23rd, grew 
        up in Kenya when the government was transitioning from a colonial regime 
        to self-governed democracy. She watched the government sell off public 
        lands and cut down the forests to drive the production of cash crops such 
        as coffee and tea. She noticed how drinking water became scarce and how 
        her peoples' traditions and cultures disappeared with the forests. &quot;God 
        spent from Monday to Friday creating all of nature, the birds, the animals, 
        the land,&quot; Maathai noted, &quot;He spent only Saturday creating Man. 
        If Man was created on Monday, he would have been dead by Tuesday&quot;. 
        Maathai showed the symposium attendees how it was foolish to not realize 
        how humanity's pressing social issues and the environment are interconnected. 
        However, racial issues and environmental issues are rarely addressed on 
        the same page. Is it purely a coincidence that pollution ends up affecting 
        poor and minority communities the most? Is it coincidence that environmental 
        issues are usually the concern of Caucasian upper class society? Do minorities 
        just not care as much about environmental problems? <br>

      <p align="left">These and many other difficult questions concerning the 
        connection between environmental and social justice issues were addressed 
        at the symposium on campus this weekend. The conference began with the 
        Common Hour lecture by Barry Dana, Chief of the Penobscot Nation. Friday 
        night, the movies &quot;Drumbeat for Mother Earth&quot; and &quot;Laid 
        to Waste&quot; were shown, and there were small group discussions held 
        with those who later took part in panel discussions all day Saturday. 
        Panelists from around the world and from the fields of economics, political 
        science, law, medicine, biology, and history spoke on these issues concerning 
        environmental justice. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What is environmental justice? Each speaker brought a unique 
        perception of the environmental problems our world is facing under the 
        increasing pressure of population and human consumption. Wangari Maathai, 
        the keynote speaker for the conference, founded the Green Belt Movement 
        in Kenya which teaches women and community members how the governmental 
        process works through lessons on how to plant indigenous tree species 
        on their land. As a result of her activism, Maathai has been prosecuted 
        by the corrupt Kenyan government, and been imprisoned. </p>
      <p align="left">Rebecca Sockbeson and Barry Dana of the Penebscot Nation 
        explained how the federal and state government regulate the water quality 
        of Maine rivers without taking into consideration how Penobscots rely 
        on the fish as a source of food. As a result of eating fish poisoned with 
        dioxin discharged from paper, babies are born with birth defects and cancer 
        rates on the reservation are abnormally high. In the Rio Grande River 
        Valley, Gilberto Reyes, Jr. explained how the local culture is being removed 
        from the environment by the economic freedom introduced by NAFTA. </p>
      <p align="left">Panel member Eduardo Lao Rhodes from the University of Indiana 
        discussed how environmental problems could be assessed economically, and 
        Bowdoin professor Lance Guo discussed how economic development had changed 
        the nature of East Asian culture. Annette Dula of the Tuskegee Institute 
        spoke of how the Monsanto Corporation dumped tons of PCPs into a creek 
        near a predominantly minority community in Alabama, poisoning thousands 
        of people. She also how a 50 mile stretch of the Mississipi river from 
        Baton Rouge to New Orleans, Lousiana is now called &quot;Cancer Alley&quot; 
        because of the number of chemical processing plants and the resulting 
        high cancer rates. In Harlem, children suffer from asthma as a result 
        of poor air quality, diesel fumes from buses, poor housing, as George 
        Khaldun, Bowdoin gratuate and Chief Operating Officer of the Rheedlen 
        Centers for Children and Families, informed the panel. Even though environmental 
        concern is written into the Brazillian constitution, Vera Karam de Chueiri 
        explained how the regional government allowed a French car factory to 
        be built in a fragile watershed area, compromising the water supply of 
        the city of Curitiba. The list goes on.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Reducing these issues to simply environmental problems allows 
        the public to ignore the awkward issues of social injustice. We hope that 
        we left racism solved back in the 1960's and that since then great measures 
        have been taken to eliminate social stratification so that everyone has 
        equal access to wealth, happiness, and well-being. We don't like to think 
        that 500 years of western exploitation of the New World's people and resources 
        made the Renaissance and society as we know it today possible, as panel 
        speaker Tony Affigne from Providence College reminded the attendees of 
        the symposium. When action is taken against individual environmental pollution 
        issues, difficult problems of racial equality arise and injustices are 
        incurred in the jumble. It is easy to throw up your hands at the immensity 
        of the problems and &quot;become a guilt-ridden atheist&quot; as Affigne 
        warned. The speakers stories themselves however were indirectly one way 
        of addressing the problem. Each speaker had chosen a small part of the 
        problem, had become involved and did what they could to turn environmental 
        racism around. However, Wangari Maathai provided the sage advice that 
        everyone has to care about these issues if change is to occur. The panelists 
        urged students to educate themselves about environmental injustice issues 
        and to make a difference. </p>
