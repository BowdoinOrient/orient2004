      </p>
      <p align="left">The search for a successor to Kent Chabotar's position of 
        treasurer at Bowdoin College is proceeding smoothly.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar decided that five months into the College's new 
        presidency was a good time for him to leave. Chabotar, hired in former 
        President Robert Edward's second year, announced in October that he was 
        stepping down from the position he has held for almost 11 years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Under the direction of President Barry Mills, the search 
        committee, which is composed of Mills; mathematics professor Rosemary 
        Roberts, head of the Budget and Financial Priorities Committee; economics 
        professor Michael Jones, former head of the committee; student representative 
        Melanie Keene '03; Dean of Academic Affairs Craig McEwen; support staff 
        representative Sharon King; Director of Events and Summer Programs Del 
        Wilson; and College Secretary Dick Mersereau, worked to define the scope 
        of the treasurer position, including responsibilities and key relationships. 
        In addition, they came up with a list of traits desirable in an applicant. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College contracted with high profile professional headhunting 
        firm Spencer Stuart in order to find applicants for the position and place 
        advertisements in college trade journals. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Once the job description was completed, Spencer Stuart began 
        its search for potential applicants. President Mills described this process 
        as &quot;essentially an exercise in networking on a large scale.&quot; 
        Armed with a description of the College and the position, Spencer Stuart 
        began to call contacts in the finance world. Some indicated an interest 
        in the position, while others pointed the group toward other candidates. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Those interested submitted resumes and biographical information, 
        which Spencer Stuart used to narrow down the field. This winter, Spencer 
        Stuart submitted to the College approximately 50 applicant profiles to 
        the College. These profiles consisted mainly of chief financial officers 
        at other schools and non-profit firms. Of those, three have emerged as 
        frontrunners and have been on campus to meet with school officials, though 
        the school's options remain open and another applicant may eventually 
        be hired. </p>
      <p align="left">Secretary of the College Dick Mersereau noted that the identity 
        of these individuals is being closely guarded. He added that open searches 
        are very rare. &quot;These candidates are very happy in their current 
        jobs and we've found that a secret search is a better search.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mersereau indicated that the search is proceeding very well 
        and that the committee is encouraged by the quality of the pool. Mills 
        added, &quot;I am pleasantly surprised by the amount of interest in the 
        position.&quot; The quality and reputation of Bowdoin makes the school 
        a very good place to work, Mersereau noted. The fact that the school is 
        now on solid financial footing, after running deficits in the years before 
        Chabotar's arrival, also works to make the position appealing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">President Mills said he hopes to select a new treasurer 
        by late March, though the selection will have to be approved by a vote 
        of the board of trustees. He also expressed confidence that Bowdoin's 
        replacement for Chabotar will be of great quality.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for Chabotar, he will complete his duties at Bowdoin 
        this June. </p>
      <p align="left">However, his commitment to teaching will continue this summer. 
        In June and July, he will teach in four programs sponsored by the Harvard 
        Institutes for Higher Education. Then come mid-summer, he will also work 
        with the Getty Leadership Institute for Museum Management at UC Berkley. 
        In addition, he will also finish writing a book on strategic finance and 
        account management, which he is coauthoring with Vice President for Investment 
        Paula Volant. As for his plans beyond this summer, Chabotar said, &quot;Who 
        knows.&quot;</p>
