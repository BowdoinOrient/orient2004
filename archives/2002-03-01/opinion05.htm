      <p align="left"><font size="5">Hyperbole and speech</font><br>
        <font size="2">SARAH RAMEY</font></p>
      <p align="left"> This article is about hyperbole. Overstatement. Exaggeration. 
        Etc. We use it, a lot. In this paragraph, I am not using it. Why? To prove 
        a point. What point? Well, funny you ask. It is hard to say. Why hard 
        to say? Well&#133;it's because&#133;I...well...<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">OK, the reason is &quot;simply&quot; this: I am completely 
        and totally incapable of constructing any kind of sentence without adding 
        flourishes and overstatements. This is in fact a characteristic of our 
        entire generation. We do not seem able to express ourselves in any small 
        way without expressing ourselves in a big huge enormous way, which ultimately 
        seems to suggest that we are terrified of how boring we might turn out 
        to be, were we to express ourselves in humble, simple, normal terms. And 
        this is really too bad.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Let me preface the rest of this by saying that I am well 
        aware that I am the prototypical example/victim of hyperbolic speech. 
        Every sentence (yes, every single last one of them) out of my mouth will 
        be just one more example of the phenomenon I am attempting to describe. 
        So please save your accusations of hypocrisy for all the other moments 
        in my life when I actually deserve them. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Illustrations of this observation:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I had to get up at the ass-crack of dawn.&quot;<br>
        Did you? Did you really? At 6:30 a.m., did the dawn's ass crack open and 
        from this fissure you sleepily emerged? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;That class made me want to vomit on myself.&quot;<br>
        Can you even imagine if you disliked political theory so much that you 
        would be sitting there in class and&#133;&quot;Wow, I really disagree 
        with everyone here. Can't anyone see that if we were only to maneuver 
        our defense budget in such a way that&#133; oh wait&#133; oh man... oh 
        NO! BLEEEEHHHHH!!&quot;<br>
        &quot;Oh my God, I ate so much I'm going to explode.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Explode? Have we just lost touch with what our words actually 
        mean? To explode in the dining hall is perhaps a more dramatic action 
        than we are imagining when we make such offhand remarks. I assure you 
        that when I say this at dinner, as I often do, I am not imagining myself 
        bursting into a fiery ball of flame next to the sundae bar. (Ha-if I did, 
        do you think the lights in Thorne would go into party mode to add to the 
        effect? That would be neat.)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So you all know, there are a good 11 or 12 people on this 
        campus, each of whom I consider and advertise as the Best Person I Have 
        Ever Met. And conversely, a typical Sarah Ramey comment:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Guys&#133;I'd really have to say that Ronda Phelpsberger 
        is definitively the worst person at Bowdoin College.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I though Brad Von Schneidel was definitively the worst 
        person you knew.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Oh yeah, he sucks&#133; huh&#133;.whoooaaa, if John Von Schneidel 
        and Ronda Phelpsberger had kids, a) they would probably name them something 
        equally as nauseating such as Sandy or Chet, b) they could hyphenate their 
        last name and make it &quot;Phelpsberger-Von Schneidel&quot; in one moment 
        of glorious hilarity and c) Sandy and Chet would be the two most excruciating 
        people with whom humanity, in all its history, has ever been burdened. 
        And that includes Carrot Top, Flanders, and G. Dubya.&quot; (Sorry, Todd. 
        But dude, you've got worse things coming to you in the wake of this week's 
        Patriotism. Good luck with that.) <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But anyway, why this need for total exaggeration to the 
        point of absurdity? Is it just because we don't have anything truly alarming 
        in our own lives? We create an abstract, fantastical threat to make us 
        feel as if we are pulling ourselves up by our own bootstraps and really 
        toughing something out? <br>
        &quot;Sarah, are you sick?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Oh man, you don't even know. The bubonic plague is 
        but a wee kiddie virus in comparison to the demon-creature that is currently 
        wreaking havoc on my immune system. At any minute now, I'd say it is well 
        within the realm of possibility that my face will just fall off. Fall 
        right off. I'm not kidding. Starting with my eyes. Then maybe my teeth, 
        quickly followed by my disease-ridden nose.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Or like I said before, are we just worried that we won't 
        be able to hold anyone's attention otherwise?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The apple I ate at lunch was pretty big&quot; becomes 
        &quot;Yo, I had the most ginormous apple at lunch today. You don't even 
        know.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A clever little amalgamation of words that, while cute and 
        perhaps mildly amusing, is entirely unnecessary and misrepresentative. 
        It is as if &quot;gigantic&quot; or &quot;enormous&quot; could not fully 
        capture the enormity of an apple. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And it is essential to point out that I really &quot;don't 
        even know;&quot; I cannot even begin to conceive of what it would be like 
        to know how super-gigantor-enormous that apple was.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While I know very few people who have escaped from this 
        bizarre trend's clutches, it really isn't some tragic, irreparable flaw 
        of Generation X .(Wait, are we even Gen X? I think I've asked that question 
        before and I always turn my ears off immediately after my mouth stops&#133;I 
        feel that I do that a lot&#133;&quot;Hi, nice to meet you...&quot; Di 
        doo di doo di doo 'EAR SHUT DOWN COMPLETED'&#133;anyways, what generation 
        are we? How about Generation Awesome? I mean if we don't have a name, 
        Generation Awesome gets my vote.)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, the sad truth of it all, for me, is really the personal 
        realization that no one believes or takes me seriously now. I'm the boy 
        who cried wolf. But a girl. Who cried that her history exam was so difficult 
        she was seriously considering flushing her face down the toilet for approximately 
        eight hours.</p>
