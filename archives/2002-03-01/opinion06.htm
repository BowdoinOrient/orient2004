        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Two weeks ago, performance artist Holly Hughes came to 
        campus and invited us to welcome dissent. She exhorted us not to feel 
        that the current war on terrorism inhibited critical, ironic, or sardonic 
        comments about President Bush. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not surprisingly, the campus respectfully greeted her. They 
        permitted her to articulate ad infinitum her disbelief in President Bush's 
        election, her difficulty in protesting on the steps of the Supreme Court, 
        and her shock that comedian Bill Mahr was chastised for saying that the 
        September 11 hijackers were &quot;not cowards.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This past weekend, <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> also came 
        to campus. It sold out Kresge Auditorium and hopefully raised a lot of 
        money for Sexual Assault Services of Midcoast Maine (SASMM). Although 
        it was undoubtedly for a good cause, the play precipitates controversy 
        wherever it goes. That is inevitable, since it deals so overtly with what 
        most people have been taught for years not to discuss; the most intimate 
        details of sexuality. <br>
        Holly Hughes and <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> are good examples of how 
        college campuses often differ from the outside world. Here, two artistic 
        endeavors that don't often find approval outside of the protected realm 
        of a campus are allowed to flourish. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yet a more detailed examination of these two events should 
        illustrate that a blatant hypocrisy exists not only here at Bowdoin, but 
        perhaps more so at other campuses across America. As co-editor of The 
        Patriot, Bowdoin's more conservative paper, I witness firsthand the incongruity 
        in Bowdoin's reaction to conservative and liberal dissent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Liberal dissent-whether it's from Cornel West, Holly Hughes, 
        <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>, Angela Davis-is always embraced and celebrated. 
        I know from personal experience that many who are offended by the public 
        and unimpeded displays of sexuality found in <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> 
        feel afraid to express their concern. Often those who would express those 
        beliefs are frightened that their ideas will be dismissed as old-fashioned 
        or that their personalities will be tarnished as &quot;intolerant.&quot; 
        How many Bowdoin students know that Angela Davis explicitly endorsed the 
        jailing of Soviet dissidents? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Holly Hughes asked us to fight the &quot;death of irony.&quot; 
        Yet I believe the true irony lies in the reaction of many universities-administrators 
        and students-when it comes to protecting the rights of all dissidents. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Campus editor Katherine Mangu-Ward writes in the spring 
        2002 issue, &quot;American universities supposedly count tolerance and 
        openness among their most important values, but some of the most prominent 
        censorship cases have come from students whose speech has been limited 
        by university administrators.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That edition of the magazine is littered with instances 
        where universities either outrightly censored conservative groups or made 
        it unnecessarily difficult for them to hold &quot;pro-America&quot; events. 
        Some administrators have forced students to remove flags, banners, or 
        any expression of support for America or her troops. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The culpability does not rest singularly with administrators. 
        At Columbia University, the student government voted down the charter 
        of Students United for Victory after approving the charter of the pacifist 
        People for Peace weeks earlier.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although Bowdoin's intolerance to conservative dissent is 
        refreshingly tepid compared to other schools, our record is not impeccable. 
        Last spring, The Patriot received word that certain student groups and 
        professors would not give David Horowitz's advertisement against slave 
        reparations a respectful hearing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The reaction to the February edition of <i>The Patriot</i> 
        should also force us to examine our tolerance of diverse opinion. After 
        writing a clearly tongue-in-cheek article that listed ten good reasons 
        why women should vote for Republicans, my colleague Katie Horsman has 
        been inundated with vitriolic, sometimes bordering on hateful, responses. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The language in some contains phrases I would never repeat, 
        let alone print in a newspaper article. Some students, apparently lacking 
        the courage Ms. Horsman showed in attaching her name to her statement, 
        have taken to the childish task of anonymously plastering quotations from 
        Ms. Horsman's article on walls, identifying themselves only as the &quot;Bowdoin 
        Society for the Elimination of Idiocy.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I'm glad to see we are so tolerant of differing points of 
        view at our diverse college. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Near the end of a &quot;pro-America&quot; rally at Amherst 
        College last October, a small group of radical students disrupted the 
        event and burned a flag in protest then dispersed before they could be 
        identified. Following the bizarre event, Amherst sophomore Theodore Hertzberg 
        wittily uttered, &quot;Amherst is 25 square miles surrounded by reality.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The same could be said for Bowdoin or most other liberal 
        arts schools. In Mr. Hertzberg's &quot;reality,&quot; those who fight 
        for the flag are praised while those who drape their naked bodies in it 
        are ostracized. Neither the town nor the gown is right. On campuses, and 
        in America, all forms of dissent should be respected.</p>
