        <font size="2">GILMAN BARNDOLLAR</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER </font></p>
      <p align="left"> I was hoping to use this space to write Dan Duquette's 
        Red Sox obituary. There are, after all, so many good memories from the 
        Duquette Era: letting Mo Vaughn and Roger Clemens walk and getting nothing 
        in return, spending over $30 million on Carl Everett, firing former American 
        League Manager of the Year Jimy Williams and watching the Sox go in the 
        tank last season. Unfortunately, it looks as if the new owners are going 
        to let Duquette hang around for a few more days while they find a replacement.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The team Duquette built is now well into spring training 
        and had its first spring game with the Twins yesterday. As the trend has 
        been under Duquette, the 2002 Sox are made up of a few true stars, many 
        average and often overpaid veterans, and a starting rotation with a lot 
        of question marks. Out of this collection Manager Joe Kerrigan is supposed 
        to assemble a team to challenge the American League Champion Yankees.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Let's start with the stars. Pedro Martinez, when healthy, 
        is unquestionably the best pitcher in baseball. The problem is, like a 
        lot of small pitchers, his durability is always a concern. Pedro basically 
        played half a season last summer, and his absence was probably the main 
        reason Boston's pitching staff fell apart towards the end. But Pedro's 
        put on fifteen pounds in the offseason and hopefully he can stay healthy 
        this year. Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and catcher Jason Varitek are also 
        coming off injuries, Nomar to his wrist, Varitek to his elbow. If they 
        can regain their past form, the Red Sox will be immeasurably better, both 
        at the plate and in the field. Manny Ramirez is healthy, but it remains 
        to be seen whether the star lef-tfielder will play like the MVP candidate 
        of the first half of last season or the mediocre hitter of the second 
        half.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">New center-fielder Johnny Damon highlights an outfield that 
        could be one of the best in the majors, with Manny and right-fielder Trot 
        Nixon. Ricky Henderson should back up Manny, and I look forward to watching 
        the future Hall of Famer steal bases and talk about himself in the third 
        person. </p>
      <p align="left">Most of the infield returns from last season. Hopefully 
        the team is planning on a replacement for the slow bat and even slower 
        feet of Jose Offerman, another great Duquette signing. Boston fans seem 
        to be salivating about 6-7 Tony Clark, a switch-hitting first baseman/DH. 
        Maybe they're forgetting that Clark makes $7 million a season, is injury-prone, 
        and is only in Boston because he was released outright by the Detroit 
        Tigers- one of the worst teams in the American League.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The pitching staff is again full of aging veterans and unproven 
        kids. It may not be as bad as last year, but there's no one besides Pedro 
        that can really be counted upon. Newcomers John Burkett and Dustin Hermanson 
        should be the third and fourth starters, but Burkett is 37 and Hermanson 
        was benched by the Cardinals during the playoffs last year. Derek Lowe 
        may make a smooth transition from the bullpen to the starting rotation, 
        or he may give us a less-frequent version of last year's Fenway meltdowns. 
        The bullpen may be more solid this year, with Tim Wakefield, Rolando Arrojo, 
        closer Ugueth Urbina, and one of the greatest obese athletes in history, 
        Rich Garces. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most of this article may sound pretty negative, but I'm 
        just trying to be realistic about the Red Sox's chances. If everyone stays 
        healthy and Kerrigan continues to work magic with the pitchers given to 
        him, the Sox may contend for the wild card and maybe even the AL East. 
        The biggest upside for Boston this year is that the clubhouse atmosphere 
        should be vastly improved. This was a team that couldn't even agree to 
        collectively donate a day's salary to the victims of September 11, because 
        they were too busy arguing amongst themselves and with management. </p>
      <p align="left">The chief malcontents, Carl Everett, Mike Lansing, and Dante 
        Bichette, are all gone, and hopefully Dan Duquette will soon follow them 
        out the door. As a listener to Boston's WEEI sports radio station put 
        it, &quot;If Carl Everett is a cancer in the clubhouse, then Dan Duquette 
        is Phillip Morris.&quot; With a new manager finally holding players accountable 
        for their conduct, maybe some kind of team chemistry will return to the 
        Red Sox. The New England Patriots proved to us this year that great team 
        chemistry can more than compensate for average talent. Hopefully we'll 
        see the same lesson demonstrated at Fenway Park this summer.</p>
