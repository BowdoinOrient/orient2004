      <p>Since his self-titled solo effort in 1994, blues guitarist Keb' Mo' has 
        become one of the blues world's brightest stars. He is a two-time Grammy 
        award winner and has been nominated for two more for his work in 2001. 
        His thick, bluesy album, <i>The Door</i> has been nominated as the year's 
        Best Contemporary Blues Album, while his slightly less orthodox effort 
        of the year, <i>Big Wide Grin</i>, has been nominated as the year's Best 
        Musical Album for Children. </p>
      <p>In an age where modern blues has become increasingly typecast by several 
        of its most socially acceptable members, Keb' Mo' is unique in his devotion 
        to traditional blues chord structures and sounds. At the same time, Mo' 
        has grown more diversified as his music progresses, unabashedly challenging 
        his limits as a solo bluesman. <i>Big Wide Grin</i> is an eclectic mix 
        of folk, blues, and world music influences that includes songs such as 
        Joni Mitchell's &quot;Big Yellow Taxi,&quot; and &quot;America the Beautiful.&quot; 
        At times, he becomes a folk troubadour similar to John McCutcheon, at 
        others, he resembles children's artist Raffi. </p>
      <p>Conversely, <i>The Door</i> evokes memories of Robert Johnson, John Lee 
        Hooker, and other prominent blues legends. It is thick, deep, and sure 
        of its roots; intensely bluesy moments are offset by backwoods country/bluegrass 
        banjo, tight, funky bass lines, and gospel choruses On both albums, Mo' 
        provides thoughtful, emotional lyrics by way of his powerfully thick voice. 
        He is alternately haunting and comical, unifying and independent. In the 
        blues tradition, he takes strength from emotions, both painful and joyful. 
        <br>
        What is more remarkable in this age of techno remixes and digital backup 
        instruments is that Keb' Mo' has mastered several instruments. Mo' plays 
        his unassumingly stunning guitar on all the tracks, as well as his harmonica 
        whenever it appears on the album. Although <i>Big Wide Grin</i> includes 
        many songs previously recorded by other artists, this is the exception, 
        rather than the rule. Nearly all of the songs on his previous albums are 
        his own compositions, usually offset by several Robert Johnson classics. 
      </p>
      <p>Keb' Mo' offers something for every musical listener. Though he is often 
        consistently in the 12-bar blues chord progression, he can progress in 
        a moment to a diverse, almost Caribbean rhythm with thick percussion and 
        freeform chords. His voice conveys anguish, pain, hurt, loss, and regret 
        well, but also provides hope, humor, faith, strength, and confidence. 
        He sings lullabies, but makes racy promises to his woman as the night 
        goes on. In many ways, Mo' is becoming the heir apparent to the reigning 
        kings of blues, BB King and Buddy Guy. </p>
      <p>I'd strongly recommend both albums, contingent upon the musical tastes 
        of the listener. <i>The Door</i> is a blues masterpiece, a solid, creative 
        testimony to Mo's talent. <i>Big Wide Grin</i> has a thinner feel, running the 
        gamut from R&amp;B to pop/rock to world music. <i>The Door</i> is aggressive 
        and bruisingly emotional, while Grin is smooth, less cohesive, and diverse. 
        Honestly, you can't go wrong. </p>
      <p>I give <i>The Door</i> a perfect 4.0 Bears and <i>Big Wide Grin</i> 3.8 Bears. </p>
