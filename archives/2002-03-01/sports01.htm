      <div align="left">While the men's hockey team has experienced success throughout 
        the season, this week was big. After downing Amherst in the first round 
        of playoffs last weekend, head coach Terry Meagher was named NESCAC Coach 
        of the Year, and senior captain Michael Carosi received Player of the 
        Year honors. Fellow captain Brian Shuman '02 and junior Sean Starke earned 
        first and second-team honors, respectively.<br>
      </div>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'm very, very proud of all three players,&quot; Meagher 
        said. &quot;It's a very positive reflection on the program.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Carosi led the NESCAC in scoring this year, totaling 13 
        goals and 33 assists in the regular season. &quot;It's very special,&quot; 
        Meagher said. &quot;This league is deep; it's very strong, and to be named 
        player of the year in puts him in a very elite group.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Meagher, Shuman has been an important team 
        leader while anchoring the defense. &quot;I'm so proud of Brian; he really 
        typifies everything you'd love to see in an athlete,&quot; he said. &quot;His 
        leadership skills are among the best I've ever witnessed.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that the 18 goals and 14 assists totaled by 
        Starke this season demonstrate his strong position in the league. &quot;Sean 
        is developing into one of the top power forwards in a conference that 
        is very talented,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;He's going to be one of our 
        key leaders in the program.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The players weren't the only honorees on Tuesday. Meagher's 
        17-3-3 NESCAC season included his 300th career win milestone on December 
        2. As usual, he was modest about the Coach of the Year honor. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I hope people are saying that this is a group of kids 
        working hard towards a common goal,&quot; he said. &quot;It reflects on 
        the kids and the College.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">His players gave his coaching a bit more credit. &quot;His 
        ability to keep our team focused and well prepared throughout the year 
        has been crucial to our success,&quot; Shuman said. &quot;Not only do 
        his players respect him as a coach, but also as a person who best represents 
        the integrity, commitment, and excellence of Bowdoin athletics. All the 
        guys are very proud of him.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fellow honoree Carosi agreed. &quot;[It] was well earned 
        and well-deserved,&quot; he said. &quot;He played a critical role in many 
        of our closest games this year...he typifies Bowdoin hockey through his 
        knowledge and work ethic, along with his loyalty to the team and his players.<br>

      <p align="left">&quot;Coach has pushed this team day in and day out, and 
        the results reflect his determination to make every player on the team 
        excel to his greatest potential,&quot; Starke said. &quot;His efforts 
        have enabled Bowdoin hockey to reach national status as one of the best 
        teams in the country.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Before they could bask in the glow of the NESCAC awards, 
        the men had to fight through their second match with Amherst in two weeks. 
        This time around, however, the score wasn't as lopsided as the previous 
        week's 8-2 outcome, and the game dynamic was much different.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was everything I thought it would be; I thought 
        the key would be their goaltending, and their goalie did make some key 
        saves in first period,&quot; Meagher said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Bill Busch got the first Bowdoin goal on the board 
        at 4:25, but the Bears wouldn't beat Amherst goaltender Justin Jagher 
        again until the first minutes of the third frame. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, the Jeffs' Beau Kretzman found the back of the 
        net at 10:05 in the second period. &quot;They rallied, and got some energy 
        off that goaltending&quot; at that point, Meagher said. &quot;[The Jeffs] 
        play a system that we don't see very often, it's very defensive...we failed 
        to execute a couple times, and had some breakdowns in coverage.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thank goodness for Mike Healey, the sophomore netminder 
        who has mitigated some strong offensive teams this season. &quot;I still 
        think it comes down to goaltending; Mike made some great saves.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He stopped 24 shots, and the Bears came away with the 3-2 
        victory. &quot;All season long, we've found ways to win,&quot; Carosi 
        said. &quot;Last weekend was a perfect example.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The Amherst game gave our team a taste of what playoff 
        hockey is all about,&quot; Shuman said. &quot;Regular season records and 
        past games mean absolutely nothing. You're forced to play with a sense 
        of desperation and intensity or else you'll be on the outside looking 
        in.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears were ranked seventh in Monday's USCHO Division 
        III men's poll. &quot;The win has kept us in the national tournament picture, 
        and allowed us to continue to fight for the NESCAC championship-our ultimate 
        goal throughout the season,&quot; Shuman added.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that Trinity (13-5-1) will surely bring a tough 
        game tomorrow. &quot;We had a great game with them down there [on January 
        25],&quot; he said. &quot;We have to make sure we play a game that's patient; 
        almost like it's the tenth game in the season-we have to be relaxed.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It promises to be a big ice game, as the ice sheet at Middlebury 
        is larger than Bowdoin's. &quot;We're going to try to use our team quickness 
        and take advantage in our neutral zone play,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We 
        have to make sure we play a game that's patient; we almost have to approach 
        it like it's the tenth game in the season-we have to be relaxed.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If they win tomorrow at 4:00p.m., the Bears will play the 
        winner of the Colby/Middlebury semifinal in the NESCAC championship on 
        Sunday. <br>
        &quot;We're looking to step up our game against tougher opponents,&quot; 
        Carosi said. &quot;There are four teams left with pretty equal talent, 
        it should come down who wants it more.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're a tough team to beat when every player is giving 
        his 100 percent,&quot; Starke said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shuman concurred. &quot;We are a blue-collar team that wins 
        by outworking our opponents,&quot; he said. &quot;We know we're fighting 
        for a NESCAC championship, and we intend to bring the trophy home this 
        weekend.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This week ends with the words of Coach Meagher, who spoke 
        with both caution and enthusiasm, as always. &quot;This is what hockey 
        is all about,&quot; he said. &quot;We're just going over there to do our 
        best.&quot;</p>
