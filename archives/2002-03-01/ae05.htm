        set foot off the Bowdoin campus. Impossible, you say? A year ago it probably 
        would have been, but thanks to the efforts of senior Simon Gerson and 
        a devoted team of volunteers, Ladd House's dining room will be transformed 
        into a gourmet restaurant every Tuesday this semester. <br>

      <p align="left">While the restaurant, titled &quot;Your Restaurant,&quot; 
        was introduced just this January, the concept was being developed all 
        last semester. Gerson, who interned last summer at a four star French 
        restaurant in New York City, said that the idea struck him when he toured 
        the renovated Ladd House in the early fall.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I saw the commercial kitchen and realized that there 
        was a lot of potential,&quot; he said. After receiving the green light 
        to open a student-run restaurant from Residential Life, the logistics 
        had to be sorted out.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We actually lose money in the process,&quot; Gerson 
        admitted, but he noted that the purpose of the endeavor is not to maximize 
        profit. &quot;Our restaurant is funded by the Mellon foundation, board 
        transfer, and a $5 fee, in addition to the gratuities of our generous 
        patrons,&quot; he explained. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Each week, Gerson buys the groceries for the evening's meal 
        and begins preparing food at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday. &quot;It really is 
        an all day process,&quot; Gerson said, &quot;I get a break with class 
        in the afternoon, but that's it.&quot; While Gerson focuses on the culinary 
        aspects of Your Restaurant, the actual management of the restaurant is 
        in the hands of Jason Pietrafitta '02. Pietrafitta, who shies away from 
        the label of &quot;manager,&quot; prefers to think of himself as a &quot;team 
        leader&quot; and lists among his duties scheduling reservations, seating 
        guests, and managing financial assets. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As dinnertime rolls around, waiters, assistant cooks, and 
        dishwashers kick into action. They set tables, make hors d'ourves, and 
        make other such preparations to ensure that the 45-50 guests they will 
        receive for the evening have a pleasant experience. Josh Jones '04 noted 
        that &quot;it can get pretty hectic around here,&quot; but overall he 
        enjoys being a part of Your Restaurant. Jones, who specializes in preparing 
        mussels with roasted garlic, finds the positive feedback of diners to 
        be particularly rewarding. &quot;I've gotten a lot of compliments on my 
        mussels,&quot; he observed, &quot;especially from the ladies.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Waiter Patrick Woodcock '04 also extolled the virtues of 
        Your Restaurant, but humbly admitted he would not have been a part of 
        it if had he not received such excellent training from BoBo's, an upscale 
        Chinese restaurant in Bangor. &quot;Waiting here has been a great experience-I 
        see it really as more of a lifestyle and mindset than simply an <br>
        occupation,&quot; he commented.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The menu, which does not rotate, features a selection of 
        appetizers including a warm root vegetable salad with balsamic vinaigrette 
        and house cured salmon, and entrees such as maple steak au poivre, portabella 
        mushroom with red wine and thyme, and salmon with fried capers and grapefruit 
        burre blanc. Dinner also includes a choice of beverage, bread, dessert, 
        and coffee or tea. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for next year, the fate of Your Restaurant is uncertain. 
        Gerson, who plans to work at a restaurant in Colorado, hopes to pass the 
        torch on to another passionate chef: &quot;I would love it if someone 
        could continue this, but we'll see what happens.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Your Restaurant, which is open to students and faculty, 
        is open from 5:30-7:30 on Tuesdays. For reservations, please e-mail Jason 
        Pietrafitta at <a href="mailto:jpietraf@bowdoin.edu">jpietraf@bowdoin.edu</a>.</p>
