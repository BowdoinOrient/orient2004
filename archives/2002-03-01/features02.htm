        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        COLUMNIST </font></p>
      <p align="left"> The American people would never vote for a man whose first 
        name was Salmon. And Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine (Bowdoin 
        class of 1823) believed just that. Of course his basis for thinking that 
        Secretary of Treasury Salmon P. Chase would not win the Republican nomination 
        for president in 1864 was rooted more on Chase's policies and popularity. 
        While not yet a firm supporter of Abraham Lincoln, by the end of 1863 
        Fessenden was slowly coming to understand the greatness of the man in 
        the White House. </p>
      <p align="left">Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg over the summer 
        months had boosted Northern morale. That fall, the Battle of Chattanooga 
        was also fought and won by the Union armies of Ulysses Grant. In that 
        fight, one of Fessenden's sons, James, served as a staff officer to Union 
        General Joseph Hooker. The general praised the Senator's son by writing, 
        &quot;I have a chip of yours on my staff, and I am happy to inform you 
        he escaped all the perils of our late battles, though much exposed&#133;.Your 
        son is a trump.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the Senate that winter a bill was introduced that would 
        reinstate the military rank of lieutenant generaL and bestow it upon Grant. 
        While not entirely sure of Grant's capability and the necessity for giving 
        such power to one man, Fessenden voted for the bill, which in turn passed 
        and changed the course of the Civil War.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden still held the chair of the Senate Finance Committee 
        and within the next year a number of tax bills would pass to keep the 
        War running. One of the most important was the Internal Revenue Bill. 
        The bill raised taxes for manufacturers within the country but also helped 
        shield American businesses from European competition.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Controversy came before the Senate in this session when 
        the issue of equal pay for black soldiers was presented. The normal salary 
        for a Union soldier, per month, was thirteen dollars. But in the case 
        of black troops, the pay was ten dollars. Many Northerners still held 
        very strong prejudices and the administration knew that they required 
        some way to show the people that blacks were not yet being treated as 
        equals. Paying them three dollars less than white troops was one of those 
        ways.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden was all for the equal pay plan but fought off 
        the idea of making these payments retroactive. The budget was already 
        in crisis and paying black soldiers for time already served did not seem 
        to the Maine senator like a good idea. But despite Fessenden's objections 
        to this clause, in June 1864 Congress agreed to pay black and white soldiers 
        equally, beginning from January of that year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The other controversial issue in the Senate that year was 
        the expulsion of Kentucky senator Garrett Davis. That senator had voiced 
        his opinion that the citizens of the North should rise up and take over 
        the government. The fact that Davis had long fought the government's control 
        over the issue of slavery did not help matters. To his colleagues, Davis 
        was a pest and with the overwhelming Republican majority there, the idea 
        came that the Kentuckian should be expelled.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden believed that there was no reason to remove Davis. 
        To the Maine senator the Senate was a place where men came from different 
        view points to debate their ideas and when one man stood against the majority, 
        there was no right to try to get rid of him. Fessenden maintained that 
        he did not support the senator's ideas but if he could not &quot;defend 
        it [the administration] against any attacks, which the Senator from Kentucky 
        or any other Senator on this floor may choose to make, then he must have 
        the advantage of me&#133;&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden believed that Davis loved his country and hated 
        the rebellion as much as he himself did. But he also knew that in winning 
        the War, it was important that the peace that was won was worth it. The 
        freedom of speech, Fessenden believed, should not be limited in the Senate. 
        The bill to remove Senator Davis was eventually withdrawn. Elsewhere in 
        the Union, away from the work of the Senate things were moving. Thanks 
        to the elevation of Grant, the armies of the United States were preparing 
        for an offensive all over the country. The rebel armies were also moving 
        to counter Grant's advances. Tom Hyde- Bowdoin class of 1861- would be 
        in one of the main prongs of Grant's overall plan. Serving on the staff 
        of Union General John Sedgwick, Hyde would find himself in the thickest 
        fighting when he rode into the Wilderness on that day in May 1864.<br>
