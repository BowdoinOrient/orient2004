      <p align="left">Barry Dana, Chief of the Penobscot Nation, opened his Common 
        Hour lecture on February 22 by asking his children what they would want 
        him to tell the Bowdoin campus about their people. His younger son said 
        that, although some of his teachers were hard, they had a good school. 
        His daughter wanted to tell Bowdoin, &quot;We are our own tribe.&quot;<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">In fact, that is perhaps one of the most integral ideas 
        to the Penobscot culture that elder Dana conveyed in his talk. Even in 
        council proceedings, all decisions are considered in terms of how they 
        will affect the next seven generations of the tribe. Dana stressed how 
        different this consideration was from the workings of modern federal and 
        state government in the U.S., especially when dealing with regulation 
        of the water quality of the rivers upon which the tribe relies for food, 
        culture, and traditions. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While water regulations take into consideration basic water 
        quality, they currently neglect the fact that the Penobscots use the rivers 
        as a drinking water source, canoe and swim in their waters, and catch 
        the fish that live there. Paper mills upstream release toxic organic chemicals 
        such as dioxins that accumulate in the food chain and end up in the fish 
        that the Penobscot people eat. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dana and his people considered this environmental oversight 
        to be as much of a disgracing as using an Indian chief as a mascot for 
        a sports team. Perhaps even more so since poisoning of the rivers causes 
        Dana's people to suffer from higher rates of death from cancer compared 
        to populations outside the reservation. How has a small nation of about 
        500 people managed to maintain its sovereignty, and more importantly, 
        protect the environment upon which its culture is connected under the 
        pressure from the federal government? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This issue came to a head in the legal controversy in which 
        the Penobscot tribe is presently embroiled. The Maine government has tried 
        to subpoena the tribe to release documents concerning correspondence with 
        EPA about controlling the water quality of the Penobscot and other rivers 
        the tribe uses. Maine and 44 other states gained control of the permit 
        process that allows discharge of chemicals by companies that was formerly 
        regulated by the EPA. However, the EPA still remained in control of permits 
        and water quality on tribal lands.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since the Penobscot Nation considers itself an independent 
        governing entity with its own say in the water quality issues of their 
        rivers, the paper mills on the Penobscot River believed the tribe would 
        set stricter regulations on pollution discharge. The tribe opposed the 
        subpoena request because its government is independent; therefore, the 
        court's order had no bearing in their affairs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the face of being held in contempt of court, the tribe 
        agreed to remove its opposition to the National Pollution Discharge Elimination 
        System (NPDES), which the state uses to grant permits to the paper mills 
        if the government would take tribal uses such as fishing and the gathering 
        of wild plants into consideration when granting permits.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dana's lecture was the opening event for the Symposium on 
        Race, Justice, and the Environment held on Bowdoin's campus this past 
        weekend. The Penobscot's battle highlights the troubles many Native American 
        and other minority groups have faced when they have tried to address how 
        environmental degradation has affected their people. In a culture where 
        a person's identity, family, social structure, and culture all depend 
        on the health of a river, the modern methods of environmental management 
        may not be sufficient.</p>
