      <p align="left"><font size="5">Class of '02 faces uncertain job market</font><br>
        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The job market faced by the Class of 2002 may be slightly 
        different from what was anticipated before September 11 and the recession, 
        according to Career Planning Center director Anne Shields.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Recruiting efforts and hiring levels have changed, and student 
        interests appear to be shifting as well. &quot;Our students this year, 
        and students on other campuses like ours, appear to be taking a significant 
        shift toward teaching, non-profit, public interest, and government,&quot; 
        Shields said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We are seeing a greater interest in not only private 
        school teaching but alternative certification for public school teaching. 
        Bowdoin has historically produced a lot of people who teach in their first 
        few years out of school, but it seems to be growing,&quot; she added. 
        &quot;We have a significant number looking at Americore (Americorps) and 
        Teach For America.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Shields, the Career Planning Center has seen 
        an &quot;exponential leap&quot; in government sector interest this year 
        as well. &quot;We were starting to see the shift back to public service 
        work anyway, but I think September 11 may have given that a nudge,&quot; 
        she said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Part of that is who we're bringing in as candidates 
        from high schools-due to curricular changes in schools&#133;I think it's 
        a natural pendulum shift that got accentuated.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Roughly a third of government employees will reach retirement 
        age by 2005, a figure that is receiving some press attention and driving 
        government recruitment. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shields indicated that, while some trends are easily observable, 
        it is difficult to isolate their causes. &quot;There's a lot of things 
        happening concurrently, and it's hard to know how much of it clearly points 
        to the economy, for example.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, data on a national scale may provide a skewed 
        view of the job market for graduating seniors. &quot;They're accurate 
        for what they measure, but they're not easily [transferable] to Bowdoin,&quot; 
        Shields said. &quot;Unfortunately, there are no national numbers that 
        measure for liberal arts colleges.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While it doesn't appear that the graduate school/employment 
        mix will be vastly different this year, there may be some change. &quot;I 
        haven't seen a marked increase in Class of 2002 students saying 'I want 
        to go to school next year,'&quot; Shields said. &quot;Most people come 
        in and say, &quot;I figure I'll be going to grad school or professional 
        school at some point, in a few years.&quot;<br>
        However, a slightly lower number of students are opting for further education 
        immediately after graduation, a shift that a lot of schools are seeing. 
        &quot;For a school like ours, professional education was a track that 
        many people chose to go in, and now they're delaying,&quot; Shields said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If students do wish to attend graduate school right after 
        Bowdoin, they may encounter closed doors. &quot;Business schools have, 
        for a long time, been saying 'Go and live for a while and then come see 
        us,'&quot; she said. &quot;It started off as 'Go live for a year or two,' 
        and now the typical starting age at the top business schools is 27 or 
        28. The better law and med schools have begun to move in that direction 
        as well.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another area where Career Planning is seeing changes is 
        in campus visits from companies. &quot;Toward the end of the summer and 
        then after September 11, people started to say 'We have no idea what our 
        hiring needs are going to be, the profits were not what we expected for 
        this quarter, and we're not hiring,'&quot; Shields said. &quot;In April 
        and May, a lot of the large organizations, particularly the consulting 
        firms, were still stalling in appointing people to positions.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The picture has improved since the initial skittishness 
        of the fall, however. &quot;Since the start of this semester, some of 
        these firms have called us and said, 'OK, we're feeling a little more 
        confident, let's talk about either coming to campus or doing some resume 
        referrals,' etc.,&quot; said Shields.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Career Planning Center's capability to track student 
        career interests has increased since the introduction of the EBear database 
        system last year. &quot;Before this, our office didn't have a sort of 
        registration process; we didn't know who was interested in what,&quot; 
        Shields said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The system allows career-planning counselors to see what 
        trends do and do not exist. &quot;[For instance,] there is the impression 
        that more students are interested in finance and Wall Street than actually 
        are, and that's probably true at most institutions of our type,&quot; 
        Shields said. &quot;We found last year that students were expressing much 
        broader interests.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Obviously, differences exist between liberal arts degrees 
        and the more specialized degrees students earn from larger universities. 
        Shields indicated that these differences have important implications in 
        today's careers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;One of the challenges that Bowdoin students will face 
        in this market is that employers are going to want immediately usable 
        technical skills,&quot; she said. &quot;We're starting to tell students 
        that they're going to have to be responsible themselves for getting these 
        skills. &quot;One of the ways that students are starting to get these 
        skills is through the service learning classes on campus,&quot; she said. 
        &quot;They're very similar to internships with their hands-on approach.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shields said that, in her opinion, liberal arts majors who 
        take some extra steps might even be at an advantage over others in the 
        job market. &quot;Liberal arts majors tend to progress more rapidly once 
        they've decided what it is they want to do, because it's the general skills 
        that move people into leadership and management positions,&quot; she said. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;If you have a path that you might want to follow, 
        get the skills that will allow you to have doors propped open for you 
        later on.&quot;<br>
