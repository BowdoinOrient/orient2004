      <p align="left"><font size="5">Tocqueville and wanting to do it all</font><br>
        <font size="2">INA HOXHA</font></p>
      <p align="left"> It's obvious that American society has changed since Alexis 
        de Tocqueville wrote Democracy in America in 1835. Since Tocqueville is 
        one of my favorite authors of political theory, I would like to continue 
        to use him as a basis for evaluating modern American society and politics 
        and to see how far we have moved-for better or for worse-from that time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The continuous desire for equality in America seems to pervade 
        all the aspects of life, not only politics. In chapter 13 of volume 2, 
        Tocqueville insightfully observes that Americans aspire to material prosperity 
        with a feverish anxiety, making them restless in their desire to enjoy 
        as many pleasures as possible in a limited time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A result of this insatiable drive for comfort is that Americans 
        are generally incapable of sustaining enduring efforts toward one goal 
        because they are so accustomed to instant gratification. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Equality, he points out, is another cause of this restlessness. 
        Equality can never be complete, because inequalities of talent and intelligence 
        always exist. Yet the more equal conditions become, the more noticeable 
        and irritating the slightest inequalities become, and the more insatiable 
        the longing for equality becomes as well. This insatiable longing is the 
        cause of general anxiousness and uneasiness. In trying to paraphrase Tocqueville, 
        I realized how many things he says in one small chapter. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tocqueville's theory hit home for me when a good friend 
        told me that I always put work before my friends, and that it doesn't 
        make her feel very special. I responded that I had my priorities straight 
        and that there wasn't anything wrong with that. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After some thought, I realized that Americans have a very 
        interesting notion that somehow they can divide everything, even time, 
        into equal proportions. My question to myself-and to you-is whether or 
        not it is possible (or should be) to categorize time this way. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A common expression exemplifying this notion is, &quot;Work 
        hard, play hard.&quot; This balancing act of trying to do everything-academic 
        work, employment, clubs, sports, friends-seems to tie in with Tocqueville's 
        observation of the feverish anxiety of Americans to do everything in a 
        limited time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lost in such fever are certain depths of experience and 
        a certain virtue of knowledge. Despite good intentions, activities become 
        watered down; every experience becomes an additional component for a resume 
        in the continuous competition of the race for equality. Material goods 
        become the bar of equality against which one is measured. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The poignant implication of this equality race is that the 
        richer one gets, the richer he or she wants to be-a vicious circle of 
        incomplete equality. <br>
        I am not saying that one should throw away all material goods and live 
        in the street. I am merely observing a cultural notion that seems to drive 
        many to nervous breakdowns.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Moreover, the advice of another friend of mine, a senior, 
        was to avoid being a &quot;syllabus slut&quot; if I ever wanted to have 
        fun. If I want to do well in school, and have a good time, something had 
        to give. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Here, a successful student is measured not by knowledge 
        gained, but by grades received. This way, one can party to death on the 
        weekends, learn what is necessary to get good marks, and participate in 
        all the clubs possible. At the expense of sounding harsh, that life seems 
        pretty mediocre to me.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This incessant desire to be equal has not necessary made 
        us equal, but it has made us uniform. Those with their priorities straight, 
        abiding by the hierarchy of interests, are marginalized-if they keep up 
        with the balancing act of doing everything yet give utmost priority to 
        academics, they are often ridiculed or criticized. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While we should love democracy, we shouldn't apply it to 
        every aspect of our lives. Let us not be so anxious to give equal proportions 
        of time to every activity. Sometimes, it's good to allow oneself sole 
        focus upon an important goal, and to let everything else come secondarily. 
        Maybe we'd also be more peaceful that way, instead of carrying that anxious 
        attitude around all the time. After all, life isn't going anywhere.</p>
