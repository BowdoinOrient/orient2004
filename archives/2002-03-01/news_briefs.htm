      <p align="left"><b>Harvard to change AP score policy</b><br>
        Harvard University announced this week that only students with a score 
        of five on high school Advanced Placement tests would receive academic 
        credits.</p>
      <p align="left">Many schools, including Bowdoin, offer placement for scores 
        of four or three, often on a departmental basis.</p>
      <p align="left">This new policy was approved when findings concluded that 
        lesser scores had not prepared many students for upper-level courses.</p>
      <p align="left">This fall's incoming class will receive exemption from the 
        new policy, as it is slated to begin with the class of 2007.</p>
      <p><b>Maine Indians consider opening casino</b><br>
        Maine's Passamaquoddy and Penobscot tribes have begun discussions regarding 
        the opening of a casino in southern Maine.</p>
      <p>Several sites are under consideration, though Democratic Representative 
        Stephen Estes says the tribes have approached him regarding Kittery, which 
        he represents.</p>
      <p>A casino would require the approval from the state legislature and the 
        governor. A Passamaquoddy casino proposition was refused in 1994.</p>
      <p><b>Teen drinking report provides questionable numbers</b><br>
        News sources nationwide covered a report this week which estimated that 
        25 percent of America's alcohol was consumed by minors. The study was 
        released by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia 
        University.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Center's figures were based on statistical data collected by the 
        government that found that 5 million high school students admitted to 
        binge drinking at least once a month. The study defined binge drinking 
        as having five or more drinks in one sitting.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Government officials responded to the Center's report by stating that 
        by their calculations, 11.4 percent of all alcohol is consumed by minors. 
        They did not dispute the figure of five million binge drinking high schoolers.</p>
      <p><b>Pakistan to turn over prisoner</b><br>
        Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has agreed to American requests to 
        turn over Ahmed Omar Sheikh, the prime suspect in the murder of Wall Street 
        Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Musharraf spoke with American ambassador to Pakistan,Wendy J. Chamberlin, 
        making it clear that American requests for Ahmed Omar Sheikh would be 
        met as soon as Pakistan completes its own criminal investigation. Musharraf 
        gave no indication of how long it would take to conclude their investigation.</p>
      <p><b>Former Enron chief exec takes the stand</b><br>
        Jeffrey K. Skilling took the stand Tuesday before a Senate panel, contending 
        that his statements to Congress were truthful, and maintaining his innocence 
        in any improper financial dealings that might have lead to the bankruptcy 
        of Enron.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Skilling, a former Enron chief executive, cut off interrogating Senators 
        and criticized their investigation, while denying having played any role 
        in the financial collapse of the Houston power company.</p>
      <p><b>Future of Afghan detainees remains uncertain</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld addressed the uncertain future of 
        several hundred Afghan prisoners who are currently detained in Guantanamo 
        Bay, Cuba. The U.S. naval base there is currently holding 300 men who 
        have been picked up in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. <br>
        Rumsfeld said that the men may be sent back home or detained with no immediate 
        plans for release. Guidelines for military tribunals are still being drafted. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The detainees have not been formally charged with any crimes, and according 
        to President Bush, will not receive prisoner-of-war status.</p>
