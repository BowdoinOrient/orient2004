        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG<br>
        COLUMNIST </font></p>
      <p align="left">Ron's hopes of selling the stuff he'd brought with him from 
        the West Coast literally went up in smoke. That of innumerable joints 
        smoked by us and our friends, squatting on the bare floor like a bunch 
        of Indians passing the peace pipe. </p>
      <p align="left">Among these as related last week was the organiser of illicit 
        flights to Havana via East Berlin; a prominent member of the Fair Play 
        for Cuba Committee, surely on the lists of both the FBI and CIA. </p>
      <p align="left">Having gone to school in East Berlin he of course was able 
        to talk with me - or whisper, in case the place was bugged - in fluent 
        German. </p>
      <p align="left">One day he suggested we all go to St. John the Divine, the 
        cavernous und unfinished modern Cathedral on the upper Westside, to hear 
        Martin Luther King. The Civil Rights leader's speech , expected to be 
        critical of the Vietnam War, was billed as heralding a possible bid for 
        the White House. <br>
        But when hearing a young black from the Deep South calling King an 'Uncle 
        Tom' I realised our liberal idol would have a long way to go before getting 
        to that particular mountain top.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Aptly named Willy Blackman, the 19-year-old had a number 
        of cronies, none as lithe and black as he, but hefty types of various 
        shades and ages clearly after more than just the occasional joint. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One afternoon while I was on my own in the 8th Street pad 
        two of them turned up quite unexpectedly, politely asking me for a 'loan', 
        yet in a manner implying they wouldn't take No for an answer. Presumably 
        they needed the money for harder stuff than what was on offer at Ron's. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I had no cash on me I truthfully told them. So they suggested 
        we take a walk to my bank near Tomkins Square, center of the Lower East 
        Side, as Washington Square is of the Village. Here I cashed a cheque and 
        gave them the money. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Whether Willy was on heroin too I don't know, but he was 
        certainly into all sorts of other things besides pot, for example amphetamines, 
        which he called 'speed'.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One evening, having got thoroughly stoned first, he took 
        me uptown to a party of white friends, Civil Rights activists like himself, 
        but affluent middle-class kids. They of course lionised someone who just 
        about epitomised the new adage 'black is beautiful', and Willy lapped 
        it up. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the height of the party he produced some 'speed', to 
        'top up' our high, insisting I should join him in taking it. I did, but 
        with dire results. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On our way back to 8th Street by cab Willy to my embarrassment 
        started talking in exaggerated southern accent, and yelling Watermelon! 
        every time he caught sight of a grocer's fruit display on the sidewalk. 
        But it was when I noticed a revolver on the seat beside the driver that 
        mild embarrassment turned into acute paranoia. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Panicked into thinking the driver might use it I assured 
        him that my black friend was 'quite harmless'. However this made matters 
        only worse, with an embarrassed Willy wildly apologising for his white 
        friend having a 'bad trip'. <br>
        Which was to go from bad to worse, and as the night wore on to turn into 
        a nightmare. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back at the pad Ron and the guys I had given money were 
        getting quietly stoned, and passing their joints to us. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But it wasn't until one of the latter casually mentioned 
        he worked in the morgue at Bellevue Hospital that paranoia turned into 
        panic. <br>
        Suddenly in my fevered imagination it all fell into place: they were heroin 
        addicts after my Bolex film camera, which they meant to take from me and 
        sell to finance their habit. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My fears were exacerbated by the memory of having been mugged 
        a few nights earlier, right outside the house, by three black youths. 
        Shoving me into the dark hallway they took my wallet, containing forty 
        dollars, and threatened to take my high-heeled boots, bought in London's 
        Carnaby Street. Shall we kill him, one of them cheerily asked.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">No doubt that was what Willy's friends were planning to 
        do I was convinced, before taking my Bolex. So I must stay awake. When 
        I saw Ron dropping off I threw a glass of water over his face. You're 
        having a bad trip he gently said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When it began getting light outside, and they'd all dozed 
        off, I made my decision. Grabbing the Bolex and my Greek shepherd cloak 
        I fled. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There happened to be a police car parked on the corner. 
        Greatly reassured, I started aimlessly walking south along the river, 
        then cross-town to the West Side, heading north after a while. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After an hour or so, about 6 a.m., I found myself on West 
        23rd Street walking past the entrance of a hotel called The Chelsea. Not 
        aware this was the Manhattan abode of famous literati and artists I blithely 
        marched in. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A bleary-eyed night clerk looked up in astonishment. Had 
        I been out filming he politely inquired, with clipped British accent. 
        (He'd been secretary to the poet Robert Graves he later told me). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yes, I said, almost convinced myself that I had. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As I came down again later that day, after a hot bath and 
        a good sleep, I found myself standing in the elevator next to a big man 
        with craggy features vaguely familiar to me from photos: the playwright 
        Arthur Miller. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fame at last? No. But at least, safe and sound, among the 
        famous.</p>
