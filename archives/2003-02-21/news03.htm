      <p align="left">In the case of a biological, chemical or nuclear attack 
        is Bowdoin College and the Brunswick community equipped to effectively 
        deal with such a disaster? </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Yes,&quot; Chief Gary Howard says unequivocally of the Brunswick 
        Fire Department who is also the Town Emergency Management Director, &quot;we 
        have more equipment than we can deal with.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Such statements are often an abnormality around the country where many 
        cities and towns have complained to the federal government and, specifically, 
        the Department of Homeland Security that they do not have sufficient supplies 
        and training needed to protect their citizens from exposure to biological 
        or chemical agents. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Town of Brunswick, however, has received $70,000 worth of equipment 
        in the fall of 2002 alone. The equipment ranges from &quot;M9 paper&quot;, 
        which tests for biological agents to anthrax kits and decemeters, which 
        measure radiation dosage. Outside the Fire Department building there is 
        a Hazardous Waste Materials (HAZMAT) Unit trailer tightly filled with 
        supplies such as decontamination tents, encapsulated suits and monitors 
        for measuring the levels of agents in a potential victim. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lieutenant Robert Robitaille says that much of the reason the Brunswick 
        Fire Department is so well prepared to deal with biological and chemical 
        agents is that their HAZMAT Unit has been in full operation for over 11 
        years. Four of their firemen are classified as &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction 
        (WMD)-certified technicians&quot; even before the events of September 
        11, 2001 ensued. &quot;We are ahead of the game. We are one of seven original 
        HAZMAT teams in the state.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Brunswick HAZMAT Unit covers a region that extends far from just the 
        town's boundaries. The span of coverage includes four of the state's counties: 
        Sagadohoc, Lincoln, Androscoggin and the northern part of Cumberland counties. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite their extensive coverage, training and surplus of equipment, Brunswick 
        Fire has had little experience with actual cases where the HAZMAT Unit 
        was needed. &quot;Only four times over the course of eleven years has 
        it been used,&quot; pointed out Chief Howard.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After 9/11, though, the Department received some calls regarding possible 
        anthrax outbreaks, which eventually turned out to be negative reports. 
        Yet if the tests of the white powder had come out positive, &quot;it would 
        have been escalated to the HAZMAT Unit,&quot; Chief Howard said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the case of an emergency involving biological or chemical agents, the 
        Brunswick HAZMAT Team estimates it would take them approximately thirty 
        minutes to transport the necessary equipment and time for its set-up within 
        a 10-mile radius of the firehouse. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The HAZMAT Team could draw upon the Bowdoin campus for assistance in the 
        case of such an emergency. Bowdoin would be coordinated with first local, 
        then county and then state authorities, according to Bruce Boucher, Director 
        of Security. &quot;We have resources they can draw upon.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Those resources are specifically the facilities that a college campus 
        such as Bowdoin is able to offer the community in times of an emergency. 
        &quot;Bowdoin is one of the area's top resources if a large disaster were 
        to occur because the campus has independent food and its own power plant,&quot; 
        Chief Howard emphasized. He points out that on September 11, 2001, when 
        many international and domestic flights were being rerouted, there was 
        a plan to house many of the airline passengers in Farley Field House because 
        of its large size and close proximity to those independent food and power 
        resources on the campus. The plan never did come to be, but it was a closely 
        examined possibility in which Bowdoin's facilities could have played an 
        important role on September 11. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin is in the stages of reviewing its emergency plans. Currently, 
        the Security Department has five members who have been through &quot;Weapons 
        of Mass Destruction (WMD) Responder Training.&quot; However, the administration 
        wants to improve the coordination of such emergency plans through its 
        Emergency Management Team, which is composed of administration officials 
        such as President Barry Mills and sixteen other department heads. An emergency 
        simulation exercise was scheduled to take place this Tuesday (but was 
        cancelled due to weather) through Maine Emergency Management Training, 
        which Bruce Boucher says would have focused on improving sound decision-making 
        processes that are crucial in the event of emergency. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As for the Brunswick Fire Department's readiness in the case of an attack, 
        Chief Howard seems quite content with the department's equipment, except 
        he is, &quot;hoping for money for a motorized vehicle specifically for 
        the HazMat trailer.&quot; As of now, the Department has to hook it up 
        to another truck in order to transport the trailer. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lieutenant Robitaille, too, has no qualms about sharing his belief in 
        the preparedness of Brunswick's HazMat Team. &quot;We are more prepared 
        than any other team in the state.&quot;</p>
