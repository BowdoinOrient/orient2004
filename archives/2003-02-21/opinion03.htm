      <p align="left"> It's been over a year since President Bush so insightfully 
        found Iraq to be a threat worthy of military action, which is interesting 
        because the United States stopped a North Korean freighter bound for Yemen 
        carrying 15 scud missiles, found the missiles, and then proceeded to let 
        the ship continue; yet he still quarrels over mythical weapons in Iraq. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Since then, the nation has been consumed in the debate over whether or 
        not military action is warranted, but what have the Bush administration 
        and the Republican party been up to on the home front while we've all 
        been distracted by international affairs? A cute little ancillary effect 
        of all the attentions spent on whether or not to attack Iraq is that the 
        Bush administration has been able move the country further right along 
        the ideological spectrum and further away from the progress attained by 
        the Clinton Administration. Let's take a look at the ruin that has become 
        American domestic politics. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bush administration has decided that it is the role of religious charities 
        to ease the suffering of America's poor as more and more programs to aid 
        the poor, ill, disabled and elderly are cut by the Bush administration. 
        The following are just a few examples. The Bush administration has proposed 
        a federal law that if implemented would raise the rent payments required 
        of poor people who receive housing aid. It has made plans to change Medicare 
        in a way that would reduce the quality of healthcare services provided 
        for the elderly. His plan cuts funding for juvenile delinquency programs, 
        public housing assistance, and children's health insurance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the new proposed budget would total 2.2 trillion dollars, and will 
        result in huge budget deficits, it will end funding for after school programs, 
        which occupy children during the time when juvenile crime is most apt 
        to occur for 500,000 needy children. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meanwhile, the President's plans for government spending become increasingly 
        reckless. The chairman of the Federal Reserve referred to the huge budget 
        deficits that will result from the Bush tax plan as &quot;sobering.&quot; 
        The New York Times' Hal Varian said on the Congressional Budget Office's 
        conclusions concerning the Bush administration's fiscal policy, &quot;Their 
        conclusion is that current patterns of spending and revenue are just not 
        sustainable. Large future tax increases or drastic spending cuts are virtually 
        inevitable.&quot; In fact, in order to ease the passage of his irresponsible 
        tax cuts, the president's budget refers to them as being temporary. Forecasts 
        under the present system predict that the government will spend $5.4 trillion 
        more than it takes in for the next ten years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even the President's strongest base of support, house republicans, have 
        expressed concern about the president's fiscal policies. In fact they 
        are particularly wary of the Bush administration's flagship tax cut on 
        stock dividends that would cost the treasury $300 billion over the next 
        ten years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        One of the president's most repeated promises during his campaign for 
        the presidency was his promise to leave no child behind, in the arena 
        of public education. In the face of the president's educational spending, 
        educators have had to swallow that now all too familiar pill force fed 
        to them by the Bush administration-the pill that promises substantially 
        more support than is actually delivered. Educators and backers of the 
        No Child Left Behind law state that the actual levels of federal spending 
        are significantly lower than the administration agreed to spending when 
        it negotiated with congress. The president's budget raised spending in 
        the nation's lowest-income schools to 12.3 billion, but this number is 
        six billion short of what the administration promised. Also, the bill 
        covers its increase in spending in certain areas by cutting others. The 
        level of funding is not only inconsistent with the promises made by the 
        administration but also inconsistent with the high expectations that the 
        administration makes for the improvement in our nations' schools. Essentially, 
        he raises the bar while simultaneously cutting the legs out from under 
        schools. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In fact statistics show that the bush administration did raise spending 
        on poverty stricken schools early in his administration's tenure, though 
        he still did not attain the levels promised, yet every year spending on 
        schools continues to fall further behind the administration's promises. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps the most egregious example of failing domestic politics are the 
        massive gaps in state budgets. Budget shortfalls are staggering and many 
        state employees are losing their jobs. What is the relationship to the 
        Bush administration? Unfunded mandates by the federal government, including 
        many homeland security measures and education, are undermining state budgets. 
        Though they are not the only problem, adding $25 billion in new unfunded 
        mandates, on top of old ones are certainly not helping. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While the Bush administration drags the nation into war it also wreaks 
        havoc upon our nation's finances. The Bush administration's fiscal policy 
        is reckless at best. The danger lies in this statement: talk is cheap. 
        The Bush administration preaches compassionate conservatism; meanwhile 
        its policies suggest that the president probably doesn't understand the 
        meaning of the word. Either that or he's flat out lying. Though the Bush 
        administration preaches about its noble intentions his actually policy 
        reflects his domestic political impotence. </p>
