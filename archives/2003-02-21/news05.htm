        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Authorship and authority are words that are closely linked 
        - both by root word and by the implications they have in the academic 
        world. Unfortunately, the legitimacy of both women and other minority 
        groups in the power scheme has traditionally been under scrutiny. As a 
        result, establishing themselves in positions of authority remains a difficulty 
        for minority individuals and most often for women. The process can often 
        be like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. Gesa E. Kirsch, 
        the Professor of English and Research Fellow at the Center for Business 
        Ethics at Bentley College, presented some approaches to this daunting 
        task and some remedies for the situation in her lecture.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The most important part of establishing authority in the academic world 
        is taking on a voice of authority in the realm of scholarly literature. 
        However, Kirsch noted that &quot;learning to write is a complex process&quot; 
        and &quot;establishing authority [in writing] is further complicated by 
        being a woman.&quot; Those who try to gain authority must fit in with 
        preexisting notions of authority. &quot;Male voices,&quot; said Kirsch 
        &quot;have been closely associated&#133;with authority&quot; and, therefore, 
        female voices are often in danger of being blatantly overlooked and trivialized.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kirsch also noted a distinction between having authority versus being 
        perceived as having authority. In a study of successful women writers, 
        Kirsch found that the more years of experience a given individual had, 
        the more confident that woman was. For example, one female professor who 
        participated in the study commented, &quot;I think having tenure&#133;gives 
        you a certain amount of freedom.&quot; On the other hand, successful female 
        writers-no matter how long they had been in the academic world-generally 
        commented they could never take their authority for granted. Thus, female 
        academics often found themselves in the position of constantly proving 
        their authority before taking risks in terms of the actual academic material 
        with which they were working.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In order to remedy the present problems with authority and authorship, 
        Kirsch suggested that it is up to the academic institutions to create 
        space where minority voices can carry authority. &quot;It is important 
        for students to be able to think of themselves as scholars and intellectuals,&quot; 
        said Kirsch. Thus, as students, women must be allowed to begin to develop 
        voices of authority.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Some suggest that it is the argumentative and competitive nature of scholarly 
        writing that has kept women from establishing their authority. Often, 
        a scholar must first &quot;shoot down&quot; opponents in order to have 
        the authority to make their own claim. Thus, institutions should teach 
        a wider range of writing styles that caters more to the supposedly female 
        tendency towards non-confrontational interaction. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kirsch suggested, however, that the gender lines concerning methods of 
        argument are often overblown. In light of this observation, the argumentative 
        style should not be wholly abandoned. Rather, women should be taught to 
        deal with the conflict that they will inevitably confront in the world 
        of scholarly writing. &quot;We can educate women about the challenges 
        they will face,&quot; said Kirsch. &quot;It is better to teach women to 
        add new work to the scholarly body of knowledge rather than teaching them 
        to constantly challenge the current academic power structure.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kirsch's research focuses on ethics, feminism, qualitative research, composition 
        theory, and women's roles in higher education. Her publications include 
        Ethical Dilemmas in Feminist Research: The Politics of Location, Interpretation, 
        and Publication (SUNY 1999); Women Writing the Academy: Audience, Authority, 
        and Transformation (SIUP, 1994); and several other co-edited collections.</p>
