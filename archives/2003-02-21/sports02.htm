      <p align="left">While last Friday's win against the University of Southern 
        Maine ended Bowdoin's three-game losing streak, it also marked a milestone 
        for Head Coach Terry Meagher. Recording his 327th career win, Meagher 
        passed the legendary Sid Watson as Bowdoin's winningest hockey coach in 
        College history. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Add to that achievement a remarkable comeback against Salem State College 
        on Saturday, this past weekend's performance proves that the Polar Bears 
        are back on track and ready to take on the NESCAC playoff tournament.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We were in a dry spell the past week or two,&quot; said coach Meagher, 
        who was honored in a special ceremony after Friday night's 7-2 win against 
        USM. &quot;This season is five months long, and we're going to have periods 
        that don't go our way. But the last two matches were very strong-I think 
        our game against Salem State was as good a game as we have played all 
        season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin's defense performed admirably last Friday, as the visiting Huskies 
        mustered only nine shots on goal all night. Captain Sean Starke '03 led 
        the Polar Bears with two goals and helped Bowdoin improve its record to 
        13-5-2.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Hot off a win and eager for more, the Polar Bears took on Salem State 
        Saturday afternoon, a team that gave Bowdoin its first loss of the season 
        back on December 28. Bowdoin got on the board first with a goal from first-year 
        Jesse Minneman, but for most of the game it was all Salem State. The Vikings 
        rallied for four unanswered goals and took a 4-1 lead deep into the third 
        period.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, with less than ten minutes to play, Chris Pelletier '04 and Starke 
        both scored goals to make it 4-3, bringing Bowdoin within striking distance. 
        With less than three minutes to play, coach Meagher gambled by removing 
        goalie Mike Healey, and everyone in Dayton Arena held their breath during 
        the risky open net play. The game looked all but lost before senior Adam 
        Mantin finally found the net with a mere 19 seconds left on the clock, 
        securing the tie for Bowdoin and sending the crowd into an absolute uproar.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the Polar Bears could not secure the win in overtime, all in 
        all the weekend settled well for the hockey team. &quot;We're back on 
        the right track,&quot; said forward Mike O'Neill '04. &quot;We picked 
        a good time to get our act together.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Junior Goaltender Mike Healey, who made 31 saves during the weekend, was 
        equally pleased with the weekend's results. &quot;We played really well 
        overall, and I think we are in good shape for the playoffs. We have a 
        tough weekend coming up, and after that anything can happen.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Friday's win over USM clinched a home ice advantage for the Polar Bears 
        in the first round of the NECSAC playoffs, which start March 1. &quot;Anytime 
        you can get home ice in the first round, you know you are doing something 
        right,&quot; said Meagher, who is excited about his team's chances. &quot;This 
        is a special group of young people, and they represent the school in all 
        the right ways. They've earned it.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The 13-5-3 Polar Bears hit the road today to take on Amherst College tonight 
        and Hamilton College tomorrow afternoon, before returning home for playoffs 
        next weekend. GO U BEARS!</p>
