      <p align="left">It's almost time for the sailing team to break the ice and 
        get back out on the water. In two weeks, the coed team will be heading 
        out for their first regatta of the season: the &quot;Icebreaker&quot; 
        at the Coast Guard Academy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Therefore, for the next two weeks, the Orient will conduct interviews 
        of the two senior skippers on the varsity co-ed team. This week, the Orient 
        will focus on Ryan Patrick Cauley '03, who generally sails with Becca 
        Bartlett '05. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Cauley is a senior from a diverse array of places including Greenwich, 
        Connecticut; Cape May, New Jersey; and New York, New York. Cauley, who 
        is finishing up his self designed, interdisciplinary major in body kinetics, 
        is interested in a wide variety of disciplines and hopes to eventually 
        earn a Ph.D. in medicine and his masters in public health administration. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        He also plans to reserve time to teach his parrot a new language and to 
        write numerous novels, including anticdotal accounts about his days on 
        the Bowdoin College Sailing Team. According to Cauley, many of his best 
        days have been spent out on the waters of Quahog Bay near Cundy's Harbor 
        while sailing with his many crews, always trying to catch the best oscillations 
        around Pole Island-a talent for which he is famous.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Orient: How did you originally learn to sail?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Cauley: Well, back when I was about eight, my dad, a great sailing enthusiast, 
        would take my brother and me out for a sail and pretend to fall asleep. 
        I therefore had to teach myself the ways of the boat in order to get us 
        home safely. I soon fell in love with the sport and proved to my parents 
        that I was a far better sailor than swimmer and was thus enrolled full-time 
        in sailing lessons-first sailing sun-fish and later optimists. I then 
        moved from student to teacher, and have been teaching sailing for six 
        years now. </p>
      <p align="left">
        O: What are some of your favorite memories of your sailing experiences 
        throughout all the years?</p>
      <p align="left">
        C: Well, one of my most memorable experiences sailing with my dad was 
        when we were caught in a lightning storm. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But in terms of my time sailing at Bowdoin, I must say that one of my 
        most vivid memories was sailing in Florida during our spring break training 
        trip my freshman year. One day when we were sailing down there, a huge 
        gust of wind, almost hurricane force, came up. It capsized the entire 
        team, and it was the first time I had capsized all year-before that I 
        had a little record going. </p>
      <p align="left">
        O: Wow, lighting and hurricane winds! Any other crazy stories like that 
        while you've been sailing here?</p>
      <p align="left">
        C: Well, right after we came back from spring break that year, my crew, 
        Melanie Keene '03, and I went to a regatta at Boston College. The wind 
        was gusting over 30 knots and the water was ice cold because it was still 
        March. When we were going around the jibe mark during one race, we death 
        rolled and the boat turtled. That means it completely turned over upside 
        down in the water. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Melanie was stuck submerged under the water tangled in the lines until 
        I was able to right the boat. That was certainly scary, but I got the 
        boat up in time! </p>
      <p align="left">
        O: Do you have any goals for your last season?</p>
      <p align="left">
        C: Well, one of my goals is to stay away from Storrow Drive in Boston. 
        When I sail at M.I.T. on the Charles River, I sail in my favorite boats 
        called Techs. In the heavy wind, I have a tendency to sail too close to 
        the Storrow Drive side of the river. The wind always looks good over there, 
        but it is generally an illusion. The Charles is known to be the trickiest 
        place to sail in college sailing because of the quick wind shifts. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition, in my position on the team as assistant Larktician, another 
        one of my goals is to devise a new format to keep our boats, Larks, in 
        better shape. We have fairly new boats and we're trying to make them stay 
        in pristine condition for as long as possible. </p>
      <p align="left">
        O: Any last thoughts?</p>
      <p align="left">
        C: Well, everyone should know what an awesome and fun team we have. Sailing 
        is a great sport, and we welcome people to come and try it out! And, we 
        have wonderful spring breaks-we're going to Galveston, Texas this year. 
        I'll be joining Melanie on a two-man 30-hour road trip down south; it 
        should be an experience never to forget!</p>
