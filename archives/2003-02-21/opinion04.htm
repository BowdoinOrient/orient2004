      <p align="left"> It would seem to make sense. A person who is interested 
        in another person should be able to get to know them better and then decide 
        whether they want to spend more time with them and ultimately if they 
        want to get into a relationship with them or not. Sounds simple, but apparently 
        Bowdoin students think that wishing really, really hard will get their 
        crush to fall in love with them. Frankly, that's just dumb. If you want 
        a good grade, you study; if you want another beer, you get up and walk 
        to the keg, right? So why, if you want a person, would you just stand 
        there and whine about it when you could actually do something? That is 
        why this week I challenge Bowdoin to TAKE ACTION.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's absurd how many times I hear someone say, 'Why is she with 
        him?' or 'How did she get that guy?'&quot; bemoans Carrie. &quot;You get 
        someone by going after them!&quot; This is true. I cannot begin to count 
        how many relationships (or hookups, for that matter) that have occurred 
        simply because one person wanted another and did something about it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I realize this may seem like a foreign concept to some people. It is much 
        easier to talk about thinking someone is really cool or attractive. But 
        I think there would be a lot less frustration (sexual and otherwise) on 
        this campus if people actually went after whom they wanted to.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Lee is a perfect example of someone who asks a girl out when he decides 
        he likes her. He goes on more dates than anyone else I know at Bowdoin. 
        Sometimes he gets turned down, sometimes the date doesn't lead to anything, 
        but as long as he keeps trying, he's never lonely for too long.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I don't know why more people don't let their crushes know they like them. 
        News flash: people like being liked! Finding out you like them may even 
        be cause enough for a person to start liking you! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meghan had always known Aaron but never thought twice about him until 
        he asked her out-they dated happily for a few months and all because he 
        went for it. She is, to be completely shallow, a lot better looking than 
        he is and many people wondered why they were going out. &quot;Honestly,&quot; 
        Meghan says now, &quot;I hadn't thought about him in that way and there 
        were definitely other guys I was interested in at the time, but when a 
        really great guy makes a move, you can't help but be flattered. When he 
        asked me out, I figured 'Why not?' and look what happened!&quot; As hard 
        as it might be to believe, just going for someone may be all you need 
        to get him or her.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It may seem as though I am only talking about guys asking out girls. I 
        am by no means precluding a girl asking a guy out-I think it would be 
        great if it happened more often, and from what I am told, guys feel the 
        same way. </p>
      <p align="left">
        (Yes, I know in this context I am talking about heterosexual people, but 
        I can't even begin to imagine the frustration between two lesbians, neither 
        one having enough nerve to ask the other out)</p>
      <p align="left">
        Until such is the norm with straight couples, I have another proposal. 
        Although I realize I am going out on a limb here with my conservatism, 
        I would like to promote another, more immediate solution. If a girl is 
        not going to ask out a guy she likes, the least she can do is to show 
        interest. Telling all of his friends and teammates may be part of this, 
        but too often girls think that suffices. I mean she should let a guy know 
        that she likes him so that he knows he can ask her out without fear of 
        rejection, which, we all know, is really what's holding everyone back. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        That said, I know I am putting most of the onus on the male sex. But hey, 
        Valentine's Day is over, which takes some pressure off, and now there 
        is really no excuse. If a guy is happily single, he should of course not 
        ask someone out for the sake of doing it. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So, here is my challenge to the male population at Bowdoin: if there is 
        a girl you like, or a girl you think might like you (and you are not so 
        averse to the thought) then stop whining about it and take some action! 
        Obviously this takes much more courage than just drunkenly throwing yourself 
        into someone's bed, but the potential rewards are so much greater.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you've wanted her since your Pre-O or if a girl in your Government 
        class has been flirting with you consistently for a while, call her, write 
        her an email or just ask her out in person. You might be surprised. Lauren 
        testifies; &quot;If any guy asked me out, as long as did not already know 
        I hated him, I would at least go on one date with him. Why not? Who knows 
        what could happen if I got to know him a little better?&quot; FACT: EVERY 
        GIRL I ASKED ABOUT THIS AGREED THAT UNLESS THEY ALREADY KNEW THEY DID 
        NOT LIKE A CERTAIN GUY, THEY WOULD NOT TURN DOWN A DATE. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So girls, if you don't have the guts to ask someone out, let him know 
        you are interested. Guys, you have so much more to lose if you don't make 
        the move. Go for it!</p>

        I mean, let's be honest, where would Ty Cobb be if he hadn't swung at 
        all?</p>
