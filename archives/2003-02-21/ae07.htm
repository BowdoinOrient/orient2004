      <p align="left">Little did anyone know that Little Egypt is famous in Poland. 
        But then again, what underground rap group isn't? They love underground 
        hip hop in Poland. According to Little Egypt, they know all the lyrics 
        to every song, and better than that, they hate Puff Daddy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We did some freestyles on an internet radio station here in the 
        states,&quot; explained Khordz 255, one of the group's members. &quot;A 
        dj in Poland heard the broadcast and loved it so they flew us over there 
        for a couple weeks.&quot; Not only did they fly them across the Atlantic, 
        they greeted them at the station with nothing less than an entourage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I finally know what the Beatles felt like,&quot; said Taaj. &quot;We 
        did a lot of performing on Viva Polska, like their version of BET. They 
        actually took video tapes of our shows and turned it into an advertisement 
        for the show. We were sitting watching TV, you know not paying attention, 
        and then we see Braverstar up there on the screen in a rave.&quot; Bravestar 
        is one of the group's members, all of whom are talented lyricists from 
        New York City. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It's been over ten years since the members of Little Egypt came together 
        in New York. They only went international very recently. A trip to South 
        America took them to Brazil several years ago where the group had an opportunity 
        to perform at the afterschool program &quot;Casa de Hip Hop.&quot; With 
        classes on graffiti and hip hop culture, &quot;Casa de Hip Hop&quot; is 
        like a much cooler version of the &quot;Boys and Girls Club&quot; here 
        in the states. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Performing there really taught us that world wide hip hop is not 
        only a culture but a way of life.&quot; Little Egypt hopes to return to 
        Brazil again to do some charity concerts. They even plan to show up with 
        a can of food.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Performing for charity is part of the groups vibe. They enjoy performing 
        for all different types of people in all different types of places. Never 
        ones to hold themselves above their fans, the members of Little Egypt 
        always make time to meet the people who come to the show. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many students who attended last Saturday's concert had just that opportunity. 
        Members of the club Poetics got some help with their rhymes while audience 
        members got to shake a few hands and make some new friends. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We're all regular people,&quot; said Visual Poetics, the group's 
        self-described hippie. &quot;That's just what we do. There's no real star 
        power. We all tend to be pretty much in awe of each other. A lot of our 
        inspiration comes from within the group. We definitely vibe off of each 
        other.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        With a diverse array of different personalities, the members of the group 
        have a lot to share with each other. &quot;It's about the different personalities 
        in the group,&quot; said Visual Poetics. &quot;Like Bravestar and Taaj 
        are a little crazier. I'm probably the hippie. I connect with a more 'out 
        there' vibe, and Khordz is the most musical. He comes from the old school.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The members of Little Egypt came together 1989 when they began performing 
        in various venues around New York. Though they had known each other for 
        years (some of them are related) they waited until they finished college 
        to start their own record company. Since then they've branched out to 
        a number of different performance spaces with a diverse body of audience 
        members. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We can do a kids show one night and then the next night we can do 
        a smoked out club in Brooklyn. We can reach out and touch everybody there. 
        I don't know too many other hip hop groups that can do that,&quot; said 
        Visual. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The group's biggest North Eastern concert was Grassroots, a four day show 
        that takes place in upstate New York. Not only did Little Egypt bring 
        the house down, they brought hip hop to Grassroots for the first time 
        in the show's history. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It was the first time they'd had a hip hop show at Grass Roots and 
        the response was overwhelming,&quot; said Taaj. &quot;We ended up doing 
        four different shows and linking up with other bands. We're real spontaneous 
        like that.&quot; From bluegrass to reggae, the other bands they met at 
        Grassroots gave them a diverse array of musical inspiration.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Little Egypt inspired the audience at Grassroots as well. &quot;People 
        really took to us because we were the harder edge that the festival never 
        really had. At the same time we bonded with both younger and older crowds,&quot; 
        said Visual. &quot;We're hip hop so people bring us and think let them 
        appeal to the real young but at that show there's the young, the real 
        young, the old, the older, the oldest! It was a wild response. There's 
        people there your parent's age. It was younger kids and their parents. 
        When you're connecting with two different generations of a family, that's 
        kind of special.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Little Egypt doesn't find it difficult to get their name out either. With 
        the help of some creative brainstorming, they've come up with plenty of 
        ways to advertise their group. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;These cats are like the most creative cats I know,&quot; said Visual. 
        Dane Matthews, the group's manager, helps to keep them in touch with lots 
        of people, one of which is Bowdoin's own Burgie Howard. &quot;Dane handles 
        a lot of stuff like that. We do a lot of headbutting, but it's brought 
        us in touch with some great people. We love Burgie,&quot; said the group. 
        Dane also put the group in touch with their dj, DJ Big Wiz from the Almighty 
        Steelworkers crew. He joined the group just before they left for Poland 
        after they were instructed to bring a dj. In addition to getting to know 
        the group, Big Wiz was happy to take a trip to Poland, even if the food 
        was a little bit hard to take.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Fortunately, Little Egypt ate much better at Big Top. After a night of 
        performing at Bowdoin and checking out the local scene, Little Egypt was 
        happy to enjoy some sandwiches at Brunswick's best deli. Unlike the rappers, 
        the sandwiches may not be straight from New York, but they still satisfied 
        some hungry performers. Then again, Little Egypt seems to be at home wherever 
        they are, be it New York, Brunswick, Brazil, or Poland.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Connecting with all different kinds of people is something that defines 
        Little Egypt. They hope to return to Maine some time this year, doing 
        a tour of Bates, Colby, and Bowdoin. No matter where they go, they're 
        confident the crowds will be pleased. After all, they've had a good response 
        from the young and the old. &quot;In Ithaca a guy came up to us and was 
        like, 'can I buy your CD for my daughter?' There's not too many fathers 
        buying hip hop CDs for their daughters.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In case your father didn't buy you the CD, Little Egypt's music is available 
        at Bull Moose Records in Brunswick, Portland, and Bangor. The title of 
        the CD is Straight Out the Sands and includes many songs that the group 
        performed here at Bowdoin so be sure to check it out before they sell 
        out...of the CD that is. Little Egypt is one rap group that I'm pretty 
        sure will never sell out. From a down-to-earth attitude and a desire to 
        reach a diverse audience, these talented musicians are on a road to success 
        that will most likely take them bigger places than our gym. </p>
