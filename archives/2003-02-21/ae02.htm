      <p align="left"> Call me crazy, but aren't superheroes supposed to be cool? 
        Cause this Daredevil character is kind of a jerk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I mean, he kills an acquitted rapist, but not the evil corporate mastermind 
        behind dozens of deaths. He pretends to be blind when it's quite clear 
        that his &quot;superhuman&quot; senses, or whatever the heck they are, 
        make him just as capable as the next guy. And one more thing-he hits girls. 
        That's how he flirts with them. I don't know about the rest of you, but 
        I don't think I would want this guy protecting justice, truth, and the 
        American way. But it looks like Marvel's run out of cool superheroes to 
        make movies about-Batman's already got two more movies on the way, and 
        Spiderman's sequel is filming right now. But in the meantime, for lack 
        of a better idea, they give us this guy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Horribly conceived, written, cast, and filmed, Daredevil, this month's 
        most hyped film is the first signpost on the road to Hollywood's &quot;ordinary 
        time,&quot; that period early in the year where all the bad movies frolic 
        freely on our screens since the good movies are smart enough to wait until 
        awards season and the summer movies are waiting for, well, summer. It's 
        a sad time for film quality, but that doesn't mean there's no money in 
        it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After months and months of expensive trailers, magazine covers, and interviews, 
        the cinematic snake oil salesmen behind the film's promotion got what 
        they bargained for: $40 million on opening weekend-beating out last year's 
        record. Sigh.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In Daredevil, Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), a rich self-made lawyer from 
        a tough neighborhood, is out saving the world in a maroon pantsuit driven 
        by an anger sparked by his father's death. Sound familiar? Maybe like 
        every other superhero? Well, get this: he gets his powers from a freak 
        accident involving toxic chemicals. Take that, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
        The accident leaves Matt blind, but all his other senses are enhanced 
        to such a degree that he can pretty much see anyway-through some radar 
        sense thing that gives the special effects guys a field day. Cowabunga. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        While he's out killing clients he couldn't defeat fairly in court, Matt 
        meets his lovely leading lady, Elektra, played painfully by-the-book by 
        TV star Jennifer Garner. As they play their little courting game, the 
        big bad guy in the top floor of the corporate office, Fisk (Michael Clarke 
        Duncan) smokes a big cigar and plots to kill her father. He enlists one 
        of the kookiest villains I've ever seen-second only to Bee-Bop and Rock 
        Steady-a frantic weirdo named Bullseye (Colin Farrell in his umpteenth 
        role in the past few months). Without giving too much away, somewhere 
        after the corny sex scene with the long, flowing hair, cutesie harp-plucking 
        music, and a closing shot of a warm fireplace (vomit), something happens 
        that makes Matt feel guilty and ashamed, but then spurs him on valiantly 
        toward semi-victory.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In case you thought it couldn't get any worse than George Clooney as Batman, 
        they give us Ben Affleck. Poor guy can't catch a break. Armageddon, Sum 
        of All Fears&#133;he's got shallow blockbusters up the wazoo. Where's 
        the appeal? According to a junior high school girl sitting behind me, 
        &quot;he's got such a cute butt!&quot; Enough said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Affleck doesn't only play a real jerk; Daredevil, more so than the heroes 
        that have come before, is also a pretty annoying showoff. Superman knew 
        when to just leap from tall buildings and be done with it. This guy can't 
        seem to do it without four double somersaults and Matrix-like whooshing 
        noises. When Batman suited up, he didn't make a big show of it-just buckled 
        in the suit and went on his way. Daredevil's got to swing his nun chucks 
        around aimlessly a few times before he gets on to fighting crime. The 
        X-men knew when to sit back, relax, and just act normal. But D-boy here 
        likes to spend all his time standing on the corners of tall buildings, 
        feet apart, looking pretty stupid. I half expected a pigeon to poop on 
        his head.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But even this behavior pales in comparison to that of the hero's leading 
        lady, Elektra. Isn't staying alive a bit more important than looking good, 
        I ask? Take a tip from Tomb Raider, honey, and not all those bimbo Bond 
        girls: tie your hair back. It might make duels to the death a little easier 
        when you don't have to keep swishing your hair in slow-motion Pantene 
        Pro-V style. I will give her character credit for at least being able 
        to kick some butt-it's the twenty-first century, after all, and who wants 
        another damsel-in-distress Lois Lane princess to have to drop everything 
        for and go rescue over and over again. I'm sure that must have annoyed 
        the hell out of Superman. But still, no amount of Sensei training can 
        make someone catapult into the air and climb up walls the way this girl 
        does. Leave that to Jackie Chan and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where 
        it looks cool, because clich&eacute;s are never all that exciting, and 
        these are among the most boring fight scenes I've ever seen.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Daredevil's got nothing new, exciting, interesting, or (hearty chuckle) 
        enlightening to contribute to the superhero genre. Blankman was better 
        than this, fellas. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So if you're thinking of skipping The Life of David Gale, Gods and Generals, 
        or Chicago this weekend to go see Ben Affleck as an over-aged trick-or-treater 
        and Jennifer Garner in a feature-length Revlon commercial, I have one 
        thing to say: don't you dare.</p>
