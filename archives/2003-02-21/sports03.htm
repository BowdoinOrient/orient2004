      <p align="left">The second-ranked Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey Team is poised 
        to take over Dayton Arena, the NESCAC tournament, and ultimately, the 
        Frozen Four. Tonight the Bears face Middlebury College in a game that 
        will determine not only who hosts the upcoming NESCAC tournament, but 
        also the following NCAA tournament as well. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The entire student body has a chance to help these athletes in their pursuit 
        of a national title. Show up to Dayton Arena at 7:00 p.m. and catapult 
        the Panthers back to Vermont. To quote a real wordsmith, &quot;Look, if 
        you had one shot, one opportunity to seize everything you every wanted 
        in one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Do everything you can to prevent these slashing Bears on ice from slipping. 
        Junior forward Gillian McDonald announced, &quot;The fans are so vital 
        at this point in the season,&quot; and defensemen Kirsten Larsen said, 
        &quot;Yo, my fans best be present!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Speaking of the best, Bowdoin blanked the Mules 6-0 in action against 
        rival Colby College. In the contest, senior standout Shelly Chessie finally 
        broke the Bowdoin College all-time scoring record as part of her four-assist 
        display. Chessie passes former star Carol Thomas in the books and is looking 
        to add to her totals as the season continues into the playoffs. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Goalie and captain Emily McKissock '03 notched 17 saves in the victory. 
        The scoring came from three-time NESCAC Player of the week Marissa O'Neil 
        '05 with two goals, dominating defenseman and junior captain Sadie Wieschhoff, 
        first-year forward Nicki Young, and sophomore defensemen Katie Duglin 
        and Cathie Quinlan. Duglin's ripper from the blue line in the second period 
        gave the Bears a 4-0 lead and took the fight from the Mules. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Chessie complimented her teammates as vital parts of her personal success. 
        Speaking about fellow line mate O'Neil, Chessie said, &quot;I like playing 
        with Marissa. We play a lot alike. I don't have to look-I know she's going 
        to be in the corner when I want her there and vice-versa. We both want 
        the puck in the same places.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Chessie also noted the crucial link between a successful team and one 
        that gets along. &quot;It's definitely the best year. We've developed 
        a lot in my four years; the community support now is unbelievable. Also, 
        I feel like we are a team that wants to hang out on our off nights and 
        that is key,&quot; added Chessie. </p>
      <p align="left">
        When asked about breaking the record, Chessie revealed two thoughts, &quot;I 
        cried when they announced it, not because I got it, but because it is 
        all going to end soon. I don't care if I get another point as long as 
        we win from here on out.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears are certainly on their way. After the Colby win, Bowdoin rolled 
        over Amherst and Hamilton on the longest road trip of the season. In the 
        3-0 win over the Lord Jeffs, first-year Natalie Morgan made seven saves 
        in the complete game shutout and was supported by goals from McDonald, 
        Kelsey Wilcox '06, and senior captain Beth Muir. Three-sport varsity athlete 
        Britney Carr '04 added two assists in the contest. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the Hamilton win, McKissock posted 27 saves, and goals came courtesy 
        of Muir, Kirsti Anderson '05, Chessie, McDonald, and Wilcox. With the 
        win, Bowdoin pulled its record to a stellar 20-0-2, and coach Michelle 
        Amidon rests just one victory away from posting the third best record 
        in NESCAC Women's Ice Hockey history.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the season reaches its climax, the team oozes confidence. Senior Ba 
        Lanoue said, &quot;We've been working hard all season, and I feel confident 
        that we can challenge any team that we meet. We have a lot of depth which 
        really helps us in game situations-we are multipurpose players.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Teammate O'Neil said, &quot;As we approach the last weekend of NESCAC 
        games, we are looking at them as playoff games. They are must-win situations 
        so we can host NESCACs and possibly bring the Frozen Four to Brunswick.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Come to the ice tonight. Support history in the making-you have a responsibility 
        to your friends, your school, and yourself. &quot;You only get one shot, 
        do not miss your chance to blow, this opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
        yo!&quot;</p>
