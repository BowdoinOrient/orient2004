      <p align="left">As the seniors prepare for their last meet of their four-year 
        careers, a few reflect on some favorite or humorous moments with one of 
        the best teams around. Without further ado, I present the senior swimmers.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Jenn Laraia swims the 50, 100, and 200-yard breaststroke events and hails 
        from Connecticut. She fondly remembers many long training trips, especially 
        the one to Hawaii, but her favorite moments are NESCACs (lucky for Jenn, 
        she still has one more to go!). </p>
      <p>Laraia fondly recalls NESCACs as the times &quot;when the whole team 
        comes together, wearing all sorts of ridiculous clothing-Polar Bear ears, 
        capes, socks, and macaroni necklaces-and swims really fast. It's great 
        when everyone gets pumped up and has some amazing swims. It makes all 
        the practicing pay off.&quot; Laraia thinks that the funniest swim team 
        tradition is not appropriate for the general public, but admitted that 
        &quot;there's always our triumph over the sketchy men in the woods!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Meredith Hoar originates from Maryland and found her events on the team 
        by coincidence. &quot;Before my sophomore year at Bowdoin, the longest 
        race I'd ever swum was the 100 freestyle,&quot; she said. However, due 
        to the lack of people to swim the 500 and 1000-yard freestyle events, 
        Hoar decided to fill the void. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Now I love being part of team distance! It's been fun to learn a 
        very different type of event,&quot; said Hoar. She also fondly remembers 
        Hawaii, but perhaps for different reasons! </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I've always been a bit accident- prone, but that year was out of 
        control. A bunch of us decided to jump off the 10-meter diving board one 
        day before practice, including me. I ended up flipping onto my backside 
        in midair, resulting in a couple of huge, unflattering bruises and a chipped 
        tooth.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Hoar also managed to have foot problems and an ear infection that landed 
        her in the hospital. She said, &quot;Hawaii was a lot of fun, but it hurt 
        too!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Will Thomas, hailing from New York, has swum just about every event, but 
        is currently swimming for team distance. Thomas eloquently revealed one 
        of his finest moments with the swim team.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;My most embarrassing moment came last year when Elliot pushed me 
        in the pool. In mid-air, I spun 180 degrees and saw that I was heading 
        directly for the lane-line. In a moment of desperation, I tried to throw 
        my body to one side, but unfortunately only managed to spread my legs 
        wide apart. I don't particularly remember the landing, but the way that 
        it has been recounted to me goes as follows: I hit the lane-line straight 
        on and in an upright sitting position.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        He continued, &quot;Upon impact, I leaned forward and grabbed it with 
        my hands to stabilize myself. I continued to sit there, groaning, until 
        my vision came back. To top it off, I was still-except for my lower legs-completely 
        dry. That is, until I rolled into the pool. It is now, over a year later, 
        humorous to think about. And just as painful to recount.&quot; His favorite 
        moment was watching teammate Nick Driskill '03 make the national cut last 
        year in the 100-yard breaststroke. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As for myself, I'm a breaststroker from Wisconsin. One of my favorite 
        parts of the swim team has been convincing my fellow teammates that my 
        family owns a cheese factory, and that I have my own pet cow. Though I 
        live in a city, I have gotten a few swimmers to eat frozen custard and 
        cheese curds. This fits in with other funniest memories like wedgies at 
        practice, Brad riding the pony, explaining the strange markings and shaved 
        arms, and making princess hats and tye-dyed leg warmers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I think, though, that my favorite part of the swim team will always be 
        memories of dinners, talking, laughing, and staying until they close it 
        down. </p>
