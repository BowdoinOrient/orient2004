        Dave Eggers newest: two stars</p>
      <p>Somebody please get Dave Eggers a tourniquet. He's bleeding all over 
        the place and wants the entire viewing population of MTV2 to get a good 
        look. He's walking into every coffeehouse from the Lower Haight to the 
        Upper Village yelling, &quot;I am earnest! I am earnest!&quot; leaving 
        a legion of disciples in his wake. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He has just released his second novel, You Shall Know Our Velocity, a 
        loosely sketched &quot;tour de force&quot; that piles a heap of conflicted 
        emotions about death, friendship and love on top of what amounts to a 
        travel guide to Western Africa and Eastern Europe. Will and Hand, the 
        novel's two protagonists, are mourning the death of their friend Jack. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Will comes into a large sum of money and somehow decides that a trip around 
        the world with Hand will help with the grieving process. During the trip, 
        the two plan to give away the rest of the money to people that they deem 
        worthy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The conflicts that arise between the two friends on this trip range from 
        sexual jealousy to comparisons of who is a better friend to the other 
        to what impoverished people are more deserving of the money than others, 
        and this wide array of difficult themes stretches the novel way out of 
        Eggers' grasps so that the last hundred pages read like a series of angsty, 
        emotionally diarrhetic journal entries. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In his first novel, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, Eggers 
        succeeded in reigning in his more colorful flairs and language by centering 
        the novel on his own conflicted and admittedly self-obsessed thoughts. 
        You Shall Know Our Velocity strays outside the Eggers formula of me, me, 
        me, but fails in holding together a cohesive or compelling story. The 
        sentences ache for tightening that Eggers' publishing company McSweeney's 
        did not provide and his old bag of tricks feels stale (the first page 
        of the novel is printed on the cover, complete with the atrocity, &quot;It 
        was an eyeblue day.&quot;) . A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, 
        for its part, was not a skillfully written book, but Eggers' ability to 
        precariously balance tragedy with cuteness and humor with discomfort and 
        quick pace with almost unbearable moments of reflection made reading the 
        novel the literary equivalent to watching a bobsled crash across the finish 
        line. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like with Salinger's Buddy Glass, you wanted Eggers to sort things out 
        because there were those moments when nobody seemed to be more true-to-life 
        or honest. Almost all of that reckless charm is gone from You Shall Know 
        Our Velocity and replacing it is constant motion and stagnant emotion.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Instead of layering the frantic self-searching like he did in A Heartbreaking 
        Work of Staggering Genius, Eggers just lays what happens to Will and Hand 
        next to what Will and Hand think about death and the result makes you 
        want to skip over large chunks of text. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eggers' style of navel gazing melodrama is hardly original, but his flair 
        for publicity has vaulted him into a rare American literary celebrity 
        status. His books and short stories are deemed &quot;buzzworthy&quot; 
        by MTV and a growing population of teenagers and twenty-somethings eagerly 
        await his next appearance in print with the same cultish attentiveness 
        that many of their parents devoted towards Mr. Salinger's hill in rural 
        New Hampshire. </p>
      <p align="left">
        His novels mention The Real World and Mr. T, and he goes on book tours 
        with nerd-rockers They Might Be Giants and smashes up hotel rooms. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He is young literary America's rock star and bears the responsibilities 
        that go along with that sort of fame. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Instead of merely focusing on the content of his novels, Eggers has to 
        package them differently, provide pyrotechnics for his book tours and 
        wiggle his way into the media spotlight usually reserved for much better 
        looking and charismatic men. Salinger has held the public's fascination 
        captive by disappearing into mystery. Eggers seems to want to hold it 
        by exposing himself as much as possible. It works. The sales for You Shall 
        Know Our Velocity are alarming for a novel distributed by a small, independent 
        press, and youth literary journals like Our Time is Now are sprouting 
        up naming Eggers as inspiration. </p>
      <p align="left">
        His popularity comes from the fact that he is a gimmick writer in an era 
        where young readers need that extra hook or special effect to keep their 
        interest. In A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, Eggers' tricks 
        were fresh and they worked well within the honest, open structure of the 
        novel. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For example, the itemized list of expenses incurred during the writing 
        of the book that he included in the book's introduction sent the clear 
        message to the reader that Eggers was not part of the Prestige class of 
        novelists and that he did not see writing as some holy art where the author 
        is the giant on the hillside coming down every few years to visit his 
        public. This open-handed approach to writing has reverberated throughout 
        the guild of young writers, as more and more books are printed with illustrations 
        and self-effacing jokes on dust jacket flaps. Zadie Smith, England's young 
        literary superstar, recently released her second novel, The Autograph 
        Man, is burdened with unmistakable Eggersian touches (the two collaborated 
        on McSweeney's Quarterly Journal #4)-like quirky fonts and self-referential 
        humor-and suffers as a result. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, it is undeniable that it was this sort of Warhol-style unraveling 
        of entrenched thoughts that writing was some holy act of creation that 
        made A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius exactly what the title 
        advertised. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eggers was a writer with a story worth telling, but he was going to keep 
        you reading with innovative techniques. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps, now saddled with his own celebrity and the pressures of maintaining 
        all that Dave Eggers has become, he is struggling to find a story that 
        isn't about just himself.</p>
