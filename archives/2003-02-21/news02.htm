      <p align="left">In an effort to combat budget shortfalls, Bowdoin College 
        plans to raise tuition fees by five percent over the next academic year. 
        For the 2003-2004 academic year, students will be paying $37,790, rather 
        than $35,990 to attend Bowdoin. Currently, tuition fees account for 49 
        percent of the College's revenue and the increase will add an additional 
        $2 million to the College's revenue.</p>
      <p align="left">
        President Barry Mills said trustees were very concerned with tuition increases 
        and &quot;trustees understand the economic conditions of the country&quot; 
        in regards to the burden tuition places on families and the financial 
        aid budget. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the proposed fee is expected to remain competitive among similar 
        colleges for 2003-2004, Bowdoin ranked third in its 22 College comparison 
        group for 2002-2003; the group includes colleges such as Middlebury, Trinity, 
        and Hamilton, as well as Bates and Colby. Amherst topped the tuition bill 
        with $36,098, and Swarthmore came in a close second with $36,092. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Overall, the degree to which numerous private colleges are attempting 
        to balance their budgets appears comparable to that of Bowdoin. According 
        to the Daily Princetonian, Princeton's &quot;new budget also projected 
        undergraduate fees to rise 4.5 percent to $36,649 and 52 percent of students 
        would be on financial aid.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although most public schools will not release their anticipated budget 
        decreases until the fall, the Bush administration has remained committed 
        to supplying $756 million for public universities in anticipation of rising 
        tuition costs and to &quot;help ensure America's parents have more choice 
        for their children.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Rising tuition costs are nothing new for the Bowdoin community, however. 
        Over the past five years, Bowdoin student fees have increased by 19.3 
        percent, which makes Bowdoin rank sixth among the 22 comparison group 
        colleges. Grinnell ranks number one with an increase of 25.1 percent while 
        Williams ranks last by only increasing their fees by 11.1 percent. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the rising tuition costs, Bowdoin is committed to its need-blind 
        admission policy which helps to attract the best students and improve 
        the diversity of the student body. To combat rising financial aid costs 
        associated with an increase in tuition, the college has dedicated $1.5 
        million to an unrestricted fund. In addition, the College's goal is to 
        boost the Financial Aid endowment by $35 million and Bowdoin is well on 
        its way to reach that goal. Currently, the College has received $20.3 
        million in cash and $8.8 million in commitments. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This year 40 percent of the student body is receiving an average of $23,000 
        in grant money to help pay for their stay at Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Grant money is currently being distributed to 717 students, including 
        those who study abroad. However, over the next academic year, student 
        loans and aid packages are likely to share some of the burden of increasing 
        costs. This could mean an increase in loans and a decrease in grant money.</p>
      <p align="left">
        When looking at similar colleges, Bowdoin is still competitive when it 
        comes to discount rates on tuition. During the 2000-2001 academic year, 
        Bowdoin's discount rate was 20.2 percent. Amherst gave the most, with 
        a discount rate of 26.4 percent, while Colby gave the least with at rate 
        of 19 percent.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The good news for those on financial aid is that a proposal increases 
        grant aid by 6.5 percent during the next academic year. This means that 
        the total aid budget is expected to reach $14.5 million by next year.
