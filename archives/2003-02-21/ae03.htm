      <p align="left">Unlike one of the characters from Eve Ensler's monologues, 
        the Bowdoin community is not worried about talking about vaginas. This 
        year marks the second showing of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> in Kresge 
        Auditorium. The red shirts and black pants are back and the set is largely 
        the same. However, two new monologues were added to the script and the 
        cast is all new making the show a completely different experience from 
        last year's production.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Directors Desneige Hallbert '05 and Maddie Robillard '05 wanted to make 
        sure that this year's show was not just a repeat of last years. When casting 
        the actors they purposely looked for students and professors who would 
        bring something new to their monologues. &quot;Many of the cast members 
        had never acted before,&quot; said Hallbert. &quot;In a way, that was 
        an asset to the production because it meant that everything was fresh. 
        We didn't want to hear the same monologues as we heard last year.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the directing process, it helped that Hallbert had been a member of 
        the cast last year. Though her onstage orgasms did not involve rolling 
        around on the floor, they were not dissimilar from the moans uttered by 
        her character this year. &quot;It was fun to direct someone else in the 
        monologue I performed because it gave me a chance to see what it looked 
        like,&quot; said Hallbert.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Becca Geehr '03 who directed the show last year considered directing again. 
        However, she decided that it would be too difficult; she felt she would 
        be unable to come in fresh. &quot;I just kept hearing last year's actors 
        in my head. It would have been impossible to direct new actors with that 
        mentality.&quot; Never the less, Geehr was involved in the show. In fact, 
        she was one of the actors. In an effort to avoid being tainted by the 
        voices of last year's performers, Geehr decided to perform one of the 
        new monologues.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At various colleges across the country and around the world, the performers 
        of The Vagina Monologues were asked to add new monologues to the show. 
        The topic was &quot;what would the world be like without violence against 
        women and girls?&quot; Two monologues were written by members of the Bowdoin 
        community-one by female students and one by male students.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It took a bit of prying to get the male students to participate 
        but I'm glad that they did,&quot; said Hallbert. Trying to get male participation 
        in the cause of V-Day is one of the goals of the show. &quot;Men have 
        a large part to play in the V-Day campaign,&quot; said Geehr. &quot;Violence 
        against women is something that affects everyone. It's something that 
        happens to people you know. It's something that happens on this campus. 
        I think everyone needs to realize that.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Besides the thrill of performing in front of an audience of their peers, 
        this year's cast will also have the rare opportunity to strut their acting 
        talents for Shael Norris. &quot;Norris is like Eve Ensler's right hand 
        woman,&quot; said Hallbert. &quot;It's such a privilege to have her here 
        to see the show.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left"> Next year's performance of The Vagina Monologues, which 
        is already scheduled, will be directed by ex-cast member Kristin Pollock 
        '04. &quot;After being involved in the show it's hard not to want to be 
        involved again,&quot; said Geehr. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Vagina Monologues are in Kresge Auditorium Friday and Saturday at 
        7:00 p.m.</p>
