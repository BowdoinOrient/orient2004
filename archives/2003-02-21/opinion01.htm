        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Many conservatives loathe &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; 
        Recently, I received an email from a conservative women's group called 
        &quot;Shethinks.org.&quot; It argued that &quot;Vagina Day&quot; promotes 
        &quot;female victimology&quot; and asked, &quot;Wouldn't you prefer to 
        restore mutual respect and a dash of romance&#133;on Valentine's Day?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The group sees &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; as part of the larger 
        objectionable feminist movement. This group does not want women to &quot;return 
        to the kitchen,&quot; rather it sees claims of &quot;oppression,&quot; 
        &quot;wage gaps,&quot; and suspicion toward men as illusory. It wants 
        to encourage romance and discourage &quot;hook ups.&quot; It holds radical 
        &quot;feminists&quot; and their ideology of &quot;patriarchy&quot; responsible 
        for the death of courtship on the campus, and believes that the &quot;Vagina 
        Monologues&quot; contributes to this movement. The group's website, shethinks.org, 
        offers a more detailed discussion of the position than I can offer here.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Its claims about &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; may be true at other 
        schools. However, I have no way of knowing. I have my own qualms with 
        the &quot;Vagina Monologues&quot; here at Bowdoin, one of which is its 
        advertising. I am sure many families with small children find it objectionable 
        to walk through our union and see posters describing the female sex organ 
        in lurid detail. A friend of mine told me recently she was appalled when 
        V-Day organizers were selling &quot;cunt cookies.&quot; I can't say I 
        blame her. However, the overall purpose of the play, to break silence 
        about sexual assault and violence against women, is admirable and deserves 
        our support.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At first I was skeptical of the show. I saw zero relation between the 
        word &quot;vagina&quot; and discouraging violence against women and embraced 
        much of the conservative rhetoric about the show. However, I attended 
        the show last year. Some of the skits offended me, but others were funny 
        or meaningful. It was not nearly as &quot;anti-man&quot; as I predicted. 
        I recall two skits where men are placed in heroic positions: one man rescued 
        his daughter from a sexual assault, and another skit talked about natural 
        childbirth, a situation where a man plays an instrumental role. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I still don't see the relation between the word and preventing violence. 
        However, multiple women connected with the show tell me-one even a staunch 
        conservative-that victims of sexual assault often &quot;break their silence&quot; 
        following a viewing of the show. I can't explain that, but if that is 
        really true, then we should support the show.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As we have learned from the recent scandal in the Catholic Church, sexual 
        abuse must be stopped and reported. The church scandal also showed that 
        sexual assault is not a women's issue, rather it is a fundamentally human 
        issue. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There is also nothing in the show that is against &quot;mutual respect&quot; 
        between the sexes. I talked to someone involved with the show recently, 
        and she told me that the &quot;V-Day&quot; organizers want to reach out 
        to men. As she said, campaigns against &quot;violence against women&quot; 
        are ineffective without men. There is at least one male monologue in this 
        year's play. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nor is there anything &quot;unromantic&quot; about the &quot;Vagina Monologues.&quot; 
        Someone involved with the show told me that she would be &quot;very impressed&quot; 
        with a man who had either seen or read &quot;The Vagina Monologues.&quot; 
        My suspicion is that for my fellow men, the question &quot;what did you 
        think of the 'Vagina Monologues?'&quot; will get you more dates than &quot;come 
        here often?&quot; &quot;that's a great thing you said in class about Machiavelli,&quot; 
        or any other standard &quot;pick up line.&quot; I apologize for treading 
        into Oppenheim's territory, but love and politics both involve making 
        good first impressions and then surviving ineluctable vicissitudes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you're still skeptical about &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot; I strongly 
        urge you to see the show, especially if you think the show is &quot;anti-man,&quot; 
        &quot;femi-nazi,&quot; &quot;unromantic,&quot; etc. By themselves, these 
        labels lack intellectual vigor. They are below the level of a liberal 
        arts education.</p>
