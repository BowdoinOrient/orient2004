      <p align="left"><font size="5">Are Arab Americans in danger?<br>
        <font size="2">BEN KREIDER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Republicans have long had the reputation of being racially 
        insensitive, and their racism has been even more rampant during the war 
        on terror. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's remarks about Strom 
        Thurmond's segregationist campaign for president made headlines and rightly 
        appalled the American public. His comments reinforced the Republicans' 
        image as a party of intolerant, insensitive white members of the old boys' 
        network.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Recently a prominent Republican member of Congress made matters even worse. 
        During a call-in radio show, Representative Howard Coble from North Carolina 
        endorsed the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. His 
        remarks came in response to a caller who suggested that Arab-Americans 
        be put into internment camps similar to those used during World War II. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Coble said that he did not agree with the caller, but that he did agree 
        with President Roosevelt's decision to confine Japanese Americans after 
        the bombing of Pearl Harbor. &quot;We were at war. They (Japanese Americans) 
        were an endangered species,&quot; Coble said. &quot;For many of these 
        Japanese Americans, it wasn't safe for them to be on the street.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The congressman's comments were disturbing enough on their own, but his 
        position makes his mistake even more egregious. Coble just happens to 
        the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland 
        Security. While he allegedly does not want to confine Arab Americans, 
        he is actually the individual who would be in the position to do so. All 
        sensible Americans who support civil liberties should be outraged that 
        such a powerful elected official would have such antiquated views.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While Coble's alleged desire to protect the Japanese Americans from harm 
        is admirable, the language he used is reprehensible. Referring to Japanese 
        Americans as &quot;an endangered species&quot; is a very racially loaded, 
        insensitive remark. Such a comment would be terrible to make at any time, 
        but it is especially dangerous amid the increased racial sensitivity during 
        the war on terror.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A house divided cannot stand, and in these dire times, the U.S. must stand 
        united against racial hate and terrorism. If we are to fight a truly effective 
        war on terror, we must limit domestic racial tension. Americans must not 
        judge each other by their ethnicities, religions, or genders; they must 
        recognize their fellow Americans as allies, not enemies. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It is up to our nation's political leaders to set a good example for citizens 
        to follow. Any politician, let alone the head of one of the most important 
        and relevant congressional subcommittees at this time, should make it 
        a point to avoid making racially or otherwise offensive remarks. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Representative Coble must act swiftly and appropriately to atone for his 
        sins. The Japanese American Citizens League has called Coble and asked 
        him to apologize. The American Arab Anti-Discrimination League has asked 
        him to explain his remarks. Clearly, he must apologize to Japanese Americans 
        for his hurtful words.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Secondly, he must resign as chairman to show his sense of leadership. 
        An online petition to lobby for Coble to resign as chairman and apologize 
        for his remarks is located at http://www.petitiononline.com/coble03/petition.html. 
        It currently has over four thousand signatures.</p>
