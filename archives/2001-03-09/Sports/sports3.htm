      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postseason play came to an end for the men's hockey 
        team last Friday in a 3-0 loss to Amherst. The Polar Bears finished with 
        a 14-10-1 overall record, and were content with the season's results. 
        "Looking back on the season, I am extremely proud of the way the team 
        came together and played," captain Alex Tatum '01 said. "We weren't expected 
        to do much in the league, as we lost a lot of seniors last year."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Coach Terry Meagher agreed. "I'm pleased with our 
        season; I feel our athletes played hard and represented the school, and 
        the uniform, in the proper way."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears went out fighting in the first NESCAC semifinal 
        game last Friday. Second-seeded Amherst took a decent lead after two goals, 
        separated by 24 ticks, in the second period. "Going into it, we knew it 
        would be tough," Meagher said. "Both teams were struggling to adjust to 
        the bigger ice surface. We certainly didn't give up, and had a lot of 
        chances. Their goaltender played very well."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amherst's Jim Smith would wrap the game up at 3-0 with 
        a late third-period goal. "They got two great scoring opportunities in 
        a minute span, and took advantage of them," Tatum said. "We definitely 
        had our chances, but just couldn't capitalize on them." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin Robinson '01 made 15 saves during the matchup, 
        and Brian Losier '01 added one. Amherst's Nick Resier rejected 16 shots 
        in the victory. The Jeffs advanced to last Saturday's NESCAC championships, 
        and wound up at the losing end of a 4-3 overtime game with Middlebury. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Meagher acknowledged that post-season play is 
        always valuable for his squad. "That Amherst team was a veteran one," 
        he said. "It gives us experience and a taste of the hard work required 
        to get to that level." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatum also indicated that low expectations from the 
        league might have encouraged the Bears to work harder. "I think the fact 
        that we were picked so low gave us a boost, because we wanted to prove 
        that we were one of the contenders in the league," he stated.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2000-2001 season included big wins over Colby, Trinity, 
        and Babson, and a great matchup against the U.S. National Under-18 team. 
        Certain players were cited for their contributions this winter. "The team 
        got great play out of some key people, especially Colin in between the 
        pipes," Tatum said. "The junior class really stepped up in to a leadership 
        role throughout the season, and will lead next year's team well. They 
        have a great nucleus returning."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The leadership we got from our captains and other three 
        seniors was instrumental in the season," Meagher added. "Also, Brian Shuman 
        played very strongly and was a factor in each and every game." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the forward line, he said, "We were excited 
        about the record-breaking season Chris [Pelletier] had. And Mike Carosi 
        was Mike Carosi." Pelletier finished at the top of team stats, totaling 
        28 points on the season with 18 goals and 10 assists. Junior Carosi was 
        right behind him with 27 points, followed by Sean Starke's 22 and Adam 
        Mantin's 21. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher said that there are some specific things the 
        team will be working through next year. "We need to find more ways to 
        get production out of our forwards," he stated. "We're really going to 
        focus on that."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the spring semester is a regrouping time 
        for the men, as many of them play on other sports teams and turn their 
        focus to academics. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coaching staff, in preparing for next season, develops 
        summer and preseason workout programs for the team to follow until the 
        ice is ready for them again next November. </p>
