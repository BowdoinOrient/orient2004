      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin College Women's Hockey team has laced their 
        skates up for the last time in the 2000-2001 season. An overtime playoff 
        loss to the #2 seed Williams squad put a close to the campaign. The Bears 
        fell by a final tally of 5-4 to the Ephs, who are currently ranked second 
        in the nation behind Middlebury. It was the second time this season that 
        the two teams had met, with Williams getting the better of it both times. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday night, February 24, the Ephs would jump 
        out to a 3-0 lead at the end of the first period. Bowdoin came back onto 
        the ice with a sense of purpose in the second, lighting the lamp four 
        times to take the lead. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-year Gillian McDonald would spearhead the attack 
        with a quick pair of goals, scoring twice in the first seven minutes of 
        the period. She then turned over the scoring duties to Ba Lanoue '03 who 
        picked up a pair of her own to hand the Bears the lead, 4-3. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead would be short-lived as Williams would get 
        the equalizer with just nine seconds to go in the second. The teams fought 
        a scoreless battle in the third frame, sending the game to an extra-period 
        knotted at four apiece. The overtime period played out much like the third 
        did. Neither team could manage to pick up the decisive score until Williams 
        finally netted the game-winner with 1:03 left to play. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Bears didn't manage to pull this one 
        out, Head Coach Michele Amidon picked it as one of the highlights of the 
        season. "We were down 3-0 after the first period and we came back to score 
        4 goals in ten minutes…that shows heart and character!"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So another season draws to a close. With the exception 
        of bowing out earlier than they would have liked in the playoffs, it was 
        a good year for the Bowdoin women. Coach Amidon said, "Without a doubt 
        we have one of the most talented women's ice hockey teams Bowdoin has 
        ever produced." They ended the season ranked fifth in the nation, where 
        they were a fixture for most of the year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears sported a 16-5-3 record on the season. Of 
        those five losses one was to D-I Boston College, two were to Williams, 
        and the other two also came at the hands of nationally ranked teams. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same story goes for the ties; Bowdoin ended three 
        games without a winner and all three times both teams were ranked. Against 
        defending national champion and current number one Middlebury, the teams 
        fought to a 3-3 standstill. The tie was the first non-victory for Middlebury 
        in 102 league games and it is the only blemish on their ECAC record in 
        the last five years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears have every reason to be proud of themselves 
        after this season's performance. And with a young team, they have every 
        reason to be optimistic about next season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin was led offensively this year by a sophomore 
        and a pair of first-years. Shelly Chessie '03 led the team in both goals, 
        with 19, and assists (15), for 34 points. Britney Carr '04 was second 
        on the squad in scoring with 28 points divided evenly between scores and 
        helpers. Her classmate McDonald rounded out the big three with 27 points 
        15 on goals and 12 on assists. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine out of the top ten in points on the team were underclassmen 
        this year, a stat that certainly bodes well for the future. Only seven 
        of the 21 players on this year's team were juniors or seniors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though six seniors will be graduating, that means that 
        the majority of the team will remain intact next season. Remember to keep 
        your eye on them next season as they aim for new heights.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six seniors who are graduating are Erin Jaworski, 
        Kim Mimnaugh, Gloria Sonnen, Ashley Cotton, and Katie Worthing. All of 
        them deserve a round of applause for their four years of hard work, dedication, 
        and success. May their success after Bowdoin continue as they set forth 
        on the rest of their lives. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Amidon offered praise for this year's team and 
        optimism for next season: "Overall it was an outstanding season and we 
        are looking forward to continuing our success next year." Until next year 
        then, keep your skates sharp and as always Go U Bears!! </p>
