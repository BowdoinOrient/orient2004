      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the success this season of the women's basketball 
        team, this spotlight athlete will still be in season when you read this. 
        Senior tri-captain Lauren Myers is under the spotlight this week as she 
        helps lead the most successful Bowdoin team ever. "Lauren's leadership 
        this season has been a big part of our success.," according to head coach 
        Stefanie Pemper who had nothing but good things to say about Myers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myers has helped guide the Bears to a 21-7 record, the 
        most wins ever for a Bowdoin squad, and NCAA victories over Eastern Connecticut 
        and Salem State (for more on the team see the women's basketball article). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight the Bear's will be taking the court at New York 
        University in a sweet-sixteen match-up that Myers hopes won't be her last: 
        "I am lucky to have had my senior season extended a couple of weeks, and 
        hopefully one more. Being in the Sweet Sixteen is a great honor, but we 
        are definitely not stopping there."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How'd Lauren get to this point though? I'm glad you 
        asked. Myers first picked up the roundball at age eleven for her church 
        league team in South Boston. She says her love of basketball wasn't solidified 
        until she joined a local AAU team at 13. That team went to the national 
        tournament and according to Myers "from then on I knew that basketball 
        was the sport that I wanted to pursue." Growing up in Boston Myers rather 
        naturally was, and still is, a Celtics fan, from games at the Garden when 
        she was little to the poster of her favorite player, Larry Legend, that 
        still hangs on her wall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most athletes, or anyone who plays sports at all, 
        Myers is rather superstitious, her favorite one started years ago: "I 
        have a lucky hair tie that I got when I was 13. Until last season I had 
        worn it in every game I played in from that time. However, I was forced 
        to retire it because it had taken quite a beating, but I still bring it 
        to every game."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since her arrival at Bowdoin Myers has been under the 
        tutelage of Coach Pemper. Myers credits her coach with helping her grow 
        as a person as well as a player; "yes, she has helped me to become a better 
        player, but more importantly, she has helped me to learn a lot about myself 
        and about life in general." Basketball has played a big role in Myers' 
        time at Bowdoin, she points to it as one of the highlights of her Bowdoin 
        experience, relishing her time with teammates and the experience in general. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Myers "I have been able to play with some of the 
        most amazing teammates, and share great experiences with them off and 
        on the court…Being an athlete here at Bowdoin has definitely enriched 
        my college experience."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for her time after Bowdoin, Myers isn't sure what 
        she'll do yet, although she says she wouldn't mind doing a little traveling 
        first. Regardless of whether she has a game to suit up for next week Myers 
        says that she "could have never asked for a better way to end my career."
