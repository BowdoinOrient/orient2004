      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk among sports fans at Bowdoin has been the 
        women's basketball team's ascent to the "Sweet Sixteen" level of the NCAA 
        Division III tournament. Not far down on the list of sports news, is, 
        of course, Kristi Royer '03 and her stellar play in the tournament and 
        season thus far. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Royer leads the Lady Polar Bears in scoring and 
        in rebounds, her exceptional efforts over the past few weeks have not 
        gone unnoticed by NESCAC coaches. After starring in game against Eastern 
        Connecticut and leading the team to victory over Salem State this past 
        weekend, Royer was awarded the NESCAC Player of the Week. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Royer has already received the award this season, 
        she's still in search of new and greater marks of distinction--a national 
        championship, perhaps? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Saturday, Bowdoin defeated Salem State in 
        over-time to advance in the NCAA tournament. Royer led the team in scoring 
        with 23 points and also added nine rebounds. Stellar guard Jessie Mayol 
        '02 chipped in eleven points. Lauren Myers '01 scored eight points, while 
        Lora Trenkle '04 and Kristina Fugate '04 each scored seven points to aid 
        in the Bowdoin offensive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also contributing to the scoring effort were Nicole 
        Fava '03 with six points, Lindsey Bramwell '04 with five points, Courtney 
        Trotta '04 with three points, and Jamie Bennett '01 with two points. As 
        a team, Bowdoin proved its strength in foul shooting by sinking 29 of 
        35 attempts. Trenkle is ranked number one in the country for foul shooting, 
        making 88.2 percent.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only have the Lady Polar Bears experienced great 
        feats of individual and team performances, they have also surpassed expectations 
        to such a great degree that one has to wonder where they will end up. 
        From NESCAC champs to a "Sweet Sixteen" appearance-the first-ever in Bowdoin 
        women's basketball history-what a stellar season! And better yet, the 
        competition has just heated up; the Bowdoin team has proven itself ready 
        to face incredibly strong opponents-and to take it all the way. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royer comments before the game: "The team is incredibly 
        psyched up about making it to the Sweet Sixteen and is ready to play on 
        Friday. Going into the game, I think that one of the most important things 
        is that we have confidence in ourselves and in our ability to play as 
        a team; together we will achieve success." The team will take on New York 
        University (ranked number two) on Friday night at 8:00 in Manhattan. The 
        winner of this game will advance to play again on Saturday night in sectional 
        finals. <br>
