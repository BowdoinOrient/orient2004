      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High above the Atlantic in my mother's arms, I was 
        at peace on a plane bound for the Bahamas with my parents (oh, about 18 
        years ago). Donned in my cute Oshkosh overalls, I was star-struck (according 
        to Mom) as the actor Bill Murray made his way down the aisle, tapped my 
        head, and said, "Oshkosh-by-gosh." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Am I crazy, you ask? Well maybe, but I cannot 
        help feeling nostalgic when two of the best Division III indoor track 
        athletes that Bowdoin and the Northeast has to offer are headed to Oshkosh, 
        Wisconsin for this weekend's NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championship. 
        These two heroic individuals, Pat Vardaro '03 and Steve Allison '01, are 
        blessed with uncanny speed and ability that could carry them from Joshua's 
        Tavern and back before you even got out of the Tower elevator.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Men's indoor track season ended for all, except 
        Vardaro and Allison, on Saturday, March 3 at the ECACs held at Boston 
        University. The team finished a solid tenth out of forty teams, with a 
        significant number of the team's top point scorers not running in the 
        meet for one reason or another. James Wilkins '04 jumped 6'5'' in the 
        high jump, finishing third, capping off an amazing first year. Tim Pasakarnis 
        '03 jumped 6'3''. Brian Laurits '04 finished seventh in the 200m in a 
        time of 22.8 seconds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a team this year, we had a number of great performances, 
        fast times and big victories. I also think that the level of intensity 
        required to compete at the national level was conveyed to those whose 
        ultimate goal is to be that good," said Allison.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vardaro ran the kind of race that sends shivers down 
        a spectator's spine, winning the 5000m (3.1 mile) race in an unbelievable 
        time of 14:46, qualifying him for the NCAA Championship. While blowing 
        away the competition, Vardaro was on his way to setting a new Bowdoin 
        record in the indoor 5000m. Vardaro, who is currently ranked ninth in 
        the country in the 5000m, moved straight into the lead at the gun, and 
        pulled away for good from the lead pack with a mile to go in the race.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked to describe the 5000m race for Orient readers, 
        Vardaro grinned and said, "The 5000m race is a lot like a woman. If you 
        start off too fast, you'll get slapped in the face, but if you don't pick 
        it up as the race develops, you'll get dumped for someone better real 
        fast." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Peter Slovenski added, "Pat is running courageously 
        and leaving it all on the track." There is no shortage of commentary on 
        Vardaro's race. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pat had an amazing run. He had a look in his eye. He 
        was possessed and the people cheering him on all sensed this. It was beautiful," 
        said Allison.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison is seeded twelfth nationally in the 1500m. He 
        placed fourth in the 1500m on Saturday at ECACs, but has been battling 
        a virus for the past few weeks. Allison, an All-American in cross-country, 
        is one of the most powerful distance runners in the NCAA Division III. 
        In order to be All-Americans (top six in each event), Vardaro and Allison 
        must have a lot of luck and run their fastest times of the season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be play-by-play of both Vardaro and Allison's 
        races at Nationals via cell phone in Stowe 302 at 8:00 p.m. EST Friday, 
        and 3:00 p.m. EST on Saturday, March 10. By the way, could you guys pick 
        me up some new overalls? My old ones don't fit. (Stop by the room if you 
        want to listen. It should prove to be an exciting race) </p>
