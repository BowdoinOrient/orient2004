      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boston University hosted the ECAC meet for the 38 teams 
        competing this past Saturday. The Bowdoin women had a few notable performances 
        at the meet that led to their 23rd place finish overall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the individual performances of the day, Libby Barney 
        '03 had the most impressive finish. Barney placed 3rd in the 1000m run, 
        less than three-tenths of a second behind the 2nd place finisher and less 
        than three seconds behind the winner of the race. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only has she has been a consistent competitor throughout 
        the season and one of the team's highest point scorers, but Barney also 
        holds the state title in the 1000m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another strong finish of the day includes Marika Decyk's 
        '02 8th place finish in the pole vault. Decyk vaulted 9'10.25", a height 
        less than two inches of short of her personal best, which is currently 
        the school record. Decyk is also state champion in the pole vault.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relay events, the 4x800m team ran a strong race. 
        Lynne Davies '04, Bre-Anne MacKenna '03, Jane Cullina '04 and Libby Barney 
        '03 ran the relay. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women placed third overall, running a time of 9:48.40. 
        There was a close race between second and third place, with Bowdoin coming 
        in a mere two tenths of a second behind Wesleyan.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall the women had a solid winter season led by senior 
        captains Erin Lyman and Jeanne Boudreau. The entire team is training hard 
        and preparing for the spring season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team will continue their training over spring break 
        in San Diego, running at the University of San Diego. They will compete 
        against UCLA, University of San Diego and other teams in the area. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be some tough competition over break, but 
        that will only make the women more prepared to defeat the teams they will 
        face in the less than perfect running weather in Maine. </p>
