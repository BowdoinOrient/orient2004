      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's a 'nor'easter'?" one of my friends asked at dinner 
        the other night. Some people at the table thought it seemed like a silly 
        question. "It's a big storm that forms over the ocean…obviously…duh!" 
        they replied.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Why did this seem like common knowledge to most of the people 
        at the table? Oh yeah, most of the people at the table-indeed most of 
        the people at Bowdoin-are from the northeast. It's not like that's news. 
        I mean we've all heard the running joke that 50 percent of Bowdoin's student 
        population lives within 20 minutes of Boston. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder sometimes if all of the Massachusites (is that what 
        they're called? the only word I know is Mass-#$%*s) know about their covert 
        jargon. Seriously, there is a lot of lingo-"nor'easter" included-that 
        many of us who live west of Northhampton simply haven't ever heard. I 
        can figure it out when you call a pop a "soda;" process of elimination 
        tells me that "the cape" means Cape Cod. But I sure don't know the difference 
        between-or even the location of- Hotchkiss, or Andover, or Exeter. (And 
        the only way I know those names is from all of the high school sweatshirts 
        I see at the fitness center.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But back to the nor'easter-apparently something everyone 
        should know about. So let me fill you in, that is, if "the news" hasn't 
        bombarded you already. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'll admit, my news sources are random. I don't watch the 
        nightly news or read the New York Times every day. But I do make an attempt 
        to stay at least somewhat informed of what's going on outside the Bowdoin 
        Bubble. In fact, my default homepage is the Netscape News Channel...AND 
        my alarm is tuned to a radio station that reads the news. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the fact that my news sources may be somewhat 
        incomprehensive, throughout the past couple days the only news I've gotten-from 
        Netscape, the radio, and mostly word of mouth-has been "nor'easter...blizzard...snow…cancellations… 
        closings…commerce shut down…BUY YOUR MILK NOW!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It seems silly that this was breaking, important news…before 
        the snow had even fallen. Maybe the significance of the news of this storm 
        had to do with weather forecasters' new, accurate prediction technology; 
        the weather is such big news because we know so much about it. Or maybe 
        meteorologists have become progressively more dramatic; they sensationalize 
        the weather because it excites them. Possibly with Clinton out of the 
        White House, there just simply isn't much news, so weather makes the headlines-now 
        that our president is no longer a sensational, controversial figure who 
        riles up East Coast politics, media has filled this void by playing up…the 
        weather(?) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So anyhow, I checked out a real news source, thenewyorktimes.com, 
        to see if in fact this was the only news going on in the northeast or, 
        ahem, the world. Nope. Two students were shot dead in a high school near 
        San Diego; Dick Cheney underwent angioplasty; (and weather delayed travel). 
        Indeed, there were other considerable, more justifiably dramatic news 
        events occurring while all we were thinking about was the big "storm of 
        the century." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; All of this leads me to a couple of suppositions. First of 
        all, if I want to be informed, I can't rely on word of mouth. Professors 
        and students talked about the storm relative to the possibility of cancelled 
        classes. My dad called to give me "the news"…but my dad's favorite channel 
        is The Weather Channel. I guess I should read the New York Times every 
        day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, reporters' priorities seem odd. Do journalists 
        choose to report news that only directly affects their audience? And are 
        people only interested in news that directly affects them - does news 
        not matter until it means your flight or class is cancelled? I sure hope 
        not. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me back to what I was saying about the New Englander 
        lingo. It seems that people care most about their own part of the world. 
        Consequently, at Bowdoin, most folks are very centered on the New England 
        way of life. Don't get me wrong; I am just as guilty of focusing on my 
        own place of origin. I'm from the Midwest-ask me about a bubbler, or where-or 
        what-Sheboygan is. I'll be ready and willing to tell you as much about 
        vacationing in Minocqua, Wisconsin as you are willing to tell me about 
        "summering" in Newport, Rhode Island. Come visit my home turf-I'll show 
        you the difference between sharp and mild cheddar cheese and have you 
        taste a brat (pronounced "braht"). One thing's fer sherr: if you ever 
        do visit the Midwest, there won't be any "nor'easters." </p>
