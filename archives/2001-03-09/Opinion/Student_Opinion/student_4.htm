      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Curled up under a blanket, sitting Indian style here at 
        my desk, staring blankly at an equally blank screen, hot chocolate in 
        hand, candles lit, lights dimmed, I embrace the storm that the world seems 
        braced against. Sleep is doing pull ups on my eyelids, and with each heave 
        upwards, my lids sink further to closure. Just as the sun blinds a snow-covered 
        field in the dilated eyes of the indoorsman, the white fluorescence of 
        my computer screen blinds my vision to the darkness that is beyond me 
        in my room. A snowstorm rages beyond the comfort of my room, my only notice 
        a flickering light source, a rattling window, and an elusive wind that 
        is circling my exposed toes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There is something provoking about a night like this-thoughts 
        inevitably wander past any schoolwork to fantasy adventures and of places 
        and people far beyond that I have ever seen. A storm rages, but I am here, 
        cozy, left to think of things that often get brushed aside. My mind wanders, 
        and what is found is a conscious that I all to often don't get to hear. 
        Between weekend adventures (and the blow to the back of the head that 
        I suffered at the elbow of a drunken fool) and looming ever so daunting 
        weekly assignments yet to be completed, there is often little room for 
        the thoughts that exist in the forsaken parts of our imagination. My mind 
        drifts to this place, and to the plight of the frozen world that whirls 
        beyond.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I think of the snowflakes, how delicate and beautiful they 
        are. The individuality that they each posess, the plight that they all 
        must endure as the wind tears them in all directions. To what is their 
        fate attributed? Which one will land gracefully upon the hightest tree 
        top, and which will land upon a salty road, only to be somethered in the 
        brute force of an oncoming plow? But, of course, my mind's drifting is 
        as transient as the blowing snow, and before long my mind is shifting 
        to the schoolwork that lays before me. Oh, how I wish I could ignore its 
        demand, to allow sleep one final heave upon my resisting lids. But the 
        night is young, a storm rages oustide, and before long my mind is drawn 
        back to the journey of the snowflakes that are flying about.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't long before my thoughts of snowflakes carries me 
        to thoughts of travel, to the distant places that National Geographic 
        has shown me since I was a little kid. Images like those will always endure, 
        and questions of whether or not the Saharan desert is really as hot as 
        it appears or whether the rain forest is as magical as I believe it is, 
        will dominate my mind when that distant conscious of mine is allowed to 
        speak. But, my mind realizes, too, that the moment in which I sit is just 
        as beautiful as any of those which my imagination conjures. And the comfort 
        of my room, the enormity and grandeur of the storm that rages outside, 
        just as exotic to those people of the Amazon as their lives are to me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, however, a plow screams by, my hot chocolate trembles, 
        and so do I in its reflection. Snowflakes freeze outside, ice crystallizes 
        on my window, but steam rises from my drink in hand and warms my senses. 
        The dichotomy between hot and cold intersects somewhere in me, and my 
        awakened conscious gains control of my thoughts once again. School work 
        stares at me, so does the white screen, I'm still blind to that which 
        is my room beyond, and very much entranced by what seems a lack of continuous 
        thoughts. But before Sleep wins its battle, and before I tackle all that 
        it is that demands my attention, and before I decide what it really is 
        that I want in this life, I realize this: I would rather melt upon a sunlit 
        treetop than endure as a frozen crystal in a snowbank.</p>
