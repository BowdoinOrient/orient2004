      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I picked up Tuesday's paper, I was horrified to read 
        that it had happened again. On Monday, 15-year-old Charles Andrew Williams-"Andy" 
        to his friends - brought a gun into a boy's bathroom, and began to fire. 
        He killed two people and injured 13. The photographs of the scene came 
        first, followed tonight by photographs of Williams at his arraignment. 
        I can imagine that many people-myself included-have been looking at these 
        courtroom close-ups trying to see past the even, emotionless stare of 
        this babyfaced young boy. What, we cry in unison, would drive a 15-year-old 
        kid to do something like this?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the media. The first thing that they attempted to do, 
        of course, was to explain Andy Williams's actions. Apparently, he was 
        a kid who was "teased relentlessly" because of his weight (he was skinny). 
        Apparently, he had just moved to California from Maryland (his parents 
        were divorced). The thing that the media couldn't explain, though, was 
        that Andy Williams, despite his weight and feelings of displacement, was 
        a pretty popular kid. His friends say that he was funny, and, unlike the 
        Columbine killers, was not the member of a gang and did not listen to 
        Marilyn Manson. According to an ABC News report entitled "Friends Say 
        Accused Shooter is a Joker," one of Williams's Maryland neighbors was 
        quoted as saying: "He was always a good kid. He played sports - baseball, 
        football, and we always just run around did everything normal kids did." 
        In the next sentence, ABC reminds us - in case we've forgotten - that 
        "by many accounts, Williams was often teased." Of course, I don't mean 
        to suggest that we should not take the allegations of teasing seriously. 
        I imagine that many of us were victims of teasing when were younger, and 
        that we still harbor ill feelings toward those who teased us. What bothers 
        me, though, is that we find it so necessary to identify one aspect of 
        Andy Williams's life as the reason for his rampage. It seems strange that, 
        each time a school shooting occurs in this country, the media attempts 
        to address the questions that remain with a single answer. Why did Charles 
        Andrew Williams take a gun into his high school? The truth is that we 
        might never know, and our search for one answer trivializes the difficulty 
        of being an adolescent in our culture. Furthermore, if we pinpointed one 
        cause - a broken home, perhaps, or an obsession with violent films - do 
        we really believe that we could stop this plague in its tracks? Anyone 
        who works with teenagers knows that they are complex, oftentimes mystical, 
        and always surprising. Why, then, must we reduce Andy Williams - a boy 
        who was, by all accounts, funny, smart, and well-liked - to a simpleton 
        who acted because of a single set of easily identifiable motives? The 
        truth, I imagine, is quite a bit more complicated than that.</p>
