      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been a decade since Dr. Hannibal Lecter of Thomas 
        Harris' The Silence of the Lambs gave us shivers and made even the most 
        hardened movie watchers shun the horror section for a while. But on February 
        9, Lecter returned, along with FBI Agent Clarice Starling. New aspects 
        of the Doctor's package, in addition to Mason Verger, Hannibal on the 
        loose, and flesh eating pigs, got very mixed reviews from the critics. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Silence of the Lambs was released 10 years ago with rave 
        reviews, and won multiple Academy Awards. The much anticipated next chapter 
        of Harris' tale was on the shelves in 1999, with the film rights snatched 
        up by MGM Pictures/Universal Pictures shortly thereafter. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; With Hannibal on the lamb in Florence, Italy, now an art 
        curator, the movie begins, set seven years later. Anthony Hopkins returns 
        as the razor sharp antihero we all love to hate and hate to love. With 
        his civility and suaveness, we quickly remember the former Lecter of Silence. 
        The Lecter of Hannibal seems to be more in touch with his humorous side, 
        poking fun at the babbling FBI Paul Krendler as he dines, and using the 
        rather ridiculous phrase "okey dokey" a number of times while about to 
        commit another atrocity. However, the draw of Hannibal's dry smile and 
        comments is that he doesn't deliver punch lines for the crowd, he speaks 
        only entertaining himself with the ludicrousness he notices around him.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; One notable aspect of the new Lecter is that he is free to 
        roam and, thus, becomes more of a hunter. However, though free to do as 
        he pleases, whether it be to test the scent of a fine lotion or to dazzle 
        the esteemed scholars of Florence with his knowledge of their place and 
        history, he seems, nonetheless, less powerful than in his earlier role. 
        Seven years ago in the story, with the psychiatrist behind the sparsely-holed 
        Plexiglas, arms by his side, he was ever more imposing, as he controlled 
        the situation from within. But in Hannibal, the Doctor, able to easily 
        escape any of the snare set for him, is left to pursue his own ventures, 
        thus making his tasks of the mind or body just a little less brilliant. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Agent Starling, whose FBI status has been suspended because 
        of a botched arrest, caused by the disregard of her orders by D.C. police, 
        in which she killed a number people, is back on the case. Taking the role 
        of Starling is Julianne Moore, as Jodie Foster declined. She does the 
        role well, though at times is a bit cut and dry, but this is the expected 
        evolution of Starling's character. She lacks the same youthful vitality 
        of the earlier Starling. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Also on the Doctor's trail is millionaire Mason Verger, a 
        child molester formerly sent to Lecter for therapy. In a gruesome scene 
        occurring in years past, though only flashing in and out from the images, 
        Verger, having been drugged and influenced by Lecter, feeds his own face 
        to dogs. Now, he's a ghastly figure bent on revenge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Pazzi, a Florentine detective, disappointingly played 
        by Giancarlo Giannini, suspects that the art curator may be the notorious 
        Hannibal Lecter and is attempting to collect Verger's $3 million of reward 
        money on his own. However, the deep eyed detective finds this to be a 
        poor idea in the end, when Lecter mentions to him that he is seriously 
        considering eating his wife. Shortly thereafter, Pazzi takes the same 
        path as an ill-fated ancestor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Director Ridley Scott had a lot to live up to, following 
        the critically acclaimed worked of Johnathan Demme in The Silence of the 
        Lambs. However, he pulls it off well, portraying Hannibal superbly, exemplifying 
        Hannibal's ability to understand and dissect people. Although it has a 
        number of beautiful settings, which are just as disturbing because of 
        their context, the movie is shot much in haze, light often only peering 
        through a window. This adds to the already overwhelming sense of evil, 
        however pristine, that is embodied in Hannibal Lecter. The score, refined 
        yet dark, much like the villain himself, further lends to the well-directed 
        film. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As many directors have done, Scott takes a number of liberties 
        with Harris' plot. The film, however, comes through in many of the places 
        deemed unattainable early on by readers of the book and does so with force 
        and detail equal to any imagination. Some of the notable scenes and characters 
        that the picture lacks are Verger's bulky, eel-grabbing, and fratricidal 
        sister, the intriguing, thorough description of Lecter's vastly intricate 
        memory palace, and the entire ending, sparing Starling the humiliation 
        and sticking more to her original "in control" self. In addition, another 
        perk of the modified ending is that it leaves room for another episode 
        in the saga.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, though the movie was disliked by a number of 
        critics, few should or will miss this film. Hopkins' character is just 
        too (un)appealing to the crowd to keep them away. Scott sheds light on 
        the evil darkness that is the good Doctor. Julianne Moore accurately portrays 
        the developed Starling, though the character herself may be a little less 
        appealing. And, of course, the cannibal still draws in every onlooker, 
        keeping each perched on his every move, with his intelligence, refinement, 
        and malevolence tightly woven together. On the whole, whether loved or 
        not, Hannibal is a movie not to be missed or forgotten. </p>
