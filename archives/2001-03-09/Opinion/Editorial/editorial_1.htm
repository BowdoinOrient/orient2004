      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A collective sigh of relief escaped the mouths of Bowdoin 
        students on Tuesday when we were informed that classes would not be canceled. 
        Whew! A resounding victory for the forces of knowledge!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, not exactly. Many of us grumbled irritably as we trudged 
        our way through knee-deep snow and whipping wind. But at least, if we 
        were walking, we were only risking extreme sogginess. For those living 
        off-campus, the snow posed a more serious threat.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Although Bowdoin recognized this threat, the College did 
        not take the most effective measures to alleviate it for either staff 
        or students. Kent Chabotar's email indicated that "non-essential" staff 
        would not have to report to work. This terminology, with its needlessly 
        negative connotations, belies a fundamental flaw in Bowdoin's standard 
        response to severe winter weather. The focus should not be upon whether 
        one particular campus position is "essential," and another is not, but 
        rather upon individuals. That is, the College's policy should simply be 
        that those who can make it to campus in inclement weather, should. For 
        those who cannot, whether they are "essential" or not is irrelevant.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Organization on this principle encourages misconceptions 
        among students. Along with other departments, the Office of Student Records 
        was closed for the snow day. Given the current administrative vocabulary, 
        one might assume, then, that the office is somehow unimportant. Anyone 
        who has dealt with Student Records knows how fallacious an assumption 
        that would be!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Labeling certain services "essential" also feeds Bowdoin 
        students' sometimes unhealthy sense of entitlement. While the College 
        probably should provide some food for students, asking the entire dining 
        staff to show up during severe weather-weather severe enough that the 
        College considers it too risky for all employees to attend work-underestimates 
        Bowdoin students. Are we so pampered that our need for two varieties of 
        soup and a full deli bar should overshadow the dangers that dining staff 
        face driving to work in the blustery conditions of last Tuesday? Surely 
        we could make do with some milk, juice, and PB&J for a day.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Another implicit assumption in Bowdoin's current snow day 
        scenario is that all students live on campus. Perhaps this would be the 
        case if the College provided more, quality on-campus housing options. 
        But as it stands, where perpetual over-admittance makes students fortunate 
        to find accommodation in Stowe Inn and other hovels, many students are 
        left annually to scramble for off-campus housing. For these students it 
        is surely a slap in the face to be denied good housing, and then be asked 
        to make perilous car journeys to class. Sure, students could opt to stay 
        home, but should our policies really expect students to sacrifice personal 
        safety for academics?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin's severe weather policies do make us look hard-core; 
        no mere blizzard, raging for a paltry two days, is going to still Bowdoin 
        students' thirst for intellectual enlightenment. Yet, at what cost do 
        we maintain these policies? Other colleges in very similar situations, 
        including Bates, canceled classes and operated on very skeletal staffs 
        during the recent storm. And while a few students may have lamented the 
        class time lost and the slimmed dining options, it seems a safe bet that 
        the great majority of Bates' staff and students will not look back with 
        much bitterness upon the day it shut down. On most issues we might be 
        loath to admit the wisdom of our more primitive peer institution, but 
        on this one it is safe to say the Bobcats have blazed the best trail.</p>
