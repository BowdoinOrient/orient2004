      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Lieutenant Oliver Otis Howard, fresh out of 
        the Military Academy at West Point, stepped off the ship and surveyed 
        the town of Savannah, Georgia. He had never been to the South before, 
        and his assignment in the Department of Florida seemed filled with adventure. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was 1856, and young Oliver had no idea that eight 
        years later he would be at the head of an army of thirty thousand men 
        poised to burn Savannah to the ground. His career in the Union Army, however, 
        was far ahead of him.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ordinance officer, he reported to General William 
        S. Harney, his department commander, and settled down to a routine of 
        handing out and collecting weapons. At that time, there was a sort of 
        running war going on in Florida as General Harney attempted to conquer 
        the Seminole Indians. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stationed at Fort Brooke, Howard paid little attention 
        to the Seminole War, which was being fought all around him. He was more 
        concerned with his young family, which he had left North. Feeling ever 
        lonely, he turned inward and began to study the Bible. Within a few months, 
        Howard would become a true believer in the gospel.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As General Harney left the Department of Florida, a 
        new officer assumed control, and this new commander sent Howard, along 
        with a few companies of men, an interpreter, and a guide, to find Seminole 
        Chief Bow Legs. Howard was to offer the Chief a peace agreement. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching high and low, the small expedition failed 
        to encounter Chief Bow Legs, but after Howard left Florida, a treaty was 
        made. Howard believed that the treaty came partially as a result of his 
        efforts in trying to communicate with the Seminole chief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 
        his first assignment dealing with Native Americans, Howard went on to 
        become a math instructor at West Point, and soon enough, the Civil War 
        was upon him. After his successful career in the Western Armies, Howard 
        accepted the position of Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, charged 
        with helping to bring four million former slaves into freedom. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment turned out to be a bad career move for 
        Howard. He was assailed from all sides for his actions as Commissioner 
        and the problems would continue into the 1880s. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was, in 1872, an assignment that would place Howard 
        back in the field and away from the headache of Washington politics. The 
        government needed Howard to help negotiate a peace treaty with the warring 
        Apache Indians under Cochise in the Arizona desert. Howard accepted the 
        task, and on March 7, 1872, he left Washington for Arizona.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hell had broken loose in the desert. The story was 
        a common one. Settlers had been pushing westward in search of a better 
        life<br>
        --for some that meant gold, and for others that meant a ranch or land--when 
        they encountered Native Americans, who had been living on the land for 
        centuries. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides became violent, and soon a war was on. This 
        time it was courtesy of Cochise, chief of the Chiricahua Apaches, and 
        General George Crook, a hard-fighting Civil War veteran who subscribed 
        to General Phil Sheridan's maxim: the only good Indian is a dead one. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a last-ditch effort to prevent a war, the Government 
        sent Howard west to try to calm things down. Arriving at Fort McDowell, 
        Howard met with General Crook and persuaded him to halt his campaign until 
        Howard had tried his hand at peace negotiations. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard's efforts soon brought peace with a number of 
        tribes, including members of the Apache, Papago, and Pima. Howard's visit 
        to different tribes and efforts to create a new reservation in which the 
        Indians could be happily settled, helped smooth things out considerably. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his new friends, Howard returned to Washington 
        in June 1872. Still, a major portion of his assignment had been left unaccomplished. 
        Cochise was still on the rampage, and in May, Howard gave up hope of finding 
        him. He ordered Crook to begin again his war against Cochise. This was 
        music to General Crook's ears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, President Grant didn't like the idea very much, 
        and as soon as Howard reached Washington, the President sent him back 
        to Arizona.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard returned and began his search for Cochise yet 
        again. This time, however, he had the aid of a "scout" named Thomas Jeffords. 
        Howard assured Jeffords that he meant no harm to Cochise and was willing 
        to travel anywhere to find him, with or without military escort. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being said, a strange cast was assembled in the 
        desert. Howard, the scout, and two Native American guides rode into the 
        heart of Cochise's territory. The general was going out on a limb, knowing 
        full well what became of intruders who displeased the Apache Chief. Still, 
        he went along in search of peace.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been an interesting sight to see. Two Indians, 
        a rugged cowboy-type scout, and a major general in the United States Army 
        crossing the desert in search of a legend and in a quest to prevent bloodshed. 
        This was the stuff of great Western adventure movies, minus, of course, 
        the gunfights. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late summer 1872, Howard was in the middle of nowhere, 
        surrounded by thousands of hostile Indians, without an escort, and with 
        no escape plan whatsoever. His willingness to come thus far must have 
        proved his worth to Chief Cochise who soon came to a satisfactory agreement 
        with Howard. A new reservation was carved out on the Mexican border and 
        the Apache promised peace. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, his agreement was not written down, and in 
        time, misunderstandings of the terms of the treaty would cause some trouble 
        for General Crook, but in the meantime, Howard had accomplished his mission 
        and was heading home.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Arizona did not especially enjoy his return 
        from the desert, however. They wanted blood and kept demanding that Crook 
        go in with guns blazing and sabers drawn. Controversy would arise in the 
        years following the agreement as Indian raids into the Mexican border 
        and Cochise's claims of immunity from U.S. military control made the settlers 
        fear for their livelihood. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Oliver Howard was in the Department of Columbia, 
        commanding the Washington Territory, Alaska, Oregon, and Idaho. It was 
        1874, and there was peace throughout his department. But in 1877, he would 
        be on the campaign trail again, this time following the path of a desperate 
        Nez Perce Indian by the name of Chief Joseph.<br>
