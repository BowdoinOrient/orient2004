      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear Dr. Jeff: My daughter was seen in the Health 
        Center for a cough and a sore throat and was diagnosed with a "viral upper 
        respiratory infection." Two days later, she went to the Emergency Room, 
        was diagnosed with strep throat, and started on antibiotics. Why didn't 
        you do a strep test at the Health Center and start the appropriate treatment 
        then? She would have felt a lot better sooner. C.E.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear C.E.: Proper clinical evaluation and treatment 
        of a sore throat may be a little more complicated than you suggest. Many 
        things can cause a sore throat, including viral or bacterial infections 
        and post-nasal drip from sinus drainage or allergies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infections with Group A Streptococci (the bacteria that 
        cause "strep throat") are believed responsible for as few as five percent 
        of sore throats.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strep throats typically begin with a significant fever 
        and without a cough or other cold symptoms. A physical exam almost always 
        shows a deeply reddened throat, with pus on enlarged tonsils, and swollen 
        and tender neck glands.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two most common lab tests for strep throat are the 
        rapid strep test (performed in the office with results in five minutes) 
        and the throat culture (sent out to a hospital lab with results in two 
        to three days). Neither, however, is entirely reliable.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are significant numbers of false negative and 
        false positive results using the rapid strep test, especially if performed 
        at the first onset of symptoms. This test measures your immunologic response 
        to the presence of the strep bacteria. It is estimated that only 50 percent 
        of those with positive throat cultures demonstrate this response to a 
        degree measurable by a rapid strep test. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throat culture more accurately determines the presence 
        or absence of streptococci themselves. However, the mere presence of the 
        bacteria in someone's throat does not mean that they are responsible for 
        that person's symptoms. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He or she may be a chronic strep carrier and have a 
        sore throat for other reasons. Chronic strep carriers always have strep 
        growing in their throats and always culture positive for strep-whether 
        or not their throats are even sore and even after antibiotic treatment! 
        The strep carrier rate in healthy people approaches 20 percent. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can a diagnosis of strep throat be made accurately? 
        Through a process of clinical evaluation and judgment that balances out 
        a patient's medical history, signs and symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory 
        test results. There is rarely anything black-and-white about this process.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not every patient with a sore throat should have a strep 
        test or throat culture. This judgment should follow largely from the prior 
        evaluations. All tests, of course, have some inherent degree of inaccuracy. 
        They are most likely to be helpful in a setting when they are more likely 
        to be positive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antibiotic treatment for proven strep throats is fortunately 
        simple and definitely useful, although not for alleviating symptoms. The 
        purpose of treatment is to prevent rheumatic fever and other possible 
        (though uncommon) complications of streptococcal infection. Initiation 
        of treatment can be safely delayed for up to two weeks from the onset 
        of illness and may even be more effective if so delayed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnecessary antibiotic treatment, as we all know, should 
        be avoided. Antibiotics can cause allergic reactions, side effects, and 
        perhaps most importantly, the emergence of resistant organisms. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last point: at the end of all Health Center visits, 
        we all explain that illnesses evolve, that what we evaluate today might 
        look different tomorrow, that if things take a turn for the worse (or 
        don't improve within the expected time), then to please come back for 
        another visit. Our "same day appointments" and staff continuity make it 
        very easy to check and re-check again. That's an important component of 
        high quality care.<br>
