      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Midcoast Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Paul Ross, 
        was founded in 1990 and is now in its second year of residence at Bowdoin 
        College. Bowdoin students and faculty, along with members of the community, 
        come together to create a complete symphony orchestra which presents classical 
        concerts in Brunswick three times each season. This union is crucial in 
        providing advanced Bowdoin musicians with the opportunity to participate 
        in a full symphony orchestra.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, Bowdoin College holds a concerto contest in 
        the fall to determine which students will perform their orchestral solos 
        at the concert in March. A musical piece is considered a concerto when 
        it is composed of separate movements designed for a soloist and an ensemble 
        to play together. Students wishing to participate in the contest chose 
        a concerto piece they enjoy and perform it as their audition. This year's 
        winners, both members of Bowdoin's Class of '03, will perform as soloists 
        at a concert Sunday, March 11, at 3:00 p.m., in the Pickard Theater on 
        the Bowdoin College campus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The program features Joy Marie Giguere from Windham, Maine, 
        in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 16 in D major; and Stacy Barron from Plymouth, 
        Mass., in the Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra by Carl Maria von 
        Weber. The program opens with Reznicek's familiar Overture to Donna Diana, 
        and closes with Beethoven's beloved Sixth Symphony, known as the Pastorale, 
        with its sections written to represent a walk in the woods, a brook, a 
        peasant dance, a thunderstorm, and a shepherd's song.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Joy Marie Giguere has studied with Nancy Kilborn of Windham, 
        Maine, and is currently a student of David Maxwell of Scarborough, Maine. 
        An art history and anthropology double major, she plays tuba in the Bowdoin 
        Concert Band, the Midcoast Symphony Orchestra, and the Bowdoin Brass Quintet. 
        While Joy's musical talents have been widely showcased since her arrival 
        at Bowdoin, her performance this Sunday will be her first solo performance 
        on the piano in over two years. In regards to this accomplishment, Joy 
        said, "To be this featured is a great honor for any musician. The members 
        of the orchestra are very supportive, even if I make mistakes. No concerto 
        is easy, but the orchestra believes in me. When you play by yourself, 
        there is more artistic liberty, but when you play with a group, even though 
        you are being showcased, it is imperative to keep up with what everyone 
        else is doing; everyone has to give 100%." Joy has received additional 
        honors by being chosen to the Intercollegiate All New England Band that 
        meets at Boston University in April.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Stacy Barron has studied with Katherine Matasy at the New 
        England Conservatory of Music, and currently studies with Thomas Parchman 
        of the Portland Symphony Orchestra. She has played with the Massachusetts 
        Youth Wind Ensemble and the Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra. This 
        is Stacy's second year of involvement with the Midcoast Symphony Orchestra. 
        An environmental studies and biology double major with a minor in music, 
        Stacy has been playing the clarinet for ten years. This Sunday marks Stacy's 
        first solo performance of the piece, Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra 
        by Carl Maria von Weber. A concertino is slightly different than a concerto 
        in that while a concertino does have different movements, they are not 
        as firmly delineated. As a student at Plymouth North High School, Stacy 
        performed several clarinet solos, and performed with other groups in the 
        Boston area as well. Of her experience playing with the Midcoast Symphony 
        Orchestra, Stacy commented that, "This is a great opportunity to be able 
        to work with an entire orchestra and to be able to perform a solo piece. 
        There is a good dynamic in the group, and it is fun to play with them."<br>
