      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Admit it: At one point or another in our lives, we have 
        all been attracted to things we cannot have. Be they material possessions, 
        or more to the point, other people, the lure of the forbidden is an undeniable 
        part of everyday life. However, when this attraction becomes too strong 
        and the barrier between the out-of-reach and the attainable is crossed, 
        dire consequences can ensue.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The unwarranted result of such taboo breaking is addressed 
        on a highly personal level in the play Stop Kiss, a production of the 
        Department of Theater and Dance directed by Joan Sand, being performed 
        this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at 7:00 p.m. in the Wish Theater. 
        A superb cast stars in this deeply thought-provoking and edgy play, which 
        focuses on the relationship between two young women living in New York 
        City and an event that changes their lives profoundly.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We are first introduced to Callie (Gemma Saunders '01), a 
        New York-bred radio traffic reporter who is completely at home in the 
        city. She is slightly off-put at the prospect of having to introduce Sarah, 
        a friend of a friend from St. Louis, to the city and all of its dangers 
        and excitements, but once the two meet it becomes obvious that friendship 
        will soon follow. Sarah (Andrea Weeks '03), an elementary school teacher 
        leaving her doting family to teach in the Bronx, is determined to make 
        a place for herself in New York and branch out from St. Louis's familiar 
        settings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Although the two have had completely different experiences 
        and share little in the way of background, Callie and Sarah soon develop 
        a close friendship. They share stories of the men in their lives; of Callie's 
        friend George, whose role occasionally overlaps with that of a lover, 
        and Sarah's ex-boyfriend Peter, with whom she parted ways after a seven-year 
        relationship. Their personalities, too, are very distinct. Sarah, who 
        is devoting her life to helping children learn, has a clear idea of where 
        she wants to be in her life and career, as well as who she is. Callie, 
        on the other hand, is constantly "swerving," in the words of Sarah: she 
        has a hard time making up her mind about many things, including her job, 
        George, and how she feels about Sarah. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The story unfolds from the aftermath of the event that transpires 
        and through flashbacks to scenes from the past. After our introduction 
        to the characters, we are thrown into a scene from the present, in which 
        a detective is questioning Callie. She describes a terrifying attack on 
        herself and Sarah that sent the latter to the hospital in a state of unconsciousness. 
        What the audience does not find out for certain, however, until later 
        on in the play is the set of circumstances surrounding this traumatic 
        occurrence. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In essence, the situation boils down to this: Callie and 
        Sarah were attacked because they were seen kissing. Diana Son, award-winning 
        writer of Stop Kiss, explains: "…to others, they're lesbians. But in their 
        minds exists this whole web of emotions that they're alternately giving 
        in to and fighting against…Because the incident in the play happens to 
        women other people think of as 'straight,' I think it's more accessible 
        than if it happened to women living their lives as lesbians." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not this is true, the play is accessible for many 
        other reasons as well. The characters might as well be recent Bowdoin 
        graduates trying to make it in New York; the cast does an excellent job 
        of letting us into their minds and feelings. Sanders brings a vivacity 
        and liveliness to the role of conflicted Callie, and Weeks artfully portrays 
        Sarah and the subtle changes her psyche goes through as the play progresses.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Says Weeks of her involvement in this complex production, 
        "I really enjoyed working on the show. The cast is great and I have had 
        a wonderful time working with Joan…things have come together so quickly, 
        too." The supporting cast, including Max Leighton '01 as the caring George, 
        Jack Curtin '01 as Sarah's ex Peter, and Josh Wolfe '03 as the tough detective, 
        are an outstanding complement to the main characters and are crucial in 
        revealing the true sentiments of Callie and Sarah. This is truly a production 
        not to be missed. Tickets are free at the Smith Union info desk.</p>
