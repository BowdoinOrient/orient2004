      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This weekend, the Film Society is proud to present a group 
        of films all dealing with the state we call home (well, at least during 
        the school year). But for me, these films are particularly important. 
        If you are an attentive reader of Student Speak, you will remember that 
        your's truly hails from Waldoboro; a great little village just up Route 
        1. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; That's right friends, I'm a Maine Dawg and proud of it. Now, 
        not all of these films treat the Pine Tree State with great respect. But 
        that's OK - we can laugh at Maine every now and then. But all four films 
        are very enjoyable and should be seen by both residents and visitors alike. 
        The movies will be screened in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall, and are free 
        and open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Friday at 7:00 p.m. <br>
        <i>The</i> <i>Iron</i> <i>Giant</i> (1999) <br>
        Directed by: Brad Bird <br>
        Starring: Eli Marienthal, Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Van Diesel, Christopher McDonald, John Mahoney, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Cloris Leachman, M. Emmet Walsh <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There are so many reasons why you should see this incredible 
        movie. First off, look at the director. Does the name sound familiar? 
        Well, if you're a Simpsons fan, it should. Bird directed the famous "Krusty 
        Gets Busted" episode, plus the one where Krusty and his dad are reunited. 
        Now, as to the quality of the film work, it is top notch. The animation 
        is superb and truly beautiful. All the voices used are great. You don't 
        even associate them with the actors; they become the characters. Now, 
        as for the story, it is very moving. A giant robot from outer space lands 
        in a coastal Maine fishing village and befriends a boy with no friends. 
        This is 1957, so the government believes that the robot is a Russian weapon 
        and istrying to find it and destroy it. The film has been described as 
        an anti-anti-communism film, showing the horrors of the Red Scare, and 
        I'd have to agree with that description. The themes and emotions this 
        film brings about are very adult; don't think that just because it is 
        animated it is only for kids. Everyone should see this remarkable film. 
        It is simply amazing.<br>
        <b>Rated PG </b></p>
      <p>Friday at 9:00 p.m. <br>
        <i>Lake</i> <i>Placid</i> (1999) <br>
        Directed by: Steve Miner <br>
        Starring: Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Brendan Gleeson, Betty White <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; OK, this is believable. People start dying in a small town 
        in The County (that's Aroostook County for you non-Maine Dawgs) when a 
        giant crocodile gets hungry and starts to eat them. Absurd, completely 
        absurd. That is why when this film bombed at the theaters as a horror 
        film, it was marketed as a comedy for its video release. And a comedy 
        it is. I only watched a few minutes of it to prepare for this article, 
        but already I was laughing. Hearing a New York paleontologist try to get 
        out of going to Maine because she's "allergic to timber," is almost too 
        good to believe. And to think Bill Pullman is a game warden is downright 
        hilarious. I think everyone should see this movie for a good laugh. <br>
        <b>Rated R </b></p>
      <p>Saturday at 7:00 p.m. <br>
        <i>The</i> <i>Cider</i> <i>House</i> <i>Rules</i> (1999) <br>
        Directed by: Lasse Hallström <br>
        Starring: Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Delroy Lindo <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is the story of a boy raised in an orphanage in Maine 
        that also doubles as an abortion clinic. The doctor (Michael Caine's Oscar-winning 
        role) treats the boy as his own son and, if I remember correctly, encourages 
        him to go to his old school. A school we all know very well... I haven't 
        seen this film, so I don't have much else to say about it. John Irving 
        wrote it, so it is probably pretty good. And critics liked it, so that's 
        a plus. But, for no other reason, go to this movie because they talk about 
        Bowdoin in it. It will make you feel special, I promise. <br>
        <b>Rated PG-13 </b></p>
      <p>Saturday at 9:00 p.m. (or a little bit after it, Cider House is just 
        over 2 hours in length) <br>
        <i>The</i> <i>Man</i> <i>Without</i> <i>a</i> <i>Face</i> (1993)<br>
        Directed by: Mel Gibson <br>
        Starring: Mel Gibson, Nick Stahl, Margaret Wilson, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Richard Masur, Gabby Hoffman <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So this movie doesn't talk about Bowdoin, but that's OK, 
        because it was filmed here. Oh, how exciting! You can sit in the audience 
        and yell out, "Hey, that's Hubbard Hall!" (Of course, you'll sound dumb, 
        because everyone else will know its Hubbard; we all go here). It's kind 
        of funny to see Bowdoin as a military boarding school. In the film, a 
        young boy is desperate to get into this school and goes to a reclusive, 
        scarred former teacher to help him gain admittance. It's a fairly good 
        film on its own, but should be all the more enjoyable to us, the members 
        of the Bowdoin community. You might even catch a glimpse of one of your 
        professors; I know they are in the movie somewhere. <br>
        <b>Rated PG-13 </b></p>
