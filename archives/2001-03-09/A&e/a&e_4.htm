      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; To coincide with the chilly weather, the Arctic Museum has 
        invited John Terriak, a Labrador woodcarver of Arctic themes, to speak 
        about his art and to demonstrate his artistic talent this Saturday.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Terriak is a self-taught carver and an explorer of the Arctic 
        tradition; he is also a hunter and a traveler. While growing up Labrador, 
        Canada, he did not have a lot of toys and would make his own things out 
        of wood. After he grew up, Terriak took up carving professionally and 
        developed his skills through his travels, by attending workshops and just 
        looking at the world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Though people often ask him to carve a specific thing, most 
        of the time it is the material that inspires Terriak. Sometimes it is 
        vice versa - something he has seen would come out as an idea for a carving 
        and he would seek the right material for it; while he carves primarily 
        in soapstone, he has also tried labradorite, ivory, antler, whalebone, 
        and wood. Some of his pieces are human faces, others are the animals he 
        sees and hunts, especially whales and seals. Though carving is his main 
        medium, Terriak has also done drawings with pencil and ink and has created 
        jewelry from precious metals.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; John Terriak is now a resident of Nain, the northernmost 
        community on the Labrador coast. He was one of the two people to own a 
        dog team. He would make dog sleds and harnesses by himself, as well as 
        other hunting necessities - gun, game, bullet bags, parkas and harpoon 
        heads. Most of his crafts go to the local residents and tourists, though 
        some of his pieces are sold online and many of them have been exhibited 
        and won awards in Canada. Terriak himself has been on the board of the 
        Inuit Art Foundation and, in 1991, was commissioned by the Government 
        of Newfoundland and Labrador to produce the carvings to be presented to 
        four Eastern and six New England governors at a conference in St. John's. 
        His two sons, his wife and bother are carvers as well.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; These days, Terriak has substituted his dog team with a scooter. 
        Other possibly disappointing news is that on Friday and Saturday, Brunswick 
        is expecting a new blow of The Blizzard. This probably would not be a 
        problem for Terriak, but would be a difficulty for the children that are 
        expected to come to the show. They will have the opportunity to explore 
        clay and painting while Terriak is talking about his work. There will 
        also be a Bowdoin student reading Arctic stories to the children throughout 
        the event. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Orient was unable to get hold of Terriak 
        himself, as he is currently en route to Bowdoin. However, he will be in 
        the Arctic Museum on Saturday at 11 a.m. for those who are dying to meet 
        this man and see his craft. Since I have always wanted to meet a carver, 
        hunter, dog team owner, Labradorean and traveler in one, I will definitely 
        be there.</p>
