      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; $7.98. That was the two-day late fee I had to pay for last 
        week's Python. Like there were that many people out there who were clambering 
        to rent the damn thing over the two days I forgot to bring it back. I 
        asked the girl behind the counter if she could waive the late fee, and 
        she said that their computers won't let them do that anymore. Anymore.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This week's film is Freedom Strike, starring Michael Dudikoff 
        and Tone Loc. Yes, you read correctly, Tone Loc, who was famous for songs 
        such as "Funky Cold Medina" and "Wild Thing", while not so famous for 
        his more recent musical work, such as Funky "Cold Medina y2k", and "Wild 
        Thing y2k." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What's funny is that you think I'm kidding. Tone Loc was 
        given second billing on the box to Freedom Strike, but unfortunately he 
        appeared in the film for all of 15 minutes. But, boy, I tell you, those 
        were the most riveting 15 minutes of my life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Dudikoff plays Tom Dickson, leader of a covert Naval 
        strike force known as Freedom Strike. He says the phrase "green light" 
        a lot, whenever his team has been given permission to do something. The 
        Syrians have developed a chip that blocks all communications and targeting 
        signals from the U.S. Freedom Strike's first assignment is to sneak into 
        a Syrian military compound, hidden inside a heavily guarded mausoleum, 
        and steal the chip. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While Freedom Strike makes its way towards the target, the 
        Navy sends out a squadron of F-14 Tomcats to create a diversion, allowing 
        for some really corny dogfight dialogue, in which they call enemy planes 
        "bandits." While the fly boys in the sky are saying things like, "He's 
        on my tail," and "Come on you bastard," and "I got him. I'm going for 
        missile lock," Freedom Strike is shooting lots of Syrians with their automatic 
        weapons. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Lucky for them, the Syrians are wearing lots of blood packs, 
        so when they get "hit" by bullets, lots of red liquid bursts out from 
        the inside of their clothing, while they shake their body wildly and convulse 
        on the ground. It helps if they make a sound like, "Yaarghraa!" while 
        firing their AK-47's into the sky.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom Strike fulfils itsobjective and removes the chip 
        from one of the Syrian computers, but upon their escape, Dickson's best 
        bud is shot and killed. He was wearing lots of blood packs too. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom Strike's next mission is to serve on a Naval aircraft 
        carrier for three months while the peace treaty between Syria and some 
        other nations goes through. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; One of the members of Freedom Strike says to the Admiral 
        on board the carrier, "With all due respect, sir, I don't see how a piece 
        of paper written by us is going to bring an end to a holy war that's been 
        raging for two thousand years." The music swells and the admiral looks 
        off into the distance and says, "You may be right, but somebody has to 
        start the ball rolling. This is the first step. Who knows, maybe the rest 
        will be a little less difficult." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On board the carrier, Dickson is introduced to Tone Loc who 
        is assigned to replace the dead guy who used to serve with Freedom Strike. 
        The president of the United States arrives on board, as well as a reporter 
        from ZNN, in order to witness the signing of the treaty. The president 
        gives a speech, but a Syrian camera man attempts to kill him with a gun 
        that looks like a pen. He misses, and instead shoots the Syrian president.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Syria gets all grumpy and some crazed revolutionary named 
        Colonel Abdul Raman secretly highjacks a UN weapons facility in Syria 
        and plans to nuke Europe. Luckily, the American president finds out. Abdul 
        calls the president and blames him for the failure of the peace treaty. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The president asks him about the take-over of the weapons 
        facility. "Weapons facility, I uh know nothing of what you speak of," 
        Abdul says. He's calling from the weapons facility he's just highjacked. 
        I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dickson volunteers his strike team to invade the weapons 
        facility and disarm the nukes. If they don't succeed in time, Naval F-14's 
        will bomb them, which would mean more crappy dogfight dialogue. Freedom 
        Strike sneaks into the facility and shoots more Syrians. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The sexy female computer expert hacks her way into the system 
        and attempts to shut down the launch sequence.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "How's it going?" Dickson asks her as she types furiously. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "O.K."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Is it working?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Dammit, we don't have much time here!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you want me to stop and explain this to you, or do you 
        want me to disarm the thermonuclear missiles?" she asks.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the nukes have been disarmed, and Dickson and 
        the sexy computer girl run to the rendezvous point. They get stopped by 
        Colonel Abdul Raman who tries to kill them, but Dickson ends up rolling 
        around with him and punching him. Dickson shoots him in the stomach and 
        backs away. The dying Raman says, "This is for you,' and hands Dickson 
        a grenade pin. Dickson looks at it with confusion. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Tone Loc rescues a bunch of hostages, uttering 
        forth some of his only lines for the whole film, "C'mon. C'mon. C'mon. 
        S'go. S'go." Slight pause. "C'mon." Then he shoots a bunch of Syrians 
        and escapes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly it dawns on him that the pin was pulled from a grenade 
        on Raman's own jacket. Yeah, I saw Raising Arizona too. "Run!' he shouts, 
        barely getting away as the evil Syrian explodes. The End. Grade: C. Join 
        me here next week when I review Angel Fist about female kick-boxing in 
        the Philippines. Yes!</p>
