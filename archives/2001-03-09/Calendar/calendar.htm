                    The Student Government is sponsoring a forum on the House 
                    System. There will be a discussion of several aspects of the 
                    house system, such as what's working, what needs improvement, 
                    and any new ideas that anyone might have. <br>

                    The Religion Department is sponsoring this seminar on Jung. 
                    I can't really say what they will talk about, but I am certain 
                    that they will say Jung a lot, which automatically makes it 
                    a guaranteed fun time. <br>
