      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playoffs started on a good note for the men's hockey 
        team last weekend. They dealt fourth-seeded Trinity (15-7-2) a 4-3 overtime 
        loss on Saturday, and advanced to today's 4:00 semifinal against second 
        seed Amherst (17-4-3). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Coach Terry Meagher said that Saturday's game was 
        pretty exciting. "It was one of the all-time greatest games I've been 
        associated with here," he said. "It wasclassic college hockey." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trinity's Steven LaBrie netted the game's first two 
        goals. Mike Carosi '02 and captain Alex Tatum '01 assisted first-year 
        Chris Pelletier on a power play goal three minutes after LaBrie's second, 
        and the deficit was reduced to 2-1. Thirty-five seconds into the second 
        period, Carosi took passes from Pelletier and Jared Porter '03 to tie 
        the score. Mark Colwell of Trinity put one past senior goaltender Colin 
        Robinson about seven minutes into the third frame, but was answered by 
        Pelletier, who bagged a short-handed goal off a pass from senior Mike 
        O'Leary. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tatum said the team kept its intensity flowing into 
        the overtime period. "We wanted to make sure we came out with the same 
        focus," he said. "Everyone understood the fact that if we didn't go out 
        ready, we wouldn't be playing the next week." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 17 minutes of overtime play, Carosi netted the 
        game-winning goal off a feed from Pelletier. Carosi said that some serious 
        teamwork produced the victory. "We had everyone going, in goal, the forwards, 
        and the defense," he said. "It was a complete team effort."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson made 37 saves in the victory, and Meagher asserted 
        his importance in the net. "Colin played very well; you have to have solid 
        goaltending to advance in the playoffs," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher also cited Brian Shuman '02, Chad Hart '03, 
        and Ryan Seymour '03 for their defensive efforts. "Ryan being out there 
        gave the team a lift," he said. "And Alex played his usual game. He always 
        plays hard, gives 100 percent each day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone paid attention to their responsibilities; 
        the team pulled hard for each other, and it was a collective effort," 
        Coach Meagher said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middlebury (21-2-1), as the top seed in the tournament, 
        earned a first-round bye. The Panthers also host the semifinal and championship 
        games at Chip Kenyon '85 Arena this weekend. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin/Amherst semifinal winner will face either 
        Middlebury or Hamilton (11-12-1) in the NESCAC championship game tomorrow 
        at 7:00. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference title comes with a spot in the NCAA Division 
        III tournament, but Coach Meagher indicated that his team isn't thinking 
        about national competition just yet. "We'll focus on some of the things 
        we'll see from them, but all year we've been trying to have systems that 
        adapt to different opponents," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amherst shut out seventh-seeded Williams 3-0 last weekend 
        to advance to the semifinals. The Jeffs defeated Bowdoin by a score of 
        6-1 a Feb. 9th regular-season matchup. "We felt we didn't have our 'A-game' 
        on that one, but they played very well," said Coach Meagher. "In this 
        division, it's a rare second opportunity to meet them again." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In terms of Amherst this Friday, we are looking forward 
        to the chance of playing them again," Tatum said. "We know that we didn't 
        play our best game the last time. We have proved that we can play with 
        the best teams in the league when we play our style of hockey." </p>
