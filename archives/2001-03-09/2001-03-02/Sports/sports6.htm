      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing 6'9" tall, weighing 270 lbs, and wearing a 
        size 18 shoe, Dave Baranowski is by no means a small man. If his dimensions 
        alone have not convinced you of this seemingly incontrovertible fact, 
        merely confer with opposing NESCAC centers, who have had to cope with 
        Baranowski's immense proportions over the better part of the last four 
        basketball seasons. To be sure, much of these rival players and coaches 
        are relieved that they will no longer have to contend with Bowdoin's all-time 
        leader in blocked shots and field goal percentage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranowski's meteoric rise to NESCAC stardom did not 
        happen overnight. In fact, the Souhegan High School (Amherst, NH) star 
        was relegated to the bench for much of his freshmen year before exploding 
        onto the scene for an NCAA tournament-bound Bowdoin squad the following 
        year. During his sophomore campaign, the burly center came out of nowhere 
        to shatter the single season Polar Bear record with 67 blocks (a record 
        that would fall a mere year later, when Baranowski swatted away 69 shots). 
        He also shot an impressive 61 percent from the floor, while notching 11 
        points and 5.5 rebounds per game.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranowski followed up his breakout sophomore season 
        with two more years of steady and marked improvement. Over the past two 
        seasons, he has continued to increase both his offensive and defensive 
        production enroute to garnering back-to-back 2nd Team All-NESCAC honors. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 2000-2001 campaign that has just concluded, Baranowski 
        averaged 14 points and 8 rebounds per game (both team highs). He also 
        led the team (and finished second in the nation, in fact) in field goal 
        percentage, connecting at a very impressive 65 percent clip. However, 
        in reality, it is impossible to measure Baranowski's contributions to 
        Bowdoin basketball by statistics alone. Over the past few seasons, he 
        has admirably carried the burden of being Bowdoin's proverbial go-to guy, 
        and has invariably been forced to fight through double and even triple 
        teams in the post. Coach Tim Gilbride offered the following about Baranowski's 
        irreplaceable presence on the team: "Dave worked extremely hard during 
        his tenure at Bowdoin and developed into one of the best big men in our 
        conference. He certainly played a key role in our success. More importantly 
        though, Dave is a friendly and kind-hearted person who never has a bad 
        word to say about anyone. His personality and work ethic will lead him 
        to many successes in life."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranowski credits his improvement this season to the 
        valuable experience he gained playing in the Boston Beanpot League this 
        past summer. The league contained Division I superstars such as Boston 
        College's Troy Bell and even a smattering of NBA hoopsters (including 
        the ill-fated Dana Barros and the once-legendary Billy Curley). As for 
        future plans, Baranowski-an economics major with a minor in government-is 
        not quite ready to call it quits with his basketball career. "I'd really 
        like to give playing in Europe a shot," he claims. "Being able to hold 
        my own against top notch competition this summer made me believe that 
        I may have a future playing basketball at the professional level."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Off the court, Baranowski participates in Bears and 
        Cubs and regularly works with youngsters from the nearby Brunswick Junior 
        High. Though women and children tend to shriek in terror when they first 
        encounter Baranowski's gargantuan frame, those who know him personally-as 
        Coach Gilbride intimated-find that he is actually quite a pleasant and 
        affable fellow. </p>
