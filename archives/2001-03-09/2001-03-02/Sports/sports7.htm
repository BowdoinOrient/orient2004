      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most athletes are beginning their spring season, 
        the women's indoor track team is still finishing their championship meets. 
        This weekend the season will conclude for the women at ECAC's held at 
        Boston University.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women have competed strongly all season, but the 
        high expectations they had set for the New England Division III meet were 
        not fulfilled. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the eleventh place finish out of the twenty-two 
        teams in the competition is not a just representation of the effort made 
        at this meet. Battling crowded heats with each runner vying for a lead 
        position at any and all costs, throwing elbows when need be, our Bowdoin 
        women demonstrated a passion for their sport by overcoming these obstacles 
        as well as displaying good sportsmanship.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some highlights of the New England Division III meet 
        held at Brandeis on February 17th include Julia Febiger '03 and Shaina 
        Zamitis's '02 6th and 10th place finish in the 600m. As for the jumping 
        events Casey Kelley '02 triple jumped 34'09" to a 5th place finish and 
        Acadia Senese '03 placed 10th with a jump of 33'08". Meka Decyk '02 placed 
        7th in the pole vault with a vault of 9'6". <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most notable performances of the day were 
        the relay teams. The distance medley run by Jesse Gray '01, Libby Barney 
        '03, Jane Cullina'03 and Julia Febiger '03 placed seventh in the meet. 
        The 4x400m relay placed fifth. The 4x200m relay run by Sara Bodnar '03, 
        Kat Martens '04, Andrea Weeks '03 and Kristin Dummer '04 and the 4x800m 
        relay run by Lynne Davies '04, Jane Cullina '04, Bre-Anne MacKenna '03 
        and Libby Barney '03 both placed third overall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women also ran faster relay times the next weekend 
        at Open New Englands. This meet was last Friday night and Saturday night 
        hosted at Tufts University. The distance medley relay kicked off Friday 
        evening with a 1200m run by Bre-Anne MacKenna, followed by an outstanding 
        400m by Julia Febiger, handed off to Jane Cullina for an 800m and then 
        finished with a personal best mile run by Libby Barney. The women cut 
        ten seconds off their time from the New England DIII performance.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late Saturday afternoon the women were back again for 
        the 4x800m relay, run by Davies, MacKenna, Cullina and Barney. Both Barney 
        and MacKenna ran very strong races to put the team ahead of Wheaton, Tufts, 
        Conn College, Colby, MIT and Northeastern. The team is looking forward 
        to a solid showing at BU this weekend. </p>
