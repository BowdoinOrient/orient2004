      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weekends ago the women's 
      squash team competes in Nationals, held at Yale University in hopes of beating 
      Williams to win the B flight for the second year in a row. It was frustrating 
      being in the B flight after Bowdoin beat Dartmouth and had been so close 
      with Brown and Cornell, all of which were in the A flight. Bowdoin simply 
      resolved to win their own division then. The women were hungry for revenge 
      after losing to Williams earlier in the season 7-2. Unfortunately, the women 
      were in for disappointment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin was ranked #10 in the nation and were seeded #2 
      going into the tournament. We played St. Lawrence in the first round, which 
      we won handily 9-0. Next up was Colby, who was slightly tougher, but did 
      not pose too much challenge and everyone from Bowdoin won their match. The 
      women knew that the hard part was coming in the finals. For the third year 
      in a row we would be playing Williams for the championship.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday they went into our matches pumped and excited 
      to settle the score. Everyone was in the zone visualizing and listening 
      to music to get mentally ready. This would be the last team match for the 
      five seniors. Today was not going to be their day though.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophomore Merrill Muckerman '03 brought in the first win 
      after a hard match; her individual games were close in score, but she ended 
      up winning 3-0. Liz Steffey '01, who has been rocking the Casba this season 
      by winning all of her matches except for Trinity, then brought in the next 
      win. She also had a tough match, but dominated and won 3-1. Meanwhile, on 
      the other courts, Lindy Stanley '03 just lost to her opponent, and Laura 
      Inkeles '01 was struggling in her match. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times it looked as if Laura was going to come back 
      and take the match, but she finally lost in four. Leila "Ali" Mountain '02 
      hit her stride after studying abroad this fall at just the right time. She 
      also had a tough match, but managed to pull it out in three. As always, 
      my roommate Dana "You better not be using my shampoo" Betts showed us why 
      she is an All- American and easily won her match 3-0. At this point Kate 
      Lubin '01 lost her match, and Cristin O'Brien '02 was down 1-2 in a very 
      close match. The Williams opponent was up in the fourth game, but Cristin 
      came back to win that game in a tie breaker. Cristin played her heart out, 
      but ended up losing in a tie breaker in the fifth game. The teams were tied 
      4-4 in games and Anne Stevenson '01 had yet to play. Unfortunately, Anne 
      had been sick that weekend and was bedridden all Saturday. Even so, she 
      came out strong and won the first two games without much difficulty. It 
      looked as if Anne had it in the bag, but after the first two games, her 
      body gave way and she could not maintain the same level of intensity. In 
      the next three games, the Williams opponent dominated and ended up stealing 
      the match 3-2 to win the championship 5-4.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin women were really disappointed because the 
      championship was almost in their grasp, but also content because they had 
      accomplished so much this season. Co-captain Dana Betts '01 reflected, "We 
      went out there with a strong, determined attitude and played our hearts 
      out. Everyone, especially the seniors, really wanted the championship and 
      even though we lost, I was really impressed with everyone's effort and improvement 
      over the season." Beating Dartmouth and losing just 5-4 to Brown and Cornell 
      is the best that the women's squash team has ever done here and that is 
      something to be proud of. This team is losing a lot of seniors who have 
      carried the team through the past four years. It is going to be a rocky 
      road ahead for women's squash, but we are confident that Coach Fortson will 
      bring the team through with style. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weekend Dana Betts, Liz Steffey, Jamie Shea, and 
      Wasif Khan will be competing in the Individuals at Harvard. <!-- #EndEditable -->
