      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was home for winter break, I made money by selling 
        Christmas trees at a small local grocery store. Having worked there for 
        a number of years, I was quite accustomed to helping the customers pick 
        out trees, wrapping them up, and tying them on cars. After a few slow 
        days due to freezing rain, we were quite busy on December 23. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Early into my shift, I noticed a man about 60 and his son 
        browsing and went over to assist them. As I grew closer I could hear the 
        man cursing the tree out for being too short and ugly, and using the f-word 
        about every third breath. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Quite disenchanted by people who were rude and chose to verbally 
        take their frusterations out on me, and generally fed up with my dosage 
        of over-work and low pay, I stopped him mid-f-bomb, asked him please not 
        to use such language, and told him that he had no right talking to me 
        like that. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After repeatedly asking him to do so, he got up in my face 
        and as he brushed up against me, said things such as "You're messin' with 
        the wrong kid," and "What the f***'s your problem?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I shook his hand and tried to calm him down. As he backed 
        away, trying desperately to keep his lip still, he yelled, "My wife died 
        of cancer. She's been dead a year now." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This catharsis triggered something in me. As tears welled 
        up in my eyes, I told him about my friend Doug who had been run over by 
        a train in July of 1999. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It had been a while since I cried about Doug's death. After 
        talking to this man, Joe, while helping him pick out his tree, it occurred 
        to me that he had been dwelling on a bitterness in his heart for quite 
        some time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He told me of his daughter, who graduated from Natick High 
        School with me in 1998, and how she had been somewhat lost since. After 
        reflecting upon the situation and many others speeding by over vacation, 
        I came to a sort of peace.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A non-stop roller-coaster ride with painful lows and marvelous 
        sweet highs, 2000 was hard on me. I didn't have a real chance to stop 
        and think about this until it was over, and I realized what was most important 
        to me: family and friends. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As life tugs at me in several different directions, I have 
        always been able to keep a sense of humor about things. This is certainly 
        due in part to the people who have left their individual mark on me. To 
        those of you here at Bowdoin: thanks. </p>
