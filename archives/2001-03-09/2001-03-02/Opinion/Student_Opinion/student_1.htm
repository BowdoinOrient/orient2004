      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Having just returned from a vacation (desperately needed 
        but too short), I am fully prepared to tackle yet another human interest 
        item that affects the lives of Bowdoin students campuswide. This issue 
        is relevant whether you live in the Tower, out in Harpswell, or in one 
        of the condemned fraternity buildings. I am talking, of course, about 
        that detestable segment of the population known as...really bad drivers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I chose - unwisely enough - to drive from my town in Connecticut 
        to Bowdoin last Sunday. Anyone who was on campus last Sunday knows that, 
        for the most part, the day's weather consisted of snow, sleet, and freezing 
        rain, and that travel conditions were horrible. My usual four-and-a-half 
        hour drive home a week earlier had taken me over seven hours because of 
        an accident on the New Hampshire turnpike, so I was looking forward to 
        the return trip being a little more reasonable.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Boy, was I wrong.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It was snowing when I got up, so I was sure that I would 
        encounter few difficulties on the road. However, the minute I entered 
        the Mass Pike, I knew that I was in for a rather unpleasant surprise. 
        For within only a few miles of the Pike's entrance, I saw my first of 
        several accidents: a Ford Explorer had careened off a guardrail and had 
        landed in a ditch.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, before you Explorer owners get all huffy, let me make 
        something clear: not all Explorer owners are really bad drivers. In fact, 
        I had just spent the week with my friends Jane and John who own an Explorer 
        that they've nicknamed "Patton." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of all the Explorers I have ever known, Patton is the finest. 
        He explores the highways and byways of downtown Kihei with ease and grace, 
        and you can almost hear him apologizing when Jane has to take out a second 
        mortgage in order to buy a tank of gas. (Patton likes to eat a lot of 
        gas, and gas in Hawaii is expensive.) Jane is a great driver, and she 
        is careful to give Patton all of the love and care he needs in order for 
        him to live a healthy, safe life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the drivers between Connecticut and 
        Maine last Sunday were much less compassionate toward their Explorers. 
        Of the 14 accidents I saw, seven of them involved Ford Explorers. The 
        Mass Pike, 495 North, 95 North, and 295 North were virtual Ford Explorer 
        burial grounds.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'll be the first to admit that, when I'm riding in an Explorer 
        (or, for that matter, in any SUV), I feel like I'm the king of the world. 
        It's great to be sitting so high up on the road, master (or mistress) 
        of one's domain. There's a certain power that comes from driving an SUV 
        that can't be had anywhere else.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When I'm piloting my Jetta down a highway in the sleet, snow, 
        and rain, with Explorers passing me on the right, however, I feel very 
        differently. The State of Maine made it perfectly clear that the reduced 
        speed limit was "45," and yet there were SUVs passing me as if I was standing 
        still. This kind of driving is very unsafe. These people were really bad 
        drivers because they thought that their Explorers could save them from 
        an accident. This simply wasn't so.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I see an accident on the highway, I shiver, and 
        these crashed Explorers were no exception. I saw one in New Hampshire 
        that had flipped on its side. I saw one outside of Andover, Massachusetts 
        that had had its entire passenger side destroyed as it got ripped down 
        a guardrail. I saw one that had almost careened across the median. There 
        were ambulances and police cars all around. It was a truly frightening 
        sight.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, I couldn't help but wonder, as I crawled by, Jetta 
        in third gear, radio turned off: would a little common sense have saved 
        these really bad drivers? Would the simple understanding that a big car 
        does not equal invulnerability have slowed them down? Could these accidents 
        have been prevented? Were these really bad drivers in fact lulled into 
        the false sense of security that comes from 16" Firestone tires, 5,000 
        pounds of steel, anti-lock brakes, four-wheel drive, and Eddie Bauer seats?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps they were. Perhaps there is a lesson somewhere for 
        those of us who feel invincible on the highway. Whatever the answer, though, 
        I'm just glad I made it home.</p>
