      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the last eight years, I have observed Democrats 
        blindly defend the personal indiscretions of former-President Bill Clinton. 
        And, for the first time in the history of presidential politics, a strange 
        dichotomy has existed, in which people have managed to separate their 
        dislike of Clinton's personal flaws with their approval of his job performance, 
        especially in relation to the effectiveness of his economic policies. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, with the ongoing bipartisan scrutiny over several of 
        his eleventh-hour pardon decisions-decisions which account for his ability 
        to perform the tasks necessary of him as president-the unprecedented dichotomy 
        that once characterized Clinton's presidency has dissipated, and an almost 
        universal disapproval of both his public and private life has emerged.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the latest CNN Gallup Poll, Clinton accumulated a 55 percent 
        disapproval rating -the highest negative rating he has ever received in 
        that specific poll. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, since the furor over the Clinton pardons has 
        taken center stage in most media outlets, President Bush has benefited, 
        with a change of fortune in most national polls. After the ever-divisive 
        2000 Presidential Election, 44 percent of the population had a negative 
        impression of their newly elected president. Now, however, 57 percent 
        of Americans credit him with doing a good job.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, Bush has received a gracious honeymoon period that 
        many thought might never come in light of the questions pertaining to 
        the legitimacy of the election. And the media's obsession with the Clinton 
        pardons has made it nearly impossible to have a meaningful discussion 
        on the several policy initiatives that Bush has proposed since he took 
        office in late January. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; That said, though, Clinton's abuse of the pardon privilege 
        may have some serious, lasting ramifications for him as well as the Democratic 
        Party. A man who continuously proved he was able to side step investigation 
        after investigation is finding that it is much more difficult to strike 
        up public approval or change public opinion without the power of the White 
        House and the Justice department coming to his aide. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, we are currently one year and eight months 
        away from a mid-term election that will decide which party has control 
        of the Senate, and possibly all of Congress, though the democrats would 
        need to make substantial gains in the House of Representatives for that 
        to happen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The normal pattern of voting behavior in mid-term elections 
        is that the party in control of the White House loses seats in Congress, 
        thus showing Americans' preference for a split government. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, by no means is this guaranteed, and, in fact, the 
        last time a divergence from this typical happening took place, the highly 
        controversial nature of Bill Clinton played an intricate part: I am referring 
        to, of course, impeachment and the 1998 elections, when Democrats managed 
        to pick up seats after Republicans overplayed their hand on the Monica 
        Lewinsky scandal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This time, however, Clinton may have the reverse effect on 
        his party's chances in 2002, as the criticism he is receiving over the 
        pardons is coming from both sides of the isle.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After eight years of Clinton, public skepticism of politics 
        is at possibly an unparalleled high. And, according to a Fox News Opinion 
        Dynamics Poll, more people believe the United States to be moving in the 
        wrong direction now, as opposed to when he took office a mere eight years 
        ago. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, it looks like we are unfortunately going to spend 
        the next four years like we spent the last eight-talking about Bill Clinton. 
        It is highly conceivable that this is exactly what he wanted. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I myself did not expect anything less from a man who showed 
        a lack of shame time and time again while serving his two terms in the 
        Oval Office. Still, I was hoping that these four years would provide a 
        forum for conservatives to address the issues that they hold dear. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Then again, Bill Clinton transcends all issues, anyway. And 
        the reason we keep talking about him seems relatively clear: We simply 
        want an integrity in our leaders that we so richly deserve.</p>
