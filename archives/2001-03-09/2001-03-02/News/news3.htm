      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of Monday, February 19, Bowdoin's gateway 
        to the Internet was once again filling to the brim with traffic. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students arrived on campus in late January for 
        the beginning of the term, Internet access had intensified as hundreds 
        of web browsers, e-mail applications, and Napster clients on campus were 
        restarted. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Valentine's Day, however, the pattern of use had 
        shifted; outgoing Internet activity-computers around the world requesting 
        web pages, e-mails, and mp3s from Bowdoin's network-was roaring, while 
        data coming into Bowdoin from the Internet were slowing down.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was bad news for campus computer users. As the 
        Student Computing Committee (SCC) put it in an all-students e-mail later 
        that day, "Our bandwidth has evaporated because people are downloading 
        music FROM our computers, and the only thing we get in return for this 
        is a very slow Internet connection."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCC recommended that Bowdoin's Napster users alter 
        their settings to make their personal collections of music files unavailable 
        to the rest of the world, essentially raising a one-way electronic drawbridge. 
        The ability to receive files from off-campus computers would not be affected. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the SCC advised Computing and Information 
        Services (CIS) to test technical solutions to the problem, including deliberately 
        limiting the size of the "pipe" feeding Napster-specific data from Bowdoin 
        to other computers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts seem to have been successful. Public statistics 
        on Bowdoin's Internet use at <a href="http://noc.bowdoin.edu/stats/wans_idx.html">http://noc.bowdoin.edu/stats/wans_idx.html</a> 
        showed that the next day witnessed a sharp drop in external Internet access 
        to Bowdoin's servers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on Tuesday February 27, while testing solutions, 
        CIS turned off the rate-limiting measures to gauge the staying power of 
        Bowdoin's treatment for Napster addiction. By 2:00 p.m., the outgoing 
        Internet traffic peaked; it did not decline until after midnight, and 
        peaked again 14 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened this month, when access to Bowdoin's information 
        networks became so tempting to computer users around the world, was an 
        unusually clear example of an issue that has befuddled educational institutions 
        around the country. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both large universities and small colleges that make 
        it a point to provide universal high-speed Internet access to their students 
        are frustrated by the way their bandwidth evaporates' into music- and 
        video-swapping technologies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Meyers '02, chair of the Student Computing Committee, 
        pointed out that "we have a very fast Internet connection... Bowdoin is 
        rated in the top ten schools in the US in terms of bandwidth per student." 
        But one or two computers transferring large files quickly-which technologies 
        like Napster facilitate-is still enough to bring Internet connections 
        like Bowdoin's to a standstill, and the result is frustratingly sluggish 
        access.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If schools try to solve the problem by expanding the 
        pipe and paying handsomely for faster Internet connections, as Bowdoin 
        has done, they find that the demand for bandwidth will often rise just 
        as fast as the supply. At Bowdoin, "the first-year dorms tend to be the 
        largest users of bandwidth," Meyers said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College is now exploring other ways to stem departing 
        Napster traffic, which, if successful, will make Internet access on campus 
        faster-including speedier Napster downloads to students' computers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCC's current concern has nothing to do with Napster's 
        recent legal troubles, although the company is losing a suit brought by 
        the Recording Industry Association of America. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bowdoin has been very generous with Napster," Meyers 
        noted. "Whether you believe Napster violates copyright or not, there's 
        a technical problem to deal with."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent solutions will be discussed at the next Information 
        Technology Committee meeting in March. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meyers said that a comprehensive bandwidth policy, detailing 
        the amount of control Bowdoin will exercise over its Internet link, is 
        not far off. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E-mail response [to the SCC e-mail] was wonderful," 
        Meyers said, but "the actual technical response"-how many Napster users 
        actually made their files inaccessible to others-"is hard to judge." </p>
