        Security: Beware of burglary</b></font><!-- #EndEditable --></b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Burglary Prevention Council, burglars 
        break into a house, apartment, or condominium every 11 seconds. Nationwide, 
        there are about 2.5 million burglaries each year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some good news, though, is that traditionally, February 
        has the fewest number of burglaries reported, with July carrying the honor 
        of having the most. This is not surprising, given that many Americans 
        go on vacation in July.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of creating a false sense of security, the 
        Northeast usually has the fewest number of reported burglaries. However, 
        if you happen to be one of the unfortunate victims of a burglary, these 
        statistics provide little comfort.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can you reduce the chance that you will be a 
        victim of a burglary? Nine out of ten burglaries can be categorized as 
        preventable. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your risk can be greatly reduced by taking simple steps 
        to make your dorm or apartment more difficult to enter and less enticing 
        to would-be burglars.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest weapons in preventing burglaries are light, 
        time and noise.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light: If you notice that the lights around your apartment 
        or dorm are broken or do not work, call in a work order to facilities 
        (x3333). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you notice trees or shrubs are overgrown, report 
        this to facilities and request that they be trimmed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you live in an off campus apartment, tell your landlord 
        when lights do not work or shrubbery needs to be trimmed. You don't want 
        burglars to be able to hide easily in the shadows.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time: Make it time-consuming for a burglar to enter 
        your apartment or dorm. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not prop doors open or leave them unlocked. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have locks on the windows, use them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the locks on your doors or windows are broken, report 
        them to the facilities work order number.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise: If you hear someone trying to break into your 
        dorm or apartment, make noise and call Security right away. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also purchase several types of portable alarms 
        that you can hang on a doorknob and that will sound a loud alarm if someone 
        tries to enter your room.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other precautions you can take in the 
        event that a burglar does break into your dorm or apartment. Make a list 
        of all your belongings (keep receipts for expensive items). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep a copy of this list in a safety deposit box or 
        with a friend. This is also a good idea in case of a fire.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Photograph or videotape your property. Engrave your 
        valuables. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can loan you an engraver in Security. You can engrave 
        your Social Security Number or license number on your property. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be a deterrent to the burglar and also may 
        help in the recovery of your items if they are stolen. Security has a 
        one-page form used in the Operation ID program that can be used.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check with your (or your parents') insurance company 
        to make sure that you have adequate coverage for your valuables while 
        you are away at school. </p>
