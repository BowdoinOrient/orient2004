      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovations of both Ladd House (the former Chi Delta 
        Phi House) and the Theta Delta Chi House (TD) will commence within the 
        next month and are expected to be completed in time to house students 
        this fall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TD, located at 244 Maine Street, will eventually be 
        affiliated with Maine Hall and be renamed. Ladd House, located at 14 College 
        Street, will be affiliated with Winthrop Hall. During the summer, Ladd 
        House will also be the home of the Upward Bound program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Essentially, every house will be completely renovated 
        to college-life residential standards," said Vice President for Planning 
        and Development William Torrey. "[The College] will equip the houses with 
        large social spaces, in addition to the normal living rooms, dining rooms, 
        and libraries."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the renovations Torrey cited were the expansion 
        of the common space living areas and the addition of new furniture and 
        woodwork. In addition, elevators will be installed in both houses, allowing 
        for full handicap access. Both houses will also undergo extensive external 
        renovations.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladd House will also be equipped with new kitchen facilities, 
        including two kitchens: one for student use and one for Dining Service 
        use for special events. The estimated cost of these renovations is $1.9 
        million per house. Renovations to both houses are scheduled to be completed 
        in time for the fall 2001 semester. At that time, residents formerly affiliated 
        with Burnett House (students who lived in Winthrop Hall) will be able 
        to live in Ladd House. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, due to planned renovations to Howell House, 
        Howell affiliates (students who lived in Hyde) will move into TD for the 
        fall semester. After the Howell renovations are completed by the spring 
        of 2002, affiliates of Helmreich House (students who lived in Maine Hall) 
        will be able to take up permanent residence at TD.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If renovations remain on schedule, physical construction 
        will begin on TD within two weeks and on Ladd House in one month. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torrey said, "So far, everything's been on schedule, 
        and we plan on keeping it that way to have these houses ready by next 
        year." </p>
