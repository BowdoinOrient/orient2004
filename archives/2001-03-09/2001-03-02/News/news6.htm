      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first week of spring break, the Office of 
        Alumni Career Programs, the Career Planning Center, Alumni Relations, 
        and the Bowdoin Clubs of Boston and New York will be co-sponsoring a series 
        of site visits at the workplaces of various Bowdoin alumni in Boston and 
        New York. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This series of events, called "Thinking Outside the 
        Bubble," will take place from March 19-21. With the creation of the new 
        Office of Alumni Career Programs last August, programs of this type, which 
        are now in their fourth year, have the potential to become annual offerings 
        that will impact an even broader spectrum of the student population.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each visit is designed to provide a "hands-on" introduction 
        to a specific career field or industry; there will also be a networking 
        reception and panel discussion that will be held in each city to help 
        students make valuable contacts with Bowdoin alums. The fee for each reception 
        is $10.00; participation in site visits is free of charge.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lisa Tessler, director of Alumni Career Programs, describes 
        the purpose of the events as follows: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The primary goal of the site visits is to bring students 
        in close contact with an outstanding group of alumni in Boston and New 
        York who are willing to share their knowledge and expertise for the benefit 
        of students at their places of work. The alums will endeavor to provide 
        students with knowledge regarding a diverse range of potential fields 
        and the various career paths within these fields. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They will discuss specific skill sets that enable you 
        to excel in a particular field, coursework that might be useful preparation, 
        and, more generally, the relevance of a liberal arts background within 
        their industry." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the panel discussions and networking receptions, 
        Tessler noted that a list of participating alums will be made available 
        in the CPC in advance of the program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a total of nine site visits available 
        to Bowdoin students over the two-day period. The series kicks off on Tuesday, 
        March 20 following a networking event in Boston entitled "Navigating the 
        New Economy" on the 19th. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday morning, two career fields will offer visits: 
        Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital Partners 
        Health Care System will offer presentation and discussion about clinical 
        care, research, and health care administration; it will be open to 20 
        students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digitas, an e-business professional service, will also 
        be open to 20 students. The firm helps large businesses become e-businesses; 
        its Vice-President and Associate Marketing Director is Peter Espo '86.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of March 20, a visit to Massachusetts 
        State House will be open to ten students interested in government service. 
        David Morales '97, fiscal policy analyst in the Office of the Speaker 
        of the House of Representatives, has organized a comprehensive program 
        to provide students interested in public service, public policy, or law 
        with a broad overview of the many facets of state government.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten students will also be able to explore the social 
        service/public health career field through a visit on Tuesday to the Center 
        for Community Health Education Research & Service and the New England 
        Medical Center. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This visit is recommended for students considering work 
        as direct service providers, advocates, outreach workers, and community 
        organizers and educators in social justice and/or community health.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, March 21, visits will be offered to the 
        law firm of Beldock, Levine & Hoffman (open to 15 students); Time Inc., 
        International (open to 20 students); Sesame Workshop (open to 15 students); 
        the advertising firm Bates Worldwide (open to 20 students); and Morgan 
        Stanley Dean Witter, an investment banking firm (open to 15 students). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beldock, Levine & Hoffman works in the field of entertainment 
        law and represents numerous individuals who have a high profile in the 
        entertainment industry. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who visit Sesame Workshop will learn about 
        the Workshop's production model as well as the company's international 
        co-programs, since Charlotte Cole '82, vice president for international 
        research of the company, oversees the research and curriculum development 
        on all the company's international co-productions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking Outside the Bubble" concludes with a Networking 
        Event on Wednesday evening in New York. Entitled "Surviving and Thriving 
        in New York," this panel discussion will feature recent graduates sharing 
        advice and information on transitioning from Bowdoin to NYC. As with the 
        first Networking Event in Boston, a networking reception with alumni from 
        the City's Bowdoin Club will follow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students are encouraged to sign up early for any site 
        visits they are interested in, since spaces will be filled on a first-come, 
        first- serve basis. Registration forms for site visits must be submitted 
        to the Career Planning Center no later than Tuesday, March 6; a waitlist 
        will be established if sessions fill up. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deadline for sign ups for the panel discussions 
        and networking receptions has been extended by a week to March 13 to allow 
        students a chance to fit these events into their spring travel plans. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tessler said that she welcomes any questions students 
        have regarding the events. She remarked that "students from all class 
        years are encouraged to sign up for the events. This program will be helpful 
        for students who are in the early stages of the career-decision making 
        process as well as those who have more clear ideas about what they'd like 
        to do. Students who are clueless about what they want to do may find the 
        programs especially beneficial!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tessler said she believes that the success of the program 
        will lie in the level of participation on the part of students. As of 
        this week, there are still some spaces left at each of the site visits. 
        After the March 6 deadline, spaces will be opened up to recent Bowdoin 
        graduates based in Boston and New York.<br>
