      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Trustees had a busy schedule at last weekend's 
        meeting held at the Black Point Inn in Prout's Neck, Maine. The Board 
        discussed a report presented by the Committee of the Future, awarded tenure 
        to five professors, finalized the College's budget for the next fiscal 
        year, and talked about the possible construction of a new academic building.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report issued by the Committee of the Future was 
        compiled in December after faculty, staff, and students visited other 
        liberal arts colleges across the country.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report identifies what the committee believes are 
        specific trends occurring in liberal arts education and focuses on areas 
        such as identity, curriculum, faculty recruitment, admissions, and capital 
        resources.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling this an "opportunity for the self-education 
        of board members," Secretary of the College Richard Mersereau said that 
        the major purpose of this report was to identify the specific goals that 
        a liberal arts college such as Bowdoin should have.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the report are available on reserve at Hawthorne-Longfellow 
        Library.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trustees also voted to award tenure to five assistant 
        professors: Nancy Jennings in the Department of Education, Scott MacEachern 
        in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Madeleine Msall in the 
        Department of Physics and Astronomy, Elizabeth Muther in the Department 
        of English, and Patrick Rael in the Department of History.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board also approved the 2001-2002 budget for the 
        College, presented by Vice President for Finance and Administration and 
        Treasurer Kent Chabotar, and also approved the official tuition costs 
        for the 2001-2002 year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board also discussed the construction of a possible 
        new academic building on campus. This building would be located between 
        Adams Hall and Memorial Hall and would house the psychology and education 
        departments as well as the Baldwin Learning Center.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mersereau said that the plans for the building 
        were in no way definite, "talking about it at the meeting is enough to 
        say that we think enough of this plan to spend money on it, which is the 
        first action that leads to approval." If plans are carried out, between 
        $8 and $10 million will be allocated toward the construction.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the trustees discussed many issues during the 
        two-day meeting, only a few initiatives were voted on. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mersereau said, "The College is in transition right 
        now, with the president Robert Edwards leaving and the president-elect 
        Barry Mills coming in." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, he said, the Board of Trustees is in 
        a position that makes it difficult to make hard and fast decisions about 
        policies concerning the future direction of the College. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have made this as harmonious a transition as possible, 
        with very encouraging results," Mersereau said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in over twenty years, the trustees' 
        meeting was officially held off-campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for this, Mersereau said, was so that the 
        members of the Board, including trustees, students, and other representatives, 
        "could get to know one another much better in a relaxed atmosphere."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the original intents of this meeting, which had 
        been planned over a year in advance, was to officially elect the new president 
        of the College. However, because the Presidential Search Committee made 
        a decision six weeks ahead of schedule, the Board used the time to officially 
        thank the Committee for its hard work and difficult decision-making. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next meeting of the Board of Trustees is scheduled 
        for May 10-12. </p>
