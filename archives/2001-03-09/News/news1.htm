      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week's Common Hour featured a Campus Crosstalk 
        entitled "Inroads, Crossroads, or Both." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sponsored by the Student Government, this panel discussion 
        was mediated by Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs Wil Smith 
        '00 and addressed admissions policies at Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five panelists-sophomore Todd Buell and seniors 
        Catherine Williams, Jenn Dodd, Eliot Pope, and Alexander Ellis-each addressed 
        one of Smith's questions about admissions policy; this discussion was 
        followed by a question-and-answer period led by the audience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis discussed the role of the admissions office in 
        shaping the academic integrity of Bowdoin. He noted the problem of measuring 
        academic ability with grades and numbers, stating that the personal essay 
        and a student's extracurricular activities, especially athletics, often 
        serve as additional indicators of a student's academic and personal potential.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pope explained what he believed should be the institutional 
        priorities of Bowdoin: free exchange of ideas, the formation of a strong 
        bond between students and professors, collective learning and growth among 
        students, and academics.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked to describe the current academic environment at 
        Bowdoin, Williams depicted it as a personal, perpetual experience that 
        has changed throughout her four years at Bowdoin. She said that her best 
        professors at Bowdoin have been those who have truly been interested in 
        their students and in what they teach. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She added that it is also crucial that students be interested 
        in what they are learning if a positive academic environment is to exist 
        at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis added that the low student-to-teacher ratio should 
        also be appreciated by students; this rare benefit makes it impossible, 
        in his opinion, to not have a good academic experience at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pope said that students in the past four years have 
        become more open-minded to different cultures and perspectives, contributing 
        to the current healthy, fulfilling academic atmosphere of the College.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buell was given the difficult question of how the College 
        can define diversity within the context of its environment. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he believes that the College views diversity 
        too much as "diversity of 'color'" and thinks Admissions should focus 
        more on diversity of "thought" when making its acceptances. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College could improve upon its current approach, 
        he said, by aiming to attract more people who see the world from different 
        points of view. While Buell said that he did not think that this would 
        be as quick of a process as the current one, which emphasizes color, he 
        said he believes it would be more beneficial to the school in the long 
        run.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd addressed the issue of gender diversity in academics. 
        As a female majoring in physics who has also heavily involved herself 
        with a minor in music, Dodd said that she has had an extremely eye-opening 
        academic experience at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She described how difficult it was for her to decide 
        upon physics because of the gender imbalance. The male-dominated department 
        currently employs three male professors and only one female; in addition, 
        it is hiring another male professor for the 2001-2002 academic year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked how she believes Admissions could increase the 
        number of female students in the physics department, Dodd declared that 
        she does not think Bowdoin can vastly change this statistic. She stated 
        that the lack of women in the physical sciences is more a problem of society; 
        students need to be exposed to physics at a younger age, such as in grade 
        school, so women will feel more comfortable with it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question-and-answer period following the panel discussion 
        brought up many additional important issues concerning Bowdoin admissions. 
        One student remarked that the College cannot attract diversity but only 
        diverse students; in order to make the College itself diverse, the school 
        needs to be changed culturally and socially-diversity cannot be forced. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dodd raised the possibility of attracting more students 
        of color to live in the social houses as a way of raising social awareness 
        and cultural diversity on campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior John Willett challenged the College's current 
        definition of diversity to expand to include gay students, Asian-American 
        students, and other groups. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director of Alumni Relations Kevin Wesley remarked that 
        alumni of color do not remain involved with the College once they graduate; 
        last year, only three Asian-Americans and one African-American alumnus 
        came back for reunion weekend. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophomore Jane Hummer concluded last week's Common Hour 
        discussion with a reminder that Bowdoin Admissions can only do so much 
        to create a certain desired atmosphere on campus. The Office employs only 
        15 administrators; in reality, students have the potential to make much 
        more of an impact on Bowdoin than Admissions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By encouraging more of the people we know of different 
        races, ethnicities, and geographies to come to Bowdoin, Hummer said that 
        students can contribute immensely to the formation of a richer and deeper 
        social, cultural, and academic atmosphere at Bowdoin. </p>
