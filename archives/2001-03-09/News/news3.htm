      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 40 percent of Bowdoin students, approximately 
        650, have on-campus jobs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to recognize and honor these student employees, 
        as well as their supervisors, and in order to educate students about the 
        available employment opportunities on campus, the Student Employment Office 
        will sponsor Student Employment Week, beginning April 8. The week is nationally 
        supported and sponsored by the National Student Employment Association. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of the week is a reception honoring 
        approximately 35 outstanding student employees. Lisa Folk, manager of 
        student employment, said that in order to select which student employees 
        are honored, "supervisors nominate a 'one in five years' kind of employee-the 
        kind of student who gives 120 percent on a regular basis." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program is non-competitive and is intended to supplement 
        the student employee of the year award, which is competitive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, Kate Leppanen '01 was awarded the title of 
        Student Employee of the Year at Bowdoin and will go on to compete for 
        the state title. The winner of the state competition vies for the Northeast 
        award, and then the national title. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five years ago, Jennifer O'Neil, who worked in admissions, 
        was selected as Student Employee of the Year, and then went on to win 
        the national title. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student employment office also holds a supervisors 
        workshop during this week for full-time staff members and student managers. 
        The workshop focuses on the role of the supervisor as a mentor to student 
        employees, highlighting the active part they can play in the personal 
        lives of the students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erika Leach '02, special projects assistant for the 
        Student Employment Office, said that the week is a "way to say thank you 
        to the students and recognize the contributions they make, because many 
        parts of the College couldn't run without them."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The student employment office is also hosting an open 
        house at its office, located at Gustafson House, on Tuesday, April 10, 
        from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students can also show appreciation for their supervisors 
        by requesting certificates to honor their work as well. The request form 
        is on the <a href="www.bowdoin.edu/dept/seo/seohome.html">student employment 
        web site</a>. </p>
