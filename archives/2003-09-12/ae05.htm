      <p align="left">Jazz Seen, an exhibit on display at the Walker Art Museum, 
        is an attempt at translating the feelings and emotions behind jazz music 
        into a wide array of visual and cultural imagery. It was put together 
        with the input from Associate Professor of Music James McCalla, who uses 
        the it as a source in his class History of Jazz II.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Three pieces in the exhibit directly reference jazz. The first, by Roy 
        de Carava, is the original album cover to Miles Davis's Porgy and Bess 
        from 1958. Considered by many as the greatest American opera, Porgy and 
        Bess was adapted from a novel written by DuBose Heyward. Davis's groundbreaking 
        album was his second collaboration with the great arranger Gil Evans, 
        whom he was to work with numerous times over his entire career. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The two other pieces specifically derived from jazz are photographs showing 
        prominent female vocalists of their time. The first is a rare glimpse 
        of a laughing Billie Holiday taken from the late 1940s, showing Billie 
        as she leans back in her chair, smiling. The second photograph, a late 
        1960s picture of Betty Carter, emphasizes a similar playfulness. The exhibition 
        then moves on through what can best be called a &quot;jazzy&quot; aesthetic, 
        relinquishing the few historical captures on display for pieces of abstracted 
        art.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In a series of photolithographs entitled Jazz 1947, Henri Matisse creates 
        a collection of brightly colored shapes swirling against a yellow square 
        background, trimmed by a white border. With two pieces from Jazz 1947, 
        Matisse invokes through modernist techniques many of the most common associations 
        we usually make with jazz music. On another piece, the viewer can make 
        out both the word CIRQUE and a dark dancing figure cut out of a white 
        column, suggesting something of a festive atmosphere. Matisse also utilizes 
        the color blue in both pieces (more prominently in the latter); possibly 
        hinting at the blues as an important precursor of jazz music. His lithographs 
        swirl in a kind of dynamism that invokes the swing music of the Big Band 
        era. On the Matisse, McCalla comments, &quot;It is the both the rhythm 
        and movement of the two pieces that really touch on jazz music.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The remainder of the exhibit is composed of a series of black and white 
        photographs, mostly taken in New York City by acclaimed artists such as 
        Robert Louis Frank, Louis Farmer and Todd Webb. The photos range from 
        a black and white aerial shot of the Daily News Building taken in 1935 
        by Berenice Abbot to a photograph of Third Avenue by Todd Webb from 1946. 
        Most of the photographs suggest the mystery typified by the smoky jazz 
        clubs of a city that never sleeps. McCalla points to one photograph in 
        particular, which depicts two young black men sitting in Grand Central 
        station, wearing &quot;the sharpest, nattiest clothes, where we as viewers 
        don't even know if they are musicians or two hip cats of their time.&quot; 
        McCalla continues by saying that he likes &quot;not only their clothing 
        but their sense of self-assurance sitting together and obviously on top 
        of the world. It captures most of the emotional and feelings we have with 
        Bebop. The spirit of Bebop is in their meat hats and their whole thing.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other portraits, like Black Woman Standing Beside Light Pole, a Walker 
        Evans photograph of a woman standing on the corner of a street, suggest 
        the kind of cultural revolution and racial strife that culminated in the 
        Harlem Renaissance.</p>
      <p align="left"> Tucked into the corner hall of the bottom floor of the 
        Walker Art Museum, the show feels a bit limited, though, as McCalla points 
        out, the wing itself is dedicated specifically for academic venues, and 
        has always remained the same size. With strong intentions and a limited 
        framework, the exhibit makes a more than valid attempt at recreating the 
        full spectrum of cultural and social repercussions that jazz produced 
        throughout the Twentieth Century. In a college community sometimes ignorant 
        of jazz and its far-reaching capabilities, the exhibit is a small step 
        forward in an ever-expansive world. <br>
