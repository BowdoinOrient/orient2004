        <font size="2">JULEAH SWANSON<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Beginning this fall, student can now call the Safe Space 
        hotline for support, concerns, or general questions regarding sexual assault, 
        sexual harassment, or any other related topic. The hotline, which runs 
        Thursday through Saturday nights 10:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. and Sunday night 
        10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., allows students to speak confidentially to a 
        trained Safe Space member. &quot;We know that sexual assault and harassment 
        does occur at Bowdoin. Students call the Sexual Assault Support Services 
        of Midcoast Maine (SASSMM) hotline and deal with problems through the 
        dean's office with a fair amount of regularity, but Safe Space itself 
        is contacted by very few people,&quot; states Susan Buhr '04, co-coordinator 
        for Safe Space.</p>
      <p align="left"> In the past years Safe Space has been infamous for advertising 
        their services by posting contact information for current members on the 
        doors of most campus bathroom stalls. Through her experience with Safe 
        Space, Buhr acknowledges that in the past the bathroom lists have been 
        relatively ineffective, &quot;Most of the people that I have spoken with 
        personally said that they were hesitant to call anyone from the list, 
        because they felt it was too awkward to pick someone right off the list. 
        We hope that an anonymous format can put people more at ease. Safe Space's 
        goal is to aid survivors of assault, as well as just answering questions 
        about assault or harassment. And if people are not using us as a resource, 
        we would like to model ourselves in such a way that will make people feel 
        comfortable to do so.&quot; The bathroom lists, however, will continue 
        offering students a choice between calling the hotline or someone they 
        trust and know. </p>
      <p>In order to become a member of Safe Space, students must complete 27 
        hours of training through classes taught by educators from SASSMM on sexual 
        assault and sexual harassment. Additionally, those working directly on 
        the hotline must complete a hotline-training course. &quot;Safe Space 
        members are qualified to deal with people who have just been assaulted 
        or were assaulted at some time in the past, as well as friends or relatives 
        of someone who has been,&quot; says Buhr. &quot;We are also very well-qualified 
        to answer any informational questions people might have about date-rape 
        drugs, laws, and ways of dealing with an assault.&quot; By calling the 
        hotline, students will speak with trained Safe Space members who are available 
        to listen, support, or even answer any informal questions students may 
        have.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's really important that students feel they have a resource on 
        campus that they can go to when they feel they need advice or help but 
        are having doubts about discussing what has happened to someone face to 
        face,&quot; affirms Safe Space member Mara Gandal '04. &quot;Also, since 
        the health center and counseling centers aren't open during the weekends 
        at night, we can provide resources and help people who otherwise might 
        not have anywhere to go. It's not just for people who've been assaulted 
        at a party that evening. The hotline will give students who are dealing 
        with past issues, things that have happened to a friend or family member, 
        or even just short questions a place to ask these questions without any 
        inhibitions.&quot;</p>
      <p>The idea of a hotline began spring semester 2003 when members of Safe 
        Space, outside students, and members of the administration including Assistant 
        Dean of Student Affairs Mary Pat McMahon brought the idea before the Safe 
        Space coordinators. Over the summer months Safe Space has worked closely 
        with the administration, Residential Life, and SASSMM, in order to bring 
        about the hotline. Commencing during the first-year orientation, the hotline 
        offered incoming students an opportunity to call with questions regarding 
        initial qualms about safety and college life. Initial response to the 
        hotline has been positive. &quot;The students I've talked to think it 
        is a good idea, since people know that sexual harassment and sexual assault 
        happen to Bowdoin students while here and at other times in their lives,&quot; 
        responds Gandal.</p>
      <p>The Safe Space hotline is available to all students Thursday through 
        Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. and Sunday 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. 
        by calling 207-837-1692. The phone number is a local phone call, however 
        it is not an on-campus number, thus there is no extension for the hotline. 
        &quot;Survivors of sexual assault, friends of survivors, people in a crisis 
        situation, and people who just have questions are all encouraged to call,&quot; 
        says Buhr. If, however, a student is not comfortable speaking with a member 
        of Safe Space, other resources are available on campus or locally by contacting 
        the dean's office, counseling service, health center, or SASSMM's hotline.<br>
