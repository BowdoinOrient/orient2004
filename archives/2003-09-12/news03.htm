      Located on the southwest corner of Bath Road and Sills Drive, next to Sills 
      Hall and Cleveland Hall, Kanbar will provide classrooms, faculty offices 
      and workspace for students. The psychology department will occupy the basement, 
      second and third floors, as well as parts of the first floor, while the 
      Education Department, Quantitative Skills Program, Writing Project, and 
      Baldwin Center for Learning and Teaching will also share the first floor. 
      <p>Capital Projects Program Manager Don Borkowski is enthusiastic about 
        the new building. &quot;It will be quite an attractive building--brick, 
        metal and a lot of glass on the main fa&ccedil;ade. The interior has a 
        contemporary look.&quot; The building will have three entrances including 
        one on the quad between Sills Hall and Hatch Science Library.</p>
      <p>Another location considered for Kanbar was the open space north of Massachusetts 
        Hall, however the current development site is the only corner location 
        undeveloped with enough space. Originally the building was oriented to 
        face the quad. Later, the committee decided to make the corner side more 
        &quot;open and welcoming&quot; as a statement that &quot;you've arrived 
        at Bowdoin.&quot; </p>
      <p>Up to 70 construction workers will be involved in the construction Monday 
        through Friday. The Sills quad will serve as a staging area for trailers 
        and construction vehicles. </p>
      <p>Psychology Department Chair Louisa Slowiaczek, a member of the Bowdoin 
        Academic Building Committee with Borkowski during the more than two-plus 
        years of planning, said, &quot;We've been waiting a long time for this. 
        It's been a balancing act between funding and working on the design. There 
        is just so much involved in planning a building.&quot; </p>
      <p>In describing the design as &quot;state of the art,&quot; Slowiaczek 
        said, &quot;The Psychology Department has sub-par space in Banister right 
        now, so we are extremely excited to move into Kanbar. People won't be 
        as anxious to leave the building, compared to Banister,&quot; said Slowiaczek. 
        She said the building will be a better showcase for what people in psychology 
        really do. Included in the design are resource rooms on the third floor 
        with mirrored glass for observation rooms and auditory and visual perception 
        lab space. </p>
      <p>The space will also unite the neuroscience classes within the Psychology 
        Department with the rest of the department's classes. All neuroscience 
        classes will meet in the basement and utilize the teaching and research 
        labs. </p>
      <p>Education Department Chair Nancy Jennings is excited about the move to 
        Kanbar. She said, &quot;I'm very delighted about [Kanbar]. It will be 
        great to be on the main part of campus.&quot; Jennings also said she was 
        pleased to share a building with the other departments, since they share 
        many students with common interests. </p>
      <p>The entire Education Department will move into the first floor, where 
        there will be offices, a resource room, a quiet lounge study area, a computer 
        lab and technology room, seminar room, and a 50-seat classroom. The main 
        resource room, referred to by some of the department chairs as the &quot;Learning 
        Lounge,&quot; will be shared, along with office space, with the Baldwin 
        Center, the Quantitative Skills Program, and the Writing Project. </p>
      <p>Writing Project Director Kathleen O'Connor said, &quot;After ten years 
        of no specific program space, it will be wonderful to have one location 
        for all our records and resources.&quot; The Writing Project, which helps 
        students improve their writing skills through peer discussions, previously 
        had no designated space, with students meeting for appointments at such 
        locations as the Caf&eacute; or Moulton Union. </p>
      <p>O'Connor agreed that it is an appropriate combination of departments 
        moving into Kanbar. She noted how the Psychology and Education Departments, 
        as well as the three academic programs, all have related missions, thus 
        making the space more identifiable for academic support. </p>
      <p>&quot;There is real potential. Bowdoin's three primary academic advisory 
        programs' communication will certainly improve just by the proximity the 
        facility will provide us all,&quot; Director of the Quantitative Skills 
        Program Linda Kirstein said. The Quantitative Skills Program also had 
        no designated space.</p>
      <p>&quot;The architects called Kanbar the 'Brain Building' at first, because 
        of the disciplines that would use the facility--Psychology, Education 
        and academic advisory programs.&quot; said O'Connor. &quot;We insisted 
        they use some heart too, because learning requires both.&quot;<br>
