      Those of you that have risen above some of the published public dissent 
      and still came out on Saturday afternoons and got behind the squad know 
      that this season will be special one. Especially those who have fought in 
      the trenches of Whittier know that this season will stand out in the record 
      books.
<p>The feeling at preseason has been that of overwhelming suspense. The 
        Bears will open with a home game against 2002 league champions Williams 
        College and the team can not wait to come out to turn some heads. The 
        work that the Bears have put in throughout the off-season will no doubt 
        show itself in the form of wins this season.</p>
      <p>The holes that marred the team last year have been remedied with an incoming 
        freshman class whose depth almost caused the coaching staff to make cuts 
        to preserve the 75-man roster. One such area that hurt the Bears last 
        season was the defensive backfield. Due to injuries throughout most of 
        the season and other problems, the squad fielded two freshman in starting 
        roles.</p>
      <p>Although preseason injuries have drastically kept the numbers in the 
        defensive backfield down, the players that will be seen on Saturday afternoons 
        are a year stronger and wiser. The unit will be lead by junior cornerback 
        Andrew Parsons, who missed most of last season. Anchored on the other 
        side by sophomore Mike Minogue, the Bears' ability to cover the flanks 
        has improved since last year. Others in the mix will be sophomores Ahran 
        Cohen and Steve Curwin, who will be fielding the safety spots.</p>
      <p>A strength that returns this season is the defensive front. A solid core 
        of inside linebackers led by senior Jeb Boudreau will once again tie up 
        the inside. The speed and strength of the defensive line have improved 
        as well. Defensive lineman Jarrett Young '03 and Mike Stratton '05 will 
        be stalwarts on the inside as well. </p>
      <p>A key move that the coaching staff has made this season is moving four-year 
        starter Chris Wagner '04 from interior line to a defensive end position. 
        Anchored on the other side by seniors Brandon Casten and Mike Costello, 
        the overall speed and strength of these players will be important in containing 
        the outside rushing yards that hurt the Bears last year, noticeably in 
        games against Bates and Amherst. Other players to watch are outside linebackers 
        Bryan Duggan '05 and Mike Vitousek '07. The return of 2002 sack leader 
        Jeff Pike '04.</p>
      <p>Another strong point that will carry the Bears this season is their veteran 
        offensive line with four out of five linemen returning on the squad. This 
        includes second team all-NESCAC tackle Greg Berry '05. The other bookend 
        will be junior Chris Zerilli, who was primarily used as a utility lineman 
        last season. Inside, the guards will be Shaun Gagnon '05 and Jim Weeks 
        '04; a pair of players that effectively cleared the middle last season 
        and can also be used for their speed to pull and attack the flanks. Team 
        captain Bobby Desaulniers will return at center to complete the line. 
      </p>
      <p>The receiving core of the Bears is also an area where another year in 
        the weight room has helped dramatically. Tight ends Mark Drauschke '04 
        and sophomore Jared Pritchard will provide effective run blocking on the 
        ends and also pose a threat downfield for opposing defensive backs. Injuries 
        on the offensive line, however, could place Drauschke at tackle, in which 
        case sophomore former defensive end Mike Hickey could see some minutes 
        at the tight end slot.</p>
      <p>An array of quick playmakers will play in the wide-out slots this season. 
        Starter Brian Durant '05, who showed bright spots in the offensively dismal 
        game against Tufts last year, will head the core. Senior Drew Loucks and 
        sophomore Scott Brisson both have the speed and quickness to challenge 
        teams with the deep ball. The 2003 personnel will spread out defense, 
        hence opening up the passing attack and, reciprocally, assist the running 
        game.</p>
      <p>The Bears may boast one of the most impressive running back units in 
        the NESCAC. Returning starting tailback Rob Patchett '05 will take most 
        of the carries. His efforts will be complimented with the power of goal 
        line specialist Matt Boyd '06 and former outside linebacker Jesse Demers 
        '05.</p>
      <p>Power inside will not be an issue for the running back unit as 2002 starter 
        Chris Stratton returns. His ability to clear out linebackers and defenders 
        on the flank will open holes wide for Patchett and the other backs. Sophomore 
        Pat Lyons, who runs with power, has stepped in to back up Stratton.</p>
      <p>Approaching this season, the quarterback position was a huge question 
        mark. None of the remaining QBs on the squad have ever been battle tested, 
        with the exception of junior Tom McMahon who played some snaps last year 
        against Tufts. Entering preseason, there was a battle for the position. 
        Along with McMahon, junior Mike Ferrante and sophomore Ricky LeClerc all 
        fought for the spot. All three looked impressive in preseason, but injury 
        took LeClerc as he went down with a broken foot in the intersquad scrimmage 
        last Saturday. This weekend's scrimmage at Middlebury will undoubtedly 
        distinguish a starter, but, at this point it is tough to call who will 
        start against Williams in the season opener.</p>
      <p>Overall, expectations for the season are high. The team knows that the 
        depth it has gained coming into this year will help them compete at positions 
        and also effectively fill in for injuries. Their strengths from last season, 
        both the defensive and offensive lines, are a year stronger and smarter. 
        The improvements in the offensive backfield will spread open the offense 
        so the Bears will be able to use their speed to create big plays and higher 
        scores.</p>
      <p>There is an unmistakable eerie feeling at the practices thus far. It 
        is a feeling that can only be described as a confidence that the team 
        has not carried in the past few years. This coupled with a burning desire 
        to build on the improvements shown at the end of last season will bring 
        success to the Bears this season. Before a big fight, Muhammad Ali stated, 
        &quot;The fight is won or lost far away from witnesses behind the lines, 
        in the gym and out there on the road long before I dance under those lights.&quot; 
        The Bears have put in the work in the gym and on the road, and the team 
        will dance victoriously under the lights this season.<br>
