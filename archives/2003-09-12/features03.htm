      <p align="left">Dear Lindsay,</p>
      <p align="left">This is my first year at Bowdoin. I live on a coed floor, 
        and I really like one of the guys down the hall. We get along really well 
        and are pretty flirty with one another, especially when we see each other 
        out at parties. However, he has a girlfriend from back home. They've been 
        dating since the end of senior year and spent the whole summer together. 
        Whenever I try to bring her up, he changes the subject, so I don't know 
        how serious their relationship is. Should I let him know I'm interested 
        in more than a friendship? </p>
      <p align="left">Thanks,<br>
        <br>
        Frustrated First-year</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Dear Frustrated First-year,</p>
      <p>Since your current situation is obviously making you unhappy, you need 
        to do something about it as soon as possible. Don't prolong your misery 
        any longer than necessary (unless you are one of those people who has 
        watched one too many soaps and are trying to turn your dorm into &quot;Days 
        of our Lives at a Small College in New England&quot;). You must figure 
        out how serious he is with what's-her-face back home. Obviously your casual 
        attempts to bring up their relationship aren't working, so it's time to 
        take a different approach. </p>
      <p>Now I realize that taking action will be difficult, because you don't 
        want to a) find out that the ring he wears on his left ring finger is 
        actually a premature wedding band or b) discover that he's over her but 
        not into you - ouch. Keep in mind that there are eight-hundred-some-odd 
        male polar bears out there who may just be waiting to claw up your dorm 
        door. Grrrrr. So, here are a few options. </p>
      <p>One, be direct. The next time you're alone with Mr. Wonderful say, &quot;So, 
        your girlfriend's somewhere else, and here I am. Funny&#133;.&quot; This 
        is best said with an innocent wide-eyed, doe-like expression, since you 
        don't want to come on too strong or anything. Two, ask one of your two 
        roommates (whichever one you're &quot;tighter&quot; with) to ask one of 
        his two roommates (preferably the one he's more &quot;buddy buddy&quot; 
        with) why your love interest is living in the past when the future is 
        not only now, but a few doors down.</p>
      <p>I don't necessarily advise you to go with option number one or two. I'm 
        just giving you choices. What I do advise is that you put on your detective's 
        hat and start to look for certain tell-tale signs that reveal how committed 
        your man is to holding onto the past. For instance, next time you're in 
        his room, look around for pictures of &quot;her.&quot; I don't mean to 
        dash any of your hopes, but if you immediately spot a framed 8x11 portrait 
        beside his bed that is signed &quot;I love you always&quot; with hearts 
        around it, beware. However, if there is no pictorial evidence anywhere 
        in the room that a girlfriend even exists, continue on with your investigation. 
      </p>
      <p>Take a careful look at his clothes. Does he dress well? Does he dress 
        too well? Here's an example: any given day he is likely to be seen wearing 
        boat shoes, khaki shorts, a grosgrain belt, and pink Lacoste shirt. This 
        could mean one of two things. One, he went to prep school. If so, the 
        boat shoes will be scuffed up, the khakis wrinkled, and either a shave 
        or a haircut will be a bit overdue. Two, his girlfriend dressed him all 
        summer long, and he has yet to realize summer is over and that his relationship 
        should be too.<br>
        Some other sleuthing suggestions include hanging around his room at night 
        and seeing if he gets calls from her or makes calls to her. Ask him if 
        he got any mail that day. Hallmarks in pink envelopes are bad news. Start 
        a conversation about long-distance romances (and their pitfalls). And 
        last of all, when the weekend rolls around, notice if he picks up to go 
        home or if a girl who introduces herself as &quot;his girlfriend&quot; 
        comes to stay with him. <br>
        Hopefully some of these suggestions will help you to open your eyes to 
        the truth about his relationship. You will be glad that you took the initiative 
        to figure out where you two stand. If his heart is still back home, let 
        it stay there. As much as you don't want to hear this, you also don't 
        want to be the reason why they broke up. And remember, they may go their 
        separate ways on their own. The year is still very young. Give it time 
        to unfold. However, if you can honestly tell yourself that she's a page 
        in his past (and that they must have &quot;forgotten&quot; to break it 
        off when the summer ended), talk to him. Ask him in all seriousness what 
        the deal is with his relationship, and don't let him off the hook if he 
        tries to change the subject. If he's the kind of guy worth dating, he 
        won't just leave you hanging. He'll give you a straight answer to your 
        question, and then you can figure out where you want to go from there. 
        Good luck!</p>
