        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">On June 28, 1949, President Kenneth C. M. Sills wrote to 
        Judge William Malone, &quot;Bowdoin College is delighted to have the sextant 
        which you found on the Grand or Hamilton River in Labrador in 1923 that 
        belonged to the Cary and Cole expedition.&quot; The story of this expedition, 
        he said, is &quot;almost a Bowdoin epic.&quot; Almost. Not many people 
        know of it today. Somehow, as the years passed, this great wilderness 
        adventure slipped through the cracks, along with the rest of Bowdoin's 
        arctic heritage. To most current students, Bowdoin's arctic connection 
        consists only of a small museum called Peary-MacMillan, tucked away in 
        Hubbard Hall. But just beneath the surface lies a rich tradition of Arctic 
        studies that was jump started by an 1891 expedition to the northern waters 
        by a group of hardy and courageous Bowdoin men.</p>
      <p>This series will focus on that 1891 expedition, which was led by Professor 
        Leslie A. Lee along the coast of Labrador and up the Grand River. It was 
        an expedition that brought recognition to the College and adventure to 
        eighteen of its sons. However, the trip was preceded by a lesser-known 
        excursion, led by the Bowdoin and Williams chemistry Professor Paul A. 
        Chadbourne in 1860 to Greenland by way of Labrador. This trip mainly consisted 
        of Williams College students, but the Professor envisioned grand plans 
        for the excursion and opened it up to students from other colleges.</p>
      <p>For a vessel, Chadbourne contacted an acquaintance in Thomaston, a ship 
        captain named Charles E. Ranlett. Ranlett was hesitant to offer himself 
        and one of his ships for this expedition. College students? Chadbourne 
        must be crazy. And how many? One college boy might be alright, but if 
        gathered together-seventeen from Williams, three from Bowdoin, two from 
        Harvard, and one from Columbia-the boys would no doubt be rowdy and unreliable. 
        Providing a boat and finances for this undertaking would be risky. However, 
        since these were science students with research in mind, the captain eventually 
        assented. A 1964 article in the Portland Press Herald joked that since 
        the expedition already included a Harvard man, it was good that no Yale 
        student would be aboard, because no ship would be big enough for the both 
        of them.</p>
      <p>The number of students intended for the trip grew so much that Ranlett's 
        brand new schooner Nautilus had to be specially outfitted for twenty-three 
        students, a captain, and a professor planning an expedition that would 
        reach above the Arctic Circle. Finally, in the early morning of June 27, 
        1860, the Nautilus set sail from Thomaston out to the cool calm open ocean. 
        Though the sun had not yet risen, the people of Thomaston came out with 
        flowers, music, and good wishes for the boys on the schooner.</p>
      <p>Once the boys were well away from the land, the mood of the cool calm 
        sea shifted. A student writing for the Williams Quarterly bemoaned the 
        awful sea-sickness that left him feeling &quot;as though the stomach were 
        a very Jonah and every power of the system were taxed to rid the body 
        of this dangerous member.&quot; After they got their sea legs, the students 
        began to take in the ocean's full splendor. What a feeling-to be out of 
        sight of all land, surrounded by a blue ocean that appeared just as vast 
        as the great blue sky. On a lone, tiny vessel amid the churning waters 
        of the Atlantic, a man can't help but compare his weak humanity to the 
        awesome power of nature. His first experience as a vulnerable speck in 
        a stormy sea brings home the hard lesson that both man and boat are at 
        the complete mercy of the elements-they are able to move only if the wind 
        and the current allow, and should they fall into displeasure with the 
        sea, a sudden squall could easily cut their voyage short, plunging them 
        into the raging depths. Soon, however, both the seasickness and the fear 
        of the open ocean were subdued, giving way to the reality of the task 
        at hand-the academic work of the expedition will be both exciting and 
        exhausting, but that will have to wait. Until they reached their destination, 
        the boys could do nothing but be relaxed by the steady rhythm of the waves.<br>
