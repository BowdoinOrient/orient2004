        <font size="2">MIKE NUGENT<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Francois Ozon's &quot;Swimming Pool&quot;, following in 
        the tradition of some of his earlier, greater films like &quot;8 Women&quot;, 
        weaves a mystery story into a psychological tale of intrigue. However, 
        Ozon's lofty goals never really take flight in a movie with nearly no 
        forward momentum and characters too underdeveloped to keep the movie interesting.</p>
      <p align="left">Sarah Morton (Charlotte Rampling) is a successful writer 
        of a series of cheap mystery novels in England, but has lately been feeling 
        old and uninspired. So her publisher John invites her to use his French 
        villa to relax and regain some of her creativity. Sarah takes him up on 
        the offer and heads off to France. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Once there, Sarah eagerly begins to write, enjoying the 
        silence and the luxuries of her new home. That is until Julie (Ludivine 
        Sagnier) arrives. Julie is John's daughter, a young French woman who flaunts 
        her blossoming sexuality with each high-heeled prance. The rest of the 
        movie covers their relationship, mostly rocky due to their obvious differences; 
        Julie is young, fashionable, and free from nearly all inhibitions, while 
        Sarah is old and orthodox in clothes and manner.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; is Rampling's movie, 
        and she is unquestionably the lead character, it is Sagnier that shines 
        brightest here. With slight changes in expression, she accurately captures 
        the essence of a somewhat promiscuous young woman who may enjoy being 
        wild, yet truly wishes for a man she can eventually settle down with. 
        Until then she hides behind her mask of popularity and excitement.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Overall, however, director Francois Ozon gives his actresses 
        very little to work with. Rampling, forced to carve out a three dimensional 
        portrait out of a caricature of a snotty Englishwoman, does a decent job 
        with what she had to work with. But her only significant character development 
        to speak of was a very orthodox portrayal of Sarah losing her inhibitions. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ozon leaves many unanswered questions throughout the movie, 
        all of which would have helped to strengthen the script and improve character 
        development. Was Sarah ever sexually attracted to Julie? Was she ever 
        in an affair with her publisher, John? The viewer is left in the dark 
        on the contents of Sarah's writing, even after Julie reads her novel, 
        something that Sarah had explicitly forbid and which has serious implications 
        later on.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Potentially most damaging is the nearly complete ignoring 
        of the main motif of the movie, the swimming pool. Ozon shows Sarah swimming 
        in the water after she previously had said she hated pools. This action 
        is analogous to the loosening up of her character, yet that is the extent 
        of it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The surprise twist at the end will not be divulged here, 
        but I will say it proves that &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; has more to do 
        with Sarah Morton's imagination than with the actual story presented. 
        Yet when the movie seemed to only be striving for the authenticity and 
        depth of one of Sarah Morton's cheap mystery novels, and it does achieve 
        that goal. How interesting or deep is that imagination?</p>
