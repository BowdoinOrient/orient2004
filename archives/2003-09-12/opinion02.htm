      <p align="left"><font size="5">What Dean has to offer and why it's enough to win<br>
        <font size="2">JAMES BAUMBERGER</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Six months ago, Howard Dean was barely a factor. Nobody 
        thought a liberal former governor from a small New England state could 
        actually shake things up in the democratic nomination battle for the 2004 
        presidential election. But the meteoric rise of this dark horse candidate 
        has challenged the very assumptions that seemed to doom his candidacy 
        from the beginning.</p>
      <p>Dean has defied political experts by raising large sums of money over 
        the internet, developing massive grassroots support, and gaining a commanding 
        lead over John Kerry in the key primary state of New Hampshire. There 
        is no denying now that Howard Dean is a serious candidate, if not the 
        outright frontrunner.</p>
      <p>Initially, his candidacy was greeted with skepticism. The biggest strike 
        against Dean is that he's too liberal to win a general election. Conventional 
        wisdom says that the most centrist candidate will win. Dean is admittedly 
        more extreme than the other high-profile candidates, but he has a wealth 
        of advantages that the others lack.</p>
      <p>A great deal of Dean's appeal as a candidate comes from his willingness 
        to take principled stands on issues outside of the realm of centrist politics. 
        He appears removed from the race to the middle in which his fellow candidates 
        are often engaged. For instance, Dean's opposition to the Bush administration's 
        war on Iraq came during a time when the public overwhelmingly supported 
        the war effort. This gutsy position showed that Dean has a backbone, something 
        many will concede the Democratic Party has been lacking recently.</p>
      <p>It is this sense of principle and gravitas that has helped Dean attract 
        an army of enthusiastic volunteers and raise more money than anyone thought 
        he could. Simply put, he excites people in a way the other candidates 
        do not. Despite his leftward leanings, Dean will have the ability to excite 
        even independents like other candidates cannot.</p>
      <p>Can anyone honestly get excited about John Kerry? I doubt it. Democrats 
        seem to support Kerry solely because they assume that he is the most electable 
        option. But when Kerry tries harder to match Bush where he is strong than 
        to challenge him where he is weak, one wonders how Kerry intends to effectively 
        challenge Bush without showing any contrast. Kerry made his official campaign 
        announcement in front of an aircraft carrier. Sound familiar? Just add 
        a jet and a flak jacket and the picture should remind you of Bush. He 
        then tried awkwardly to criticize Bush's Iraq policy after he voted in 
        the Senate to support the war. It is this wishy-washiness that is Kerry's 
        main drawback. He dances around controversial issues rather than taking 
        them on, and Democrats don't like it.</p>
      <p>The other candidates haven't fared much better. Gephardt, Lieberman, 
        and Edwards all voted for the Iraq war authorization. Gephardt isn't doing 
        as well as he needs to in Iowa and has had serious trouble raising money. 
        Lieberman, who is still carrying around baggage from 2000, is so conservative 
        he's starting to look like a Republican. Edwards has quickly become the 
        papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; candidate, almost completely lacking in substance. 
        And the four other candidates in the race have made little progress.</p>
      <p>So that leaves Dean.</p>
      <p>Yes, Dean's liberal, but he really isn't the ultra-liberal politician 
        he is made out to be, and that will help him go up against Bush. He's 
        a fiscal conservative, and therefore somewhat resistant to the perennial 
        Republican slander of &quot;tax and spend liberal.&quot; He's even open 
        to the possibility of amending the constitution to require balanced budgets. 
        Dean's also an ardent supporter of states rights; he opposes national 
        gun control measures because he feels it should be the states' prerogative. 
        He earned an A grade from the National Rifle Association.</p>
      <p>Even his liberal agenda isn't that far out. He supports gay rights, but 
        doesn't think that the federal government should mandate that states approve 
        same-sex marriage (sadly, this will play well among the American electorate). 
        While governor of Vermont, Dean provided health insurance for the lowest 
        wage-earners and each Vermonter under the age of 18, all while maintaining 
        a balanced budget. Sure he supports repealing the Bush tax cuts and protecting 
        the environment, but then again so do the other candidates.</p>
      <p>Howard Dean is not so middle-of-the-road that he won't be able to excite 
        voters and mobilize the Democratic base, and he's not so liberal that 
        he won't be able to connect with the average American. He occupies a unique 
        place on the political spectrum, one that puts him in a great position 
        to take on Bush.<br>
