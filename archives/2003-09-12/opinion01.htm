        <font size="2">PAT ROCKEFELLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> With more than a touch of in-your-face-sentiment I've been 
        harangued lately by friend and foe alike over the fact that the only WMD's 
        found in Iraq so far were human shredding machines, rape rooms, and enough 
        car battery powered nut-shockers to satisfy even the most phallic obsessed 
        of tyrants. Of course, they don't phrase it that way.</p>
      <p align="left">So, should I eat crow, or no?</p>
      <p align="left">Let it be said that this is an unambiguous embarrassment 
        for the Bush Administration as their primary reason for war has yet to 
        pan out. While few amongst us will shed a tear for the infringement upon 
        Saddam's right to an enslaved populace, and we can all be happy that the 
        death of his two sons will prevent a hereditary Hussein thugocracy, the 
        advancement of human rights was never more than a positive externality 
        in the war making decision. A very positive externality, sure, one not 
        to be forgotten, and arguably worth the war itself, especially considering 
        the low casualties amongst coalition soldiers and Iraqi civilians, but 
        the U.S. went to war for national interests, not human rights. </p>
      <p align="left">So, did Bush lie? One of the most disturbing trends of the 
        last couple decades is how little we know about the actions of other countries 
        and non-state actors. From the surprisingly quick collapse of the Soviet 
        Union, to the testing of nuclear weapons by Pakistan and India, to September 
        11th, U.S. intelligence has been struggling to keep up. Bush didn't lie 
        - he didn't know. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And for that matter, neither did anyone else. Keep in mind 
        that even our anti-war 'allies' (Germany, Russia, France) didn't make 
        their case based on a lack of evidence. None of these nations questioned 
        that Iraq had WMD and/or was attempting to build them. Their cases, right 
        or wrong, were based, at least rhetorically on the primacy of sanctions 
        and the necessity of U.N. backing. None of them stood up at the U.N. and 
        said 'Hey, uh, fellas&#133;call us crazy, but we think maybe Hussein destroyed 
        all his weapons but didn't tell any one about it.' </p>
      <p align="left">The real question, the one I hope is being asked by the 
        White House of the intelligence agencies is 'What the hell is going on 
        here?' Is it possible that Saddam destroyed his caches of chemical and 
        bio weapons? His labs? His blueprints? His documentation? How about the 
        documents that documented the destruction of the weapons? Maybe it is. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hussein wanted an end to U.N. imposed sanctions. The only 
        way he could get that was to prove he had no weapons. However, to prove 
        he had no weapons, he would have to essentially surrender his sovereignty 
        for a period of time, during which he would be vulnerable to pressure, 
        coups, and assassinations from domestic and foreign sources as Iraq opened 
        itself up to the world. Additionally, he viewed his chemical and biological 
        abilities as deterrents against other regional threats, such as Iran, 
        which is significantly larger than Iraq. Having these weapons, or making 
        others think he had these weapons offered him security and regional dominance.</p>
      <p align="left">The gamble Hussein made was that the U.S. would not go through 
        with its threat of invasion. After the half hearted Gulf War of Bush Sr., 
        and the low risk, low intensity cruise missile bombings of Clinton, regional 
        withdrawal of U.S. troops from Lebanon in '84, Somalia in '92, the embassy 
        bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in '98, the USS Cole in '00, Hussein's 
        gamble may not have been all that bad. Had the U.S. been content to strike 
        at suspected unconventional weapon sites then withdraw, the pressure to 
        maintain sanctions may well have abated with Saddam in power and the status 
        of his WMD program perfectly ambiguous. </p>
      <p align="left">Of course a team of Army engineers could still find a storage 
        bunker buried deep under the sand loaded to the brim with the weapons 
        we knew Saddam once had. The real threat to Bush is that until this happens, 
        the public will lose faith in what we are being told, not because we necessarily 
        think the president is lying, but because we don't necessarily trust the 
        information he is given. It is also likely that the Bush Administration 
        as a whole will lose faith in those providing it with the information 
        it needs. </p>
      <p align="left">So, I'll skip the crow for now, and instead raise my glass 
        to a better future for Iraq, WMD or not. <br>
