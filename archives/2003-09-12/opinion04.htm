        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Dear Class of 2007, </p>
      <p>Here you are, about to embark your Bowdoin career. You're probably pretty 
        settled in by now, your classes decided, rooms fully decorated and neighbors 
        met. It is in these first few weeks that you may find your thoughts turning 
        to other areas of your lives: namely sex and relationships in their various 
        incarnations. Despite the statistics spewed by tour guides regarding our 
        extraordinary marriage rates, Bowdoin students actually may spend their 
        four years exploring an array of romantic options. Sometimes there seem 
        to be too many options, while at other times we feel trapped. After a 
        few years of writing columns on these very topics, I would like to impart 
        my wisdom onto you and introduce you to the Bowdoin social scene. Allow 
        me to explain what lies ahead under the Pines:</p>
      <p>The Random Hookup: Almost always associated with alcohol, this is the 
        easiest and most common affair at Bowdoin. In the real world, this may 
        be known as the &quot;one-night stand.&quot; A random hookup necessitates 
        two people, at least one of whom has usually decided to &quot;hook up&quot; 
        that night, and very high sex drives (often influenced by adolescence, 
        beer, tightly packed parties and either scant clothing due to warm weather 
        or boredom due to cold weather). Participants may be in different classes. 
        Generally, the two people have been introduced before and so they feel 
        comfortable enough to strike up a conversation that will later be accessorized 
        by arm-touching, eye contact and assorted other innuendo. This interaction 
        lasts anywhere from a half hour to two and results in the couple returning 
        to one's room, &quot;sexiling&quot; the roommates and engaging in anything 
        from basic kissing to intercourse. Sleeping over is optional, although 
        if this occurs, driving your guest home is highly encouraged. </p>
      <p>The random hookup rarely leads to anything except a few awkward encounters 
        later on-&quot;Oh my God, I hooked up with him the other week at _____.&quot; 
        (I can only think of one case where a random hookup led to a date that 
        led to a relationship. But I must stress that this is an extremely isolated 
        incident.) The Continuous (or Regular) Hookup: What happens when the people 
        involved in the random hookup &quot;clicked&quot; physically or one or 
        more is really desperate anything between a hookup and a relationship. 
        Participants generally like to say &quot;We just hook up&quot; or &quot;We're 
        kind of together, I guess, but we are NOT going out.&quot;It May last 
        for a while and include a minimal email relationship, but no real emotional 
        involvement is expected. (&quot;Expected&quot; is a key word here unfortunately, 
        in many cases, emotional involvement develops and ultimately causes stress, 
        tears and name-calling. This may be avoided with the substitution of basic 
        human kindness and decency in place of misleading clich&eacute;s that 
        may be deemed &quot;what she/he wants to hear.&quot;) Once again, I can 
        only think of a few examples of the continuous hookup leading to anything 
        more. It can also lead to awkwardness, like, &quot;She hates me because 
        last year, we were hooking up and then one night I &#133;&quot; </p>
      <p>The Friends Who Hook up: Has potential to be either the least or the 
        most complex of the bunch. In its benevolent form, two friends (who have 
        often had a few beers) have not gotten any in a while and so agree to 
        help each other out. Neither is particularly attracted to the other and 
        they remain friends, perhaps even closer, having gotten all sexual tension 
        out of the way. This is fine. It is also possible, though, that a Continuous 
        Hookup will ensue and therein lays the danger. If one or both of them 
        begins to think, &quot;Well, we really get along, and I am attracted to 
        him/her too. It makes sense for us to go out,&quot; there is a) the possibility 
        that the other party does not feel the same way and the friendship may 
        be ruined, or b) the possibility that a relationship will begin. It is 
        true that Friends Who Hook up may make fabulous couples and one day become 
        another marriage statistic. </p>
      <p>However, it is also possible that while two people get along and are 
        perhaps even attracted to eachother, they may lack that ineffable &quot;spark&quot; 
        that is necessary in order to sustain a loving relationship and can find 
        themselves in a very hurtful position, especially if they are in the same 
        group of friends. Thus the hypothesis: If and only if Friends Who Hook 
        up truly believe they can make it to The Healthy Bowdoin Relationship 
        (see below) then they should go for it. Otherwise, they should be wary 
        of the path they tread. </p>
      <p>The Non-Sexual Relationship: This is not a conventional sort of coupledom. 
        I include it only because I know of many heterosexual friendships that 
        extend far beyond the realms of usual 'guy friend'-'friend who's a girl' 
        but exclude hookups. That said, those involved depend on each other in 
        a manner usually associated with a boyfriend or girlfriend and will get 
        VERY jealous if the other leaves a party with someone else. It seems to 
        be something about emotional rather than physical fulfillment. I highly 
        advise against breaking these bonds unless in the pursuit of The Healthy 
        Bowdoin Relationship (see below) as the platonic friend will, more often 
        than not, win out. </p>
      <p>The Healthy Bowdoin Relationship: This occurs when two people who see 
        each other a lot (indicating many shared interests) and are unburdened 
        by a history of too-close friendship-realize that they are attracted to 
        each other. They get to know one another better and realize that their 
        attraction is more than physical (or more than mental, as the case may 
        be). One of the two, a common friend, or an uninhibited observer, might 
        bring up the fact that their feelings are mutual, but sometimes it just 
        happens on its own. Very important to success is that neither of the involved 
        have a boyfriend or girlfriend from home. The couple may, at this point, 
        begin to hook up but they are not in immediate danger of any of the above 
        problems because they have laid a sound foundation, hold no illusions 
        of the other and have the same sort of feelings upon entering the Healthy 
        Bowdoin Relationship. They will probably have dinner on birthdays, Valentines 
        Day, and a few other random occasions throughout the semester, although 
        depending on certain athletic affiliations, that number could diminish. 
        Healthy Bowdoin Relationships are characterized by each partner having 
        at least a few friends who are not friends with the other, and are flexible, 
        accommodating school and/or extracurricular stress. Healthy Bowdoin Couples 
        understand that sometimes, going collapsing into bed together is all you're 
        going to get for a week or two, while trusting that they will always be 
        there for each other. The Healthy Bowdoin Relationship is a rare thing 
        you may think it more common, but trust me, those are all shams and it's 
        actually quite hard to find so if you find yourself in one, make it work, 
        for Lord's sake. </p>
      <p>And so, dear freshmen, in conclusion, I hope I have helped you to understand 
        a little of what goes on here at Bowdoin. I'm sure you all experienced 
        a lot in high school but, in any case, this simplified catalogue is intended 
        to remind you what your options are as a Polar Bear. I would like to stress, 
        moreover, that these are hardly the only possibilities; they are but the 
        most common and easiest situations in which you find yourself. Do not 
        despair, those of you who leave parties with your own two hands in your 
        own two pockets. Just as enjoyable may be the evenings you rush home to 
        call Dominos before two and share pizza and laughter with good friends.
