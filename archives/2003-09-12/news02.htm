        <font size="2">EVRON LEGALL<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">After a lengthy &quot;sabbatical&quot; of sorts, in which 
        he served as lawyer, television host, corporate executive, and governor 
        of Maine, Angus King, Jr. will return to Bowdoin this spring with the 
        title &quot;Distinguished Lecturer.&quot; It will be his first official 
        position with the College since the 1970s.</p>
      <p>&quot;The idea is to have Angus King connected to the College in a variety 
        of ways,&quot; said Dean of Academic Affairs Craig McEwen. He said the 
        former governor's activities on campus would include his course &quot;Leaders 
        and Leadership,&quot; a public lecture, meetings with various student 
        groups and social houses, and to otherwise &quot;simply be available.&quot; 
        McEwen beamed at what he described as an &quot;exciting opportunity to 
        enrich the College.&quot;</p>
      <p>King will not be serving under any particular academic department, and 
        his course will definitely have an interdisciplinary slant. McEwen hinted 
        that he suspected the class would take a broad look at past world leaders-both 
        good and bad-in an effort to determine the important characteristics of 
        leaders. However, he stressed that King is currently in the process of 
        fine-tuning the details of the course and it is yet to be submitted for 
        review by the Curriculum and Educational Policy Committee. </p>
      <p>While there are no concerns about any special security arrangements the 
        former governor might require, McEwen said that it was highly likely that 
        there would be several restrictions on who could take the class simply 
        because of the sheer popularity that it may attract, saying that King 
        would prefer an interactive class to a formal lecture. </p>
      <p>King, a Dartmouth graduate, had taught in Bowdoin's Senior Center Program 
        in the mid-1970s. At that time, Coles Tower was known as the Senior Center 
        and housed only seniors.</p>
      <p>Following his time at the Senior Center, King practiced law at the firm 
        of Smith, Loyd and King, hosted a television show called Maine Watch, 
        and served as the vice-president of an alternative energy company in Portland. 
        He formed his own energy management company in Brunswick in 1989. </p>
      <p>In 1995, King began a two-term stint as Governor of Maine, as the only 
        independent governor in the United States. </p>
      <p>With his focus on conservation, education, and reform of state services, 
        King remained very popular in the state until the end of his term. He 
        recently returned from a five month, 34-state trip around the country 
        in a mobile home with his wife, Mary Herman, and their two young children, 
        Benjamin and Molly. </p>
      <p>There are no firm plans in place regarding King's relationship with the 
        College beyond Spring 2004.<br>
