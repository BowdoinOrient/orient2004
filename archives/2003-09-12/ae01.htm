      <p align="left">Raynes, a Visual Arts major with a substantial interest 
        in anthropology, studied near Kathmandu in Nepal last spring through a 
        Pitzer College program in which students took intensive courses to learn 
        the Nepali language and culture while they lived with host families. After 
        three months there, she moved to the high-altitude Anapurna region to 
        do an independent study on Aamatole women in the Gurung caste villages 
        of Sikkles and Tangting.</p>
      <p>Throughout her time in Nepal, Raynes worked on her photography project 
        on the side. She gave women disposable cameras to take shots of what they 
        found important in their lives, then interviewed them about their pictures. 
        Raynes took black and white portrait shots of the women as well. The women 
        received doubles or polaroids. &quot;People loved that,&quot; said Raynes. 
        &quot;I was in a place where people don't have pictures of themselves.&quot;</p>
      <p>The idea of giving cameras to subjects came from an encounter in a meat 
        market in China in the summer of 2002. Raynes was traveling with Nancy 
        Riley's Contemporary Chinese Society class, a journey that yielded a photo 
        exhibition displayed in Smith Union last December. After she took a picture 
        of a man in the market, she let him take a picture of her. By giving the 
        cameras to others, Raynes aims to &quot;transcend the power difference 
        between photographer and subject.&quot; Raynes cites artist Wendy Ewald 
        as an inspiration. Ewald has taught children in places of extreme cultural 
        conflict to use cameras and let children write on her portraits of them. 
        Her technique is called collaborative portraiture. </p>
      <p>Raynes has a particular interest in the voices of women. &quot;In Asian 
        cultures women are not treated as equal to men, nor are they in American 
        cultures,&quot; she says. &quot;Men and women are both humans, why are 
        men 'superior' around the world? I'm interested in seeing how women resist 
        this suppression, how they deal with it.&quot; </p>
      <p>In Nepal, Raynes was treated as a member of her household and had to 
        abide by Hindu rules, which place most of the house and field work on 
        the women. Raynes said that as a woman she was not treated with the respect 
        a man gets, but her gender opened up communication lines with Nepali women 
        that would have been closed to men. </p>
      <p>&quot;Giving them cameras gave them an opportunity to express themselves 
        in a way they would never think of doing,&quot; she said. Upon seeing 
        her photos, Tikka Kumari Bhahadur, 34, exclaimed &quot;I cannot read or 
        write, but I am good at taking pictures!&quot;</p>
      <p>The 17 women range in age from 5 to 70. Banita Ranabat, 12, took pictures 
        of the sun, of &quot;the wheat that makes our bread,&quot; of her mother. 
        Bijaya Laxmi Gurung, 11, took a picture of her schoolbook, &quot;because 
        studying is the most important thing in my life.&quot; Goma Bandari, 25, 
        who worked in the photo store, asked Raynes if she could be in the project. 
        &quot;I have never taken a photo before,&quot; she said. &quot;For me, 
        photographs are food.&quot; </p>
      <p>For the &quot;Mahatwapurna Kura Cameramaa Rakidinusna&quot; show, Raynes 
        arranged the photos in collages (which include photocopied children's 
        drawings, cloth, a mirror, and even cinderblocks) juxtaposed with quotes 
        from the photographers to put them in context. There are also two books 
        in the exhibition devoted to a pair of Nepali women that Raynes had a 
        wealth of material for. </p>
      <p>The fishbowl on the ground floor of the VAC contains Raynes' related 
        exhibition &quot;An Experience of Nepali Visual Culture,&quot; which combines 
        posters from Nepal with her color photos. The posters, which are rising 
        in popularity in the more urban areas of the country, range in topic from 
        inspirational quotes to Hindu deities to Nepal's royal family and soap 
        stars to American wrestler The Rock. </p>
      <p>Raynes received a Surdna Fellowship to fund the exhibition and her living 
        expenses this summer as she put it together. Art professor Mike Kolster 
        sponsored Raynes' Fellowship. &quot;Regardless of whether the Surdna came 
        through, Emma was going to do it anyway,&quot; Kolster said. Kolster says 
        that the school acknowledged the validity and importance of Raynes' ideas 
        through the grant of Fellowship. &quot;Emma was open to taking a lot of 
        different risks,&quot; said Kolster. </p>
      <p>The opening for the exhibition was held last Friday evening. Raynes wore 
        her Nepali garb. Students milled around taking in the project and snacking 
        on refreshments. </p>
      <p>&quot;I think it's amazing because of all the time she spent getting 
        to know the people and putting together the exhibit,&quot; said freshman 
        Laura Doore, whose pre-orientation trip was co-led by Raynes. </p>
      <p>&quot;I told my subjects that I would take their pictures back to the 
        United States to show them to my family and friends,&quot; writes Raynes 
        in her artist's statement. &quot;I told them that perhaps their images 
        would teach Americans about the lives of Nepali women&#133;. So this is 
        what I am doing.&quot;<br>
