      <p align="left">The Bowdoin men's soccer team pulled out a tough overtime 
        contest against Wheaton last Saturday on Pickard Field as juniors Tommy 
        Bresnehan and Tucker Hodgkins each scored in route to the Polar Bears' 
        2-1 victory.</p>

      Ranked eighth nationally and first in New England in the most recent NCAA 
      polls, this year's edition of the men's squad features a strong core of 
      returning veterans, who along with several promising newcomers should challenge 
      for the NESCAC title they narrowly lost a year ago.
<p>The numerous fans who gathered to watch the season opener fell silent 
        midway through the first half, as Bowdoin fell behind 1-0 with a beautiful 
        corner kick goal by Wheaton's Barry Finnerty. A sprawling save by goalkeeper 
        Travis Derr '04 prevented the Polar Bears from falling behind by two goals. 
        The score remained 1-0 heading into halftime, a deficit that was fortunate 
        considering Bowdoin's disjointed play.</p>
      <p>It was evident during the second half, however, that the first period 
        was not an accurate representation of the players skill, as cuts and passes 
        improved, leading to the tying goal 20 minutes into the second half. Bobby 
        Desilets '05 crossed to Bresnehan who settled the ball with a header and 
        ripped a scissor kick off one bounce that was hotter than his red hair. 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Bobby played a great ball to me and I was just able to put it on 
        net and got lucky,&quot; said a modest Bresnehan '05. While Bresnehan 
        downplayed his goal, it sent the Polar Bear loyals into a frenzy and drew 
        praise from fourth-year coach Brian Ainscough who said that Bresnehan 
        showed &quot;great agility for a big man.&quot;</p>
      <p>While it was the &quot;big man&quot; who tied the game, the game-winning 
        goal came off the foot of the smallest Polar Bear, Tucker Hodgkins '05. 
        Just over a minute into overtime, Hodgkins tapped in the game winner past 
        Wheaton keeper Matt Pachniuk. Like Bresnehan, Hodgkins was quick to credit 
        luck while referring to his goal, &quot;The ball just found my foot, and 
        I was able to put it in the net. There's nothing better than an overtime 
        goal though.&quot;</p>
      <p>His goal was especially satisfying because it came in his first game 
        back in over a year, as Hodgkins was forced to sit out last season with 
        a knee injury. Ainscough said of his return, &quot;He was always part 
        of the team last year, as he was always there, but it's nice to have his 
        talent back on the field.&quot; </p>
      <p>Luck was not on Bowdoin's side throughout the entire game, however, as 
        star defensive stopper Danny Sullivan '05 will be lost for at least three 
        weeks because of a broken arm during play. Said Bresnehan, &quot;Sully 
        is a such big loss in the backfield, and we'll miss him. But Bucky Jencks 
        '05 did a great job filling in and first years Mike Hollis and Anthony 
        Regis also played great.&quot;</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this was not the only injury suffered by a Bowdoin player 
        during the contest. After scoring his goal, Hodgkins raced to the sidelines 
        and jumped on senior Joe Andrasko, who was then pinned under a pile of 
        celebrating Polar Bears. </p>
      <p>Said Hodgkins of the mauling, &quot;I didn't know if the referee was 
        going to give us the goal, but when he gave the signal I jumped on Joe 
        and then we got piled on. I felt bad though, because there was blood pouring 
        out of his nose.&quot; While Andrasko was unavailable for comment, no 
        assault charges are expected against Hodgkins, and Andrasko will most 
        likely be medically cleared to be in attendance this Saturday when the 
        Wesleyan Cardinals visit to kick off the NESCAC season.</p>
      <p>Said Ainscough, &quot;We have an awful lot of returning players, which 
        bodes well, and we're confident going into the NESCAC season. We're still 
        a young team, but we're more seasoned this year.&quot; Come watch these 
        seasoned veterans and talented newcomers at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday on the 
        fields behind Farley.<br>
