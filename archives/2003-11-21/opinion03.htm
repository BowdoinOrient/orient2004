      <p align="left"><font size="5">Redeeming reality and "Queer Eye's" outpost of decency</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">PAT ROCKEFELLER<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">When historians look back at the fall of Western civilization they will note that it rotted from the inside. Our debates on free speech are not about newspaper editors criticizing politicians, but as to whether digitally produced kiddy porn is protected under the First Amendment.  While it was once believed that we should aspire to be like our betters, today we wallow in the anti-glamour of reality television designed to glorify the worst of our traits.  Reality TV may have started with MTV's remarkably unrealistic, but relatively simple, "The Real World," but it soon degraded to the likes of "Temptation Island" and "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?"  So with expectations at an all time low, what are we presented with?  </p>
<p align="left">I'm tempted to call "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" 'fabulous,' but I won't.  I'll just say it's really good.  Seriously, it's a good show.  </p>
<p align="left">For those that haven't seen it, the premise is quite simple.  Five guys take over a slob's life for the day, transforming his wardrobe, and house, cleaning him up, and offering tips on grooming, cooking, wine and culture, usually with the goal of impressing a girlfriend or family at the end of the night.  </p>
<p align="left">The five guys (the "Fab 5") take a number of things into consideration when making their suggestions, and it would appear that a lot of research goes into their work.  If the slob is a surfer, they don't try to transform him into a Wall Street banker.  They don't take a normal guy and throw him into the world of high fashion, if for no other reason then they are aware of income restraints.  The idea is that all the changes are relatively simple and can be continued with minimal hassle and cost-a new hair product or what constitutes the minimum required for a decent wardrobe.  The end results are always impressive and never overwhelming.  </p>
<p align="left">The catch of course-what makes this show different than Trading Places or a variety of makeover shows-is that the Fab 5 are gay, and the slob is straight.  This has raised a few overly sensitive eyebrows amongst those who say depicting gay men as fashionable and cultured, with a wit as sharp as their style only goes to reinforce stereotypes and promote differences.  Yeah, well...maybe.  But those who really feel that all homosexuals are the same dandy-man light-in-the-loafers type aren't the ones watching the show.  I am.   </p>
<p align="left">The fact that the Fab 5 are gay is the lure-it's what initially attracts the viewers and separates the show from all the others.  What keeps the viewers watching is that there is some substance to it all.  When the show was put together the producers (one gay, one straight) were looking for experts in five fields.  Carson covers fashion, Kyan does grooming, Ted is the food and wine expert, Jai is the culture man, and Thom is the interior decorator.  Their tips and the changes they make are not intended to 'feminize' or 'convert' the straight guys, but to give them a little class.  </p>
<p align="left">That's also the redeeming value of this show and what separates it from all the other faux-reality crap out there.  The purpose of Temptation Island was to take normal people and debase them-to get them to shed all dignity and values and cheat on their boy/girlfriend to entertain the audience.  If someone cried, that was all the better.  </p>
<p align="left">The purpose of "Queer Eye" is to take someone who lacks style, etiquette, or cooking skills, and build him up and give him a sense of confidence.  </p>
<p align="left">There was an episode recently where the Fab 5 made over a guy who was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  He wasn't a complete slob, but his girlfriend was much more cultured and sophisticated.  He was a bit of an urban cowboy, born in rural Virginia, but living in New York City.  The idea was to give him the confidence that comes with a bit of self improvement.  They fixed him up, while respecting who he was and where he came from.  They bought him some new clothes, gave him some cooking lessons, and redesigned the interior of his apartment to make it look less like a college dorm and more like a home.  Now, as a matter of principle, I generally root against anyone who makes a public display of their life for cameras and reality TV shows.  But when this guy asked his girlfriend to marry him, I made an exception.  </p>
<p align="left">The show is fun. The show is witty.  The show is constructive.  It builds on existing interpersonal relationships instead of forcing random people to hook up, while trying to rip other couples apart.  It shows that we can learn from others and improve ourselves.  It intends to elevate and not to denigrate.  For that reason it stands in stark opposition to the prevailing winds of our culture.  </p>
<p align="left">It would be foolish to overstate the importance of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."  In the end it's just another television show which will probably fade out within a couple seasons, but in the meantime, it can be said that it is an outpost of decency and hope in the otherwise ugly world of reality TV. </p>
