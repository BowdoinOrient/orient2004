      <p align="left"> Last Saturday night, Augusta Civic Center was host to the 
        most unusual concert I've ever seen. As hordes of disciples looked on, 
        Tool took the stage in the darkness to play their peculiar and cerebral 
        brand of metal. The band, which is among the strangest and most musically 
        talented in rock's mainstream (where they are only located because of 
        the size of their cult), put on a hell of a performance, supplemented 
        by a visual show that will not be easily forgotten.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Guitarist Adam Jones puts his art background to good use in the band's 
        spooky claymation videos for songs like &quot;Sober,&quot; &quot;Stinkfist,&quot; 
        and &quot;Prison Sex.&quot; Live, all of Tool's songs are accompanied 
        by original videos put together by Jones, displayed on giant screens at 
        either side of the stage. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;H.&quot; featured serpents eating themselves in circles, while the 
        visual accompaniment for &quot;Lateralus&quot; let the audience &quot;ride 
        the spiral&quot; as the song's lyrics say. Though the actual videos for 
        &quot;Stinkfist&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; were incorporated into 
        their presentations, the groundbreaking &quot;Sober&quot; video was abandoned 
        in favor of new and equally disturbing imagery, some involving an eyeball. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tool's stage presence was particularly unique. Vocalist Maynard James 
        Keenan simply didn't face the audience, but stayed in the background, 
        silhouetted against the backdrop, dancing around in an almost Bono-esque 
        fashion but singing with his back or side to the crowd, not engaging the 
        audience directly, instead letting the music do that for him. The spotlight 
        was more on drummer Danny Carey than anyone else, and deservingly so, 
        as Carey pulled off a Herculean task in anchoring the band during ultra-percussive 
        epic songs for nearly two hours. Jones and bassist Justin Chancellor also 
        put enormous amounts of energy into the show, forming the songs that Keenan, 
        one of rock's most gifted singers, wrapped his voice around to create 
        something dark and beautiful. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I missed the opening act, Swedish metal group Meshuggah, due to horrendous 
        traffic, but they must have played a fairly short set, because I didn't 
        realize it until a ring of flaming eyes, artwork from Tool's latest album 
        Lateralus, appeared on the screens and the noise began. A short instrumental 
        off that album, &quot;Eon Blue Apocalypse,&quot; could be distinguished 
        among the noise before the band broke into &quot;Sober,&quot; their first 
        hit, off 1993's Undertow. This was the oldest song presented that evening, 
        nothing from the debut EP Opiate was played, while Lateralus was played 
        nearly in its entirety. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tool followed &quot;Sober&quot; with &quot;The Grudge,&quot; the epic 
        first track on Lateralus, complete with Maynard's scream near the end 
        which lasts an impossible 25 seconds (it wasn't quite that long live, 
        but pretty close and pretty incredible). &quot;Stinkfist,&quot; &quot;H.,&quot; 
        &quot;Schism,&quot; &quot;Parabol&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; wowed 
        the crowd before the set-ending &quot;&AElig;nema,&quot; a jarring prayer 
        for a watery apocalypse and a highlight of the evening.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Tool's encore break was as unique as anything about them - the crowd was 
        blasting with a wave of bass for about ten minutes as the set was changed. 
        When the band returned, they played &quot;Disposition,&quot; &quot;Reflection,&quot; 
        and &quot;Triad,&quot; which together form a suite of about 22 minutes 
        long which ends Lateralus; an excellent performance. Meshuggah's drummer 
        came out to help on the instrumental &quot;Triad;&quot; still, the song, 
        lacking the &quot;machines&quot; that contribute to the album track, was 
        the least fleshed-out of the night.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Maynard addressed the crowd politely before the last song, thanking them 
        for sharing the evening. &quot;We hope we've left you inspired as well 
        as extremely horny. Go home, sit by a nice fire, write some poetry, and 
        masturbate 'till you pass out. Film it and send it to us.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tool closed with the title track from their latest album, perhaps the 
        best song in their catalogue, and perhaps the finest performance of the 
        night, sending us home satisfied. I've seen many of the biggest rock acts 
        of the last decade, and I'd say that Tool puts on the second best show 
        I've ever seen, second only to U2. </p>
