        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> My friend Rory doesn't like Bowdoin College. His reasons 
        are very simple. He thinks that Bowdoin is nothing more than a group of 
        WARTS. W-hite A-mbivalent R-ich T-anked S-tudents. He says that WARTS 
        lack motivation. Maybe it comes from the alcohol or maybe it comes from 
        the suburban upbringing? Anyway, he says that Bowdoin students actively 
        pursue &quot;lacking motivation&quot; by separating themselves from the 
        world. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This can't be true. After all, Bowdoin students must be in touch with 
        the world. Why, we have one of the best vegan cafeterias in the country. 
        Our student body is perfectly in touch with the cast from Leave it to 
        Beaver. And the political discourse rivals Cody, Wyoming in intensity. 
        Not that I don't think someone should fight &quot;the man&quot; about 
        the never-ending supply of black bean tacos, but I would rather address 
        politics. </p>
      <p align="left">It is that time of they year, or should I say every two 
        years, where the balance of power in Congress is up for grabs. Not that 
        we haven't fought a war, seen the economy go to hell, alienated every 
        other country (save Israel) in the world, or put up with two years of 
        rule by the Governor of Texas, but maybe now its time for change. Maybe 
        one of these things could break the Bowdoin bubble? But my research tells 
        me otherwise.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Talking to my friends recently has been disheartening. I can't believe 
        it. I have to agree with Rory. This is a low point of my life. You don't 
        care. What do you mean you don't care? That's not an answer. Shame on 
        you, really, SHAME. The general ambivalence is frightening. I know the 
        art of being a good Bowdoin student is copping out an answer, so I implore 
        you not to. &quot;My vote doesn't matter.&quot; Okay, wrong. If that armed 
        (which at one point many republicans in Miami were) robbery of Florida 
        two years ago didn't make you believe, then I am surprised you have made 
        it this far in the article. What else, what else? &quot;Oh, I don't have 
        time.&quot; Okay, wrong. I have seen how many of you read The Patriot. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        So no more excuses. I can't tell you who to vote for, but I can tell you 
        that it matters. There are some of us here, but more importantly millions 
        around the country, who depend on change in this election. Move yourselves 
        into the twenty-first century. Everyday the number of persons living in 
        poverty increases. Everyday, thousands of people around the country are 
        being evicted from their homes because of the past two years. Vote because 
        you have some understanding that there are people outside of our bubble 
        who are suffering. These are people you will never meet, but you can connect 
        with if you vote. There are people around this campus who care, so why 
        don't you prove it to me, prove it to yourselves maybe. Say it, &quot;We 
        will not be WARTS!&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        But if you ran away to Maine to go to college, to get away from the &quot;city&quot; 
        and &quot;life in general,&quot; your WARTness doesn't allow you to understand 
        this-so just vote Democrat for the hell of it. </p>
