        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> With funding secured and its design nearly set, the Bowdoin 
        College Board of Trustees has voted to begin construction on Kanbar Hall, 
        a new building to house the Psychology, Education, and Academic Skills 
        programs; at the northeast corner of campus in March of 2003.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;For a long time Bowdoin College has had a serious 
        need for a building to properly serve these important academic programs, 
        which touch every student who walks the Bowdoin campus,&quot; President 
        Barry Mills said.</p>
      <p align="left">Sandwiched between Sills and Cleaveland halls on the Cleaveland 
        Quad, Kanbar Hall will rise three stories above a full basement. The largest 
        tenant will be the Psychology department, followed by Education and the 
        Academic Skills programs, including the Baldwin Center for Learning and 
        Teaching, the Writing Project, and Quantitative Skills program.</p><p align="left">
        Kanbar Hall will feature a 50-seat lecture hall, a seminar classroom, 
        a 24-hour computer lab, and ample informal study spaces, in addition to 
        program-specific labs and office space for the three tenants. </p><p align="left">
        Common areas will be scattered throughout the building. &quot;There will 
        be spaces for students to congregate and talk informally with the chance 
        of a faculty member stopping by and chatting,&quot; said Professor Louisa 
        Slowiaczek, chair of the psychology department and a building committee 
        member. Slowiaczek said the building will foster a &quot;sense of camaraderie 
        between students and professors in the department and encourage a sense 
        of community.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        The architects and planning committee decided on a three-story brick structure 
        defined by a large glass entrance space and a glass wall that stretches 
        across the corner of the second and third floors facing campus. The cost 
        was chopped down to $8.75 million because the college budget reportedly 
        could not accommodate earlier plans for a &quot;signature building,&quot; 
        and proposals for an elaborate curving glass front were scrapped to cut 
        costs. </p><p align="left">
        &quot;The interesting thing about the building,&quot; said Bill Torrey, 
        Senior Vice President for Planning and Development, &quot;is that there 
        is not really a back side to it. We wanted a face to the town&quot; that 
        connected the campus with the community. </p><p align="left">
        Designed by Cambridge Seven Associates, the structure is to be angled 
        into the space so that it maximizes sightlines and spares several trees 
        near Bath Road, including the Kellogg Tree, the oldest tree on campus. 
        The first floor of the building will be T-shaped but only the leg of the 
        T will extend above the first floor. </p><p align="left">
        Cambridge Seven also designed the award-winning addition to Searles Hall. 
        &quot;We chose them because they did an innovative job with Searles and 
        know that end of campus well. They did a fine job of putting all of the 
        component parts [in the new building] together,&quot; said Torrey. </p><p align="left">
        The building's name, Kanbar Hall, recognizes the Kanbar Charitable Trust, 
        which furnished the lead gift for the structure. Elliott Kanbar, a New 
        York businessman and 1956 Bowdoin graduate, is part owner of Skyy Spirits, 
        was a founder and partner of the $5-A-Day/Arthur Frommer group of travel 
        companies, and was founder and chairman of General Mortgage Corporation. 
        </p><p align="left">
        The Neuroscience program will occupy the basement. The first floor will 
        feature classrooms, a computer laboratory, and offices for the Education 
        department and Academic Skills programs. Psychology laboratories, classrooms, 
        and office space, a kitchen, and informal lounges will fill the second 
        and third floors. </p><p align="left">
        The largest tenant will be the psychology program. &quot;I don't know 
        what superlative adjectives to use to convey how excited I am about this 
        new space,&quot; said Slowiaczek, the psychology department chair. The 
        new building &quot;really allows us to expand, grow, and develop in the 
        work that we are doing at all levels. The length of time Psychology has 
        been in the current space [Banister Hall] has led some people to question 
        how the program is valued but I think the promise of this new space is 
        somewhat inspiring,&quot; she said. The psychology and neuroscience departments 
        will gain a wet lab and experiment observation stations that feature two-way 
        mirrors facing rooms on either side. &quot;We are particularly excited 
        to have space that is deliberately designed for what we need to do,&quot; 
        she said. &quot;The new facilities will raise the psychology and neuroscience 
        programs to a new level.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        A new academic support center will cover part of the first floor. Ample 
        new conference space will eliminate the need for writing and math tutors 
        to meet in the Caf&eacute; and across campus, said Kathleen O'Connor, 
        Director of the Writing Project. &quot;The building will bring the academic 
        support programs together and make them more visible,&quot; she said, 
        noting that the programs are currently scattered across campus in Sills 
        and Searles Halls. O'Connor hopes the connections between the three programs 
        and the three departments in the building can enhance learning opportunities 
        across disciplines. &quot;We don't work as closely as we might,&quot; 
        she said. The glass walls will also give the program a sense of openness, 
        which, according to O'Connor, might make coming in to the Baldwin Center 
        or one of the peer tutoring programs less intimidating.</p><p align="left">
        The education department will move to the new building from Ashby House. 
        &quot;It will be wonderful that the education department will be moving 
        back to the heart of the campus,&quot; Nancy Jennings, department chair 
        and building committee member, said in a statement. &quot;We're also looking 
        forward to sharing space with psychology and the academic skills programs. 
        This proximity will facilitate collaboration and the sharing of ideas 
        among our students and colleagues.&quot; </p><p align="left">
        An eight member building committee, comprised of senior administrators 
        and faculty representatives, worked with the architects on the final designs. 
        Originally planned for the site directly north of Massachusetts Hall on 
        Bath Road, the planning committee decided to move the location to the 
        larger space on Cleaveland Quad. The chosen space is bordered by Sills 
        Drive and Bath Road.</p><p align="left">
        Torrey, the planning administrator, said that along with Kanbar Hall, 
        construction will begin this spring on the chapel to restore the spires. 
        &quot;We are also looking closely at the art museum,&quot; he said in 
        terms of remodeling. Renovating the first year dorms and the hockey rink 
        are the next projects on the horizon. &quot;We are still in the fund raising 
        stage,&quot; said Torrey.</p>
