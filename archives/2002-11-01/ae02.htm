      <p align="left"> The other week, I was hanging out with my ex-roommate, 
        talking about music as usual. He said that Guns n' Roses was better than 
        Nirvana. Without thinking, as some sort of twisted instinctual reaction, 
        I kicked him square in the balls. Within seconds, I was apologizing profusely. 
        I didn't mean to do it, but Nirvana means a lot to me. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I've come to the realization that Nirvana may be my all-time favorite 
        band. I actually completely missed them when Kurt Cobain was alive and 
        became aware of our generation's lost hero by the t-shirts kids wore before 
        I started listening to music in 1996. For a while, too, I preferred Kurt's 
        sometimes evil wife Courtney Love's band Hole to his own. Then I bought 
        Nevermind. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nevermind is Nirvana's first masterpiece. It's not the second-best album 
        of all time, as claimed by nearly every list made in the past few years. 
        But it's pretty damn good. You should all own it; its sequel In Utero, 
        Kurt's sick, vicious reaction to the sudden fame; and MTV Unplugged in 
        New York, the posthumous release of Kurt's most intimate performance. 
        While In Utero (especially on tracks like &quot;Scentless Apprentice,&quot; 
        &quot;Rape Me,&quot; and &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot;) recorded 
        a raw assault on the senses to build to some kind of catharsis, the boys 
        of Nirvana had to strip away the noise for their MTV Unplugged session, 
        and were left with the torn emotion in Kurt's voice and a guitar (and 
        an accordion and some cellos). </p>
      <p align="left">
        Cobain is alive, and kicking, on all Nirvana's songs. His life, chronicled 
        in Charles R. Cross's excellent biography Heavier Than Heaven last year, 
        was never particularly stable, but was complete chaos during the 90s with 
        the advent of fame and heroin addiction. Cobain didn't have that deep 
        a musical background when he started Nirvana, and &quot;Smells Like Teen 
        Spirit&quot; wasn't the most original song of all time, Cobain even claimed 
        he was ripping off the Pixies with it. But it had amazing grabbing power 
        from the opening strums, an undeniable urgency. Nirvana was very lucky 
        at the exact right time. The underground exploded and mainstream music 
        suddenly had made its greatest change since maybe Elvis. A glorious period 
        of &quot;alternative rock&quot; was started, and until 1998 or 1999, there 
        were a lot of awesome bands in the mainstream. Then the current dark period 
        descended as Fred Durst and Kid Rock became the new heroes of the nation's 
        youth. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kurt Cobain shot himself in the head in early April 1994; his body was 
        found on April 8. The previous month he had purposely overdosed on tour 
        in Italy and was furious at doctors for resuscitating him. In January, 
        Cobain had showed up to the last of three scheduled recording days and 
        the band cut his last song, &quot;You Know You're Right.&quot; Love blocked 
        the release of a planned Nirvana box set because she wanted to release 
        the song, a potential hit single in her mind, on a single-disc greatest 
        hits album, which could sell millions of copies. After years of squabbles 
        between Love and Nirvana's surviving members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, 
        Courtney got her way.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is the reason to buy Nirvana, released 
        Tuesday also containing 13 other &quot;hits.&quot; The truth is that Courtney 
        was right. Even if Nirvana doesn't sell millions, the song is atop Billboard's 
        Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts and all over radio. Eight and a 
        half years beyond the grave, Cobain blows everything else out of the water. 
        The song is both spooky and totally catchy as Kurt sings the twistingly 
        ironic line &quot;things have never been so swell.&quot; The chorus is 
        the word &quot;pain,&quot; howled, repeated. It's incredible, and the 
        only songs on the album that are better than it are &quot;Smells Like 
        Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;About A Girl.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Nirvana is a fun album. Most of the fans already own everything on it 
        except &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; (&quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; is 
        presented as in a remixed version to make it a little sweeter). This is 
        designed for beginners. I would recommend Nevermind as a better starting 
        point, personally. Go for the original. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Now that the prize rarity has been unearthed, the path is cleared for 
        the box set. There are plenty of great tunes not found on Nirvana albums. 
        You could wait for the set, or many of them are floating around online. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kurt Cobain was the savior of rock and roll. Hell, he even looked like 
        Jesus Christ. If you don't listen to Nirvana, you're missing something 
        in your life. Dig in.</p>
