      <p align="left">Take 20 guys, 9 girls, one disc, and a Sunday afternoon 
        and what you'll have is the Bates Ultimate Invitational. As the day progressed, 
        it became clear that the host was overmatched by Bowdoin's Chaos Theory 
        and Stoned Clown co-ed combinations. </p><p align="left">
        Overall, the &quot;A&quot; team left the tournament with a 3-1 record, 
        beating out Bates Alumni Team, University of New England, and Brandeis. 
        Their only blemish came in the championship match against Junk of Pork, 
        a Portland based all-star team. The &quot;B&quot; team also had a strong 
        day, leaving with a 2-2 record and presenting strong challenges to the 
        Bates and University of Maine Farmington's &quot;A&quot; teams.</p><p align="left">
        Despite the overall success of the co-ed teams, the message from the men 
        was clear: the day's victories could not be won without the help of the 
        women. </p><p align="left">
        &quot;The ladies came up big in what might have been an intimidating setting&#133;they 
        were our secret weapon,&quot; said senior men's captain Alex &quot;Throat&quot; 
        Rosati '03.</p><p align="left">
        &quot;We couldn't have done it without the ladies. They made great cuts 
        and the games we won were because of them,&quot; said &quot;B&quot; team 
        leader Kurt &quot;Cletus&quot; Jendrek '04.</p><p align="left">
        And the women took the men's compliments with predictable grace and returned 
        their appreciation with equal eloquence.</p><p align="left">
        &quot;The women are lucky to have such a great bunch of guys to play with 
        at these co-ed tournaments. Not only are they incredibly talented, but 
        they are also sensitive to the fact that our team is young and, for the 
        most part, novice. More than anything else, the men's patience and encouragement 
        is responsible for the successful launch of the new women's team,&quot; 
        said women's team captain Anjali &quot;Trinity&quot; Dotson '04.</p><p align="left">
        One of the day's best plays came from Vanessa &quot;Holster&quot; Lind 
        '06, who laid out for the disc on the sidelines, landing in/on the Stoned 
        Clown ceremonial chair. Tough play also came from Grace Cho '05, who single-handedly 
        engineered the team's first point against UMF. Gritty defensive work from 
        Adam &quot;Heiman&quot; Ringle '04 in the championship match brought the 
        game within five points. </p><p align="left">
        Day-long first-year excellence abounded, showing itself particularly in 
        the play of Henry &quot;Sea-Bass&quot; Van Winkle Work '06, whose handling 
        and deep hucks were the toast of Lewiston. His favorite targets, Mike 
        &quot;Snatch&quot; LoBiondo '06 (seven points in one match!), and Jesse 
        &quot;Sideshow&quot; McCree '06 showed why the team stayed &quot;good 
        enough&quot; all day long. Lydia &quot;IV&quot; Morrison '04 handled and 
        cut with equal skill, earning the praise of many spectators. </p><p align="left">
        No tournament comes without casualties, however, as junior captain Brendan 
        &quot;Bismark&quot; Dickinson's gutsy end zone bid left the star leader 
        with a mild concussion. On the B-side, Conor &quot;Stat&quot; Williams 
        took a tackle to the knee, which all but ended his day. It was later discovered 
        that he was laboring under the influence of infectious mononucleosis as 
        well, which will sideline him through the end of November. </p><p align="left">
        Truly, however, the day's events were a team affair, where both sides 
        made notable progress and did significant damage to their opponents. As 
        the sun faded in the waning Lewiston autumn afternoon, Clown and Theory 
        opponents found their own stars rapidly setting. </p><p align="left">
        Team cheers rocked the blustery air, intimidating even the most capable 
        opposition. The season rolls on with several tournaments in the upcoming 
        month for both Chaos and Clown. </p>
