        <font size="2">VINAY KASHYAP</font><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> On September 11 of last year, we were attacked by a highly 
        organized and determined group of terrorists who were acting on an ideology 
        so forceful and radical that they were willing to take the lives of thousands 
        of innocent civilians and themselves. Since then, we have attempted to 
        weed out some of the Al Quaeda cells with marginal success. In fact, recent 
        reports state Al Quaeda and other comparable terrorist groups are becoming 
        more powerful and dangerous. What our administration seems to have lost 
        sight of is that the same &quot;anti-western&quot; ideology that attacked 
        us on September 11 is still the prevalent threat today. If we continue 
        to move towards unilateral, pre-emptive action against Iraq, we will not 
        only be allowing the actual threat to survive, but we will also be perpetuating 
        it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If any of the readers were able to attend former Secretary Robert Reich's 
        speech last week, they would clearly remember how he introduced our new 
        global economy. He used as an example the fact that we no longer know 
        where our products come from as an example of this globalization. Many 
        times they are designed in one country, manufactured in another, and then 
        shipped all around the world to consumers. It is of the utmost importance 
        that we understand the correlation between our evolving global economy 
        and this new global threat. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A simple way to understand this comparison is by analyzing the dynamics 
        of September 11. We were attacked by 19 terrorists, born and raised all 
        over the Middle East, trained in Afghanistan and armed by the international 
        black market, with ties to numerous European cities, and funded by people 
        across many borders. Two distinct points must be recognized from September 
        11 and global events following. First of all, this &quot;threat&quot; 
        that spans borders cannot be denominated to a war against a single, seasoned, 
        despotic regime. Secondly, multilateral cooperation with nations all over 
        the world is the only chance we have to effectively defeat this threat. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Our current administration has set a divergent course in that we are not 
        only ignoring the prevalent threat, but our foreign policy is also actually 
        propagating it. Examples of the strength and prevalence of this anti-western 
        ideology can be seen in events occurring in all parts of the world since 
        September 11. Acts of violence, such as the Bali blast and the brutal 
        murder of a U.S diplomat in Jordan, are threatening our relations with 
        these regions. Political tides are changing as well in the already unstable 
        Middle East. We saw the election of a Muslim fundamentalist regime in 
        the Pakistani state bordering Kashmir. In Turkey (our only Muslim counterpart 
        in NATO), elections in November are expected to displace the current, 
        moderate (anti-Iraqi war) government with a more radical government with 
        known fundamentalist ties. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These political changes and heinous acts of violence are exactly what 
        the September 11 terrorists set out to create. Moderate Muslims around 
        the world are becoming radicalized with every step we take towards a war 
        with Iraq and with every nation that we spit on unilaterally. The streets 
        around the world are alive with this growing ideology and we seem to be 
        the fictitious ostrich that believes if we stick our head in the sand 
        and ignore the rest of the world we can in turn become invincible.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I fully understand well the realities of our foreign policy. I also understand 
        reciprocity and how it underlines every bilateral action we have ever 
        taken. But, this ideology I am clamoring over is alive and is spreading 
        like a virus throughout the world. We must recognize that the threat is 
        not Iraq firing biological weapons that we are not sure they have, can 
        launch, or even plan to use. Our nation must see that the snipers in our 
        backyard were acting along the same anti-western ideology that the September 
        11 terrorists were. Only then will we finally take our heads out of the 
        sand. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And looking around in disarray for someone to help us weed out the actual 
        threat, we will quickly become disheartened. </p>
      <p align="left">
        We will finally realize that multilateral action and globalization have 
        uses beyond promoting our economic self-interest. We will have wished 
        that we had given the U. N. and other nations around the world a fighting 
        chance to work with us. This is what matters; it has to do with the basic 
        respect for your neighbor (and believe me, today, they are all our neighbors). 
        The same respect that today we avert for pre-emptive, unilateral action 
        could very well be our great nation's ruinous flaw in years to come. </p>
