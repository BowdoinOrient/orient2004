      <p align="left">When asked if Little Egypt put on a good show last Saturday, 
        most students would probably say most definitely. When asked why Little 
        Egypt came on such short notice, Burgie Howard would probably answer Mos 
        Def. After all, it was Mos Def who was supposed to perform in Morrell 
        Lounge on Saturday, October 26. </p>
      <p align="left">
        According to a spokesperson at Concert Ideas, a company that works as 
        an intermediary between colleges and artists, Mos Def was stuck in New 
        York last weekend filming a movie. Though they were unable to specify 
        exactly what he was working on, it is likely that the film is called The 
        Italian Job, a gangster movie currently in production in New York. The 
        film stars Mark Wahlberg, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, 
        and Donald Sutherland as well as Mos Def whose character is called &quot;Half 
        Ear.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mos Def is no newcomer to film. He has appeared in half a dozen movies 
        along with numerous television performances and has also starred in several 
        made for TV movies. His most notable performances were last year's Monster's 
        Ball, a film in which he played the character of Ryrus Cooper. Mos Def 
        also appeared in Spike Lee's Bamboozled as Mau Mau. He made regular guest 
        appearances on NYPD Blue several years ago and had a leading role in 1988's 
        God Bless the Child, a film made for TV. It would be easy to miss his 
        names in the credits, however, because back then he used the name Dante 
        Terrel Smith and sometimes the name Smith Dante.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Recently, Mos Def has moved to the stage. Though many actors find it difficult 
        to move from film to live theater, Mos Def had little difficulty. Evidence 
        of this can be found in a listing of last year's Tony Award Nominations. 
        Mos Def was nominated for best actor for his work in the play Top Dog/Underdog, 
        a play that started its run on Broadway in April, 2002. Written by Suzan-Lori 
        Parks, the play is a dark comedy about two African American brothers named 
        Lincoln and Booth. Top Dog/Underdog was nominated for Best Play but did 
        not win. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On top of his achievements in the world of acting, Mos Def is better known 
        for his career as a rapper. Before releasing his highly successful solo 
        album Black on Both Sides in 1999, Mos Def formed half of Black Star, 
        a group that allowed him to collaborate with rapper Talib Kweli. As socially 
        conscious rappers, the two were committed to creating a sound that was 
        different from most popular rap at the time.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, the Bowdoin community did not hear any of that rap, as 
        Mos Def was unable to perform last weekend. Luckily he will be coming 
        back in February but for now Bowdoin hip-hop fans have been satisfied 
        with another socially conscious rap group: Little Egypt. The group hails 
        from Brooklyn, New York and has released two cds entitled Sunrise and 
        Straight Out the Sands. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Little Egypt has four members: Visual Poetics, the Dominator, Taajwar, 
        Khordz-255, and the Dutchmaster, aka Bravestar. According to their website, 
        www.littleegypt-ny.com, Visual Poetics is the executive producer and leader 
        of the group. His inspiration was hip-hop's old-school renaissance in 
        the late 80s &quot;when hip-hop was real and meant something.&quot; He 
        also wants to give &quot;incredible insight into the present and future&quot; 
        as well. Rakim-Allah and KRS-One also influenced the rapper, who talks 
        about both on the group's website.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bravestar talks about himself on this site as well saying that he is a 
        fan of what he calls raw hip-hop. &quot;Listening to raw hip-hop uplifts 
        and inspires me,&quot; he says. &quot;It makes me go out and try to create 
        what will do the same for others.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Last Saturday, Little Egypt performed before a relatively small crowd. 
        Bowdoin's own DJ Marquee performed at the event as well. Marc Mendoza 
        '05, as he is known off stage, said of the group, &quot;Little Egypt got 
        the crowd hyped and they had a good message, unlike commercial bubble-gum 
        rap. I definitely reccommend people to go out and buy their album and 
        take a listen to some conscious hip-hop.&quot; The group was followed 
        by Bates musician Versatyle who, according to Mendoza, &quot;rocked the 
        crowd by himself, no hype man, jus' himself and the mic.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin's poeting team also lended their lyrical talents to Saturday night's 
        show. Though Mos Def was missed, the display of talent in Morrell Gym 
        did not lack in quality. The performers might not have received Tony nominations 
        for their work, but they definitely got the thumbs up of the Bowdoin community.
