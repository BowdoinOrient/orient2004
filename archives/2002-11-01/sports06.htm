        is the final chance for both the coed and women's team to qualify for 
        the Atlantic Coast Championship. The sailors plan on practicing hard throughout 
        the week in preparation. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Women's team, led by senior skippers Laura Windecker and Allison Binkowski, 
        qualified for the championship last year and certainly hope repeat the 
        feat by sailing fast this weekend with their crews Caitlin Moore '06 and 
        Jackie Haskell '05 respectively. </p><p align="left">
        This week's Senior Sailing Spotlight will focus on the sailing careers 
        and aspirations of Bowdoin's top women skippers. </p>
      <p>Interview with Laura Windecker '03</p><p align="left">
        Hi Laura! From your outstanding performances in top regattas, one would 
        imagine that you have had a lot of sailing experience. When did you initially 
        begin your sailing career?</p><p align="left">
        My father taught my sister and me how to sail in a small wooden Turnabout 
        on a lake in Maine at our family's summerhouse when I was quite young. 
        When I was 12, I went to summer camp and when I came home, all I talked 
        about was sailing. The following summer, my mother enrolled me in sailing 
        lessons at a local club in New Jersey, by the time I was 15, I bought 
        my own used Laser with help from my parents, and I haven't stopped sailing 
        since. </p><p align="left">
        Can you explain a bit more about your experiences sailing Lasers and how 
        they impacted your sailing at Bowdoin?</p><p align="left">
        Lasers, 14 foot single-handed racing boats, are the most commonly single-handed 
        [meaning a boat designed for one person] racing boats in the country. 
        I raced a Laser Radial, a Laser with a bit smaller sail, used mostly by 
        women and junior sailors throughout high school. I practiced mostly on 
        Barnegat Bay, New Jersey and often I would be the only girl practicing 
        on a given day. I was able to travel to regattas in Florida, New York 
        and Canada with the Jersey Shore Youth Team and earned valuable racing 
        experience. As a senior, I sometimes wonder how I sailed by myself for 
        so many years because working together as a team with someone often allows 
        you to sail faster and it's usually more fun!</p><p align="left">
        So what is your job as a skipper in a Bowdoin Lark, a double-handed boat?</p><p align="left">
        Basically, my job as skipper is to control the tiller [what steers the 
        boat] and the mainsail while my crew controls the jib [the smaller front 
        sail]. However, during a race, we both need to focus on how fast the boat 
        is moving and where our boat is on the racecourse. </p><p align="left">
        Tell me about NEISA, the college sailing league. </p><p align="left">
        NEISA [New England Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association] is sailing's 
        version of the NCAA. Any school, regardless of size in New England sails 
        in this league. On any given weekend, our team will sail in regattas against 
        schools such as Tufts, Harvard, Yale or Dartmouth. At most regattas, each 
        school sends four people, 2 for A division and 2 for B division. Traditionally, 
        NEISA is the most competitive league of the ICSA [Inter-Collegiate Sailing 
        Association] in the country. </p><p align="left">
        Thinking back on your entire sailing career, what is your most memorable 
        experience?</p><p align="left">
        I think it's impossible to have a single memorable experience. Getting 
        &quot;Top Women Skipper&quot; at Laser Radial Nationals when I was 17 
        was a great experience and all those days on Barnegat Bay were great too. 
        Meeting people from all over the country has been wonderful and of course, 
        sailing here at Bowdoin has been fantastic. Our team is full of great 
        people and we get to sail at one of the most beautiful sailing sites in 
        the country almost every weekday! </p>
      <p>Interview with </p><p align="left">
        Allie Binkowski '03</p><p align="left">
        Hi Allie! Tell me about your initial sailing experiences.</p><p align="left">
        I grew up on Lake Mendota in Wisconsin and spent most of my childhood 
        hours in or on the water. My dad first taught me how to sail when I was 
        really young but I didn't start racing until high school when my neighbor, 
        one of the best Midwest sailors, took me under his wing and taught me 
        how to race. I ended up sailing with him for seven summers and learning 
        a lot in the process. </p><p align="left">
        How do you think your sailing career has impacted your experience at Bowdoin 
        and outlook on life?</p><p align="left">
        Sailing has given me the opportunity to see a lot of the East Coast and 
        get to know people from other schools. At Bowdoin, sailing has really 
        given me a sense of belonging because the Sailing Team is extremely close. 
        Being able to get out on the ocean every day and sail around lobster pots 
        and seals while the sun sets is a pretty nice bonus too!</p><p align="left">
        Wow, it seems like sailing is a great experience, but a heavy time commitment. 
        Describe a normal week of sailing and how weekend regattas work.</p><p align="left">
        We practice Tuesday through Friday from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. and race every 
        weekend, a huge time commitment of over 40 hours a week. As a team, we 
        participate in three to five regattas every weekend and are able to travel 
        across New England. The farthest away we generally sail is the Navel Academy 
        in Annapolis and the closest is Boston. The time is worth it to me because 
        I enjoy sailing so much. The freedom of being out on the water and using 
        nothing but the wind to go wherever you want is such an amazing feeling 
        that it's hard to describe. </p><p align="left">
        So how do you enjoy being on the Women's Team? Any notable experiences 
        from the past few years?</p><p align="left">
        My favorite moment was when we first read the rankings that said we were 
        thirteenth in the nation and my second favorite moment was winning A division 
        at a major intersectional regatta at Tufts last year. In addition, almost 
        nothing could beat qualifying for ACCs last year-I guess you could say 
        that I am a little competitive. </p><p align="left">
        What are your goals for the remainder of your college sailing career and 
        beyond?</p><p align="left">
        This upcoming weekend we are racing at the Victorian Urn Trophy at Harvard. 
        Our goal is to get top 6 so that we can qualify for ACCs. Looking at the 
        rest of the season as a whole, the Women's Team goal is to be ranked top 
        10 in the nation. Sailing is unique in that everything is Division I, 
        so top 10 would be an amazing accomplishment. In addition, sailing is 
        one of those sports that can last for one's whole life, and I have no 
        doubt that my passion for sailing and love of the water will continue 
        after college. </p><p align="left">
        Any thoughts for younger sailors thinking to join the team or learn how 
        to sail?</p><p align="left">
        The sailing team is very unique in that we are a Division I varsity sport 
        yet do not require participants to have any experience upon joining. We 
        are always looking for more sailors. So anyone athletic and committed 
        and looking for a great team to join is welcome!</p>
      <p>Sailing update!</p><p align="left">
        In other Bowdoin College sailing news, the Polar Bears sailed to victory 
        this past weekend at UNH's Eastern Series VI. The Eastern Series team 
        was led by Eddie Briganti '05 who sailed with Kendall Brown '06 and Emily 
        Bruns '06 who sailed with Ellen Grenely '06, aided by Roberto Hernandez 
        '06. </p><p align="left">
        However, the other Bowdoin teams had a tough weekend, and struggled through 
        the pouring rain. At Brown's Hoyt Trophy intersectional, the coed team, 
        comprised of Tyler Dunphy '03 who sailed with Melanie Keene '03 and Ryan 
        Cauley '03 who sailed with Amy Titcomb '04 did not sail as fast as possible, 
        finding themselves completing a lot of protest spins and hacking it up 
        at the starts. </p><p align="left">
        However they will get back in their fast mode for this weekend's qualifier 
        for the ACC Tournament at the Navel Academy that will be hosted at MIT. 
        </p><p align="left">
        Last week's other regattas included the Women's Stu Nelson Trophy at Connecticut 
        College, where they placed 13th overall, and the Wellahan Trophy at USM. 
        </p><p align="left">
        The Wellahan sailors consisted of &quot;The Belgian,&quot; Pieter Scheerlinck 
        '05 who sailed with Sophie Wiss '06, and Frank Pizzo '06 who sailed with 
        Sabrina Hall-Little '06 and Eddie Briganti '05. </p><p align="left">
        While their final ranking was not stellar, these sailors fought through 
        the dreary weather, battled with tough Mass Maritime sailors, and learned 
        more about the 420-styled boats. </p>
