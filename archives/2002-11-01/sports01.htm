        <font size="2">BECKY TANENBAUM</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Anyone who has ventured out to a field hockey game has 
        surely seen Mike O'Neill '04 and Mike Stevens '04 working their magic 
        from behind the officials' desk. For their unbridled dedication to the 
        field hockey program, the Orient bestows upon Mike O'Neill and Mike Stevens 
        this week's Fans-of-the-Week award.</p>
      <p align="left">This season marks the third time that O'Neill and Stevens 
        have worked at field hockey games. Stevens shared the intense hiring process 
        for the position with the Orient: &quot;We submitted our resumes to coach 
        Lynn Ruddy, Assistant Athletic Director and Chief Executive Officer of 
        Field Hockey operations. Following an intensive interview process, we 
        got the job. This was after a screen of our criminal records. Records 
        which obviously were absolutely clean.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        Keeping track of the score and statistics as well as running the sidelines 
        are just a few of O'Neill and Stevens' many responsibilities. Before the 
        games, they watch the opposing players warm-up in order to assess the 
        situation. &quot;We want to see who could be dangerous,&quot; O'Neill 
        said. &quot;We try to see what kind of talent is there.&quot; </p><p align="left">
        A highlight of the games for the fans-of-the-week is the opportunity to 
        see their favorite players in action. Stevens noted Leah McClure '03 as 
        one of his favorite players. &quot;We're from the same great Canadian 
        province of New Brunswick so I can identify with her on that level,&quot; 
        he said and then added referring to his own skills on the ice hockey rink, 
        &quot;Also, she scores a lot and I score a lot so we have that in common 
        too.&quot; </p><p align="left">
        O'Neill and Stevens spoke about Gillian McDonald '04 who they believe 
        is the top goalie in the NESCAC. Stevens also mentioned Britney Carr '04 
        as a multi-dimensional player. Two of the fans' favorite players, O'Neill 
        and Faye Hargate '04, referred to Carr as a defensive stalwart.</p><p align="left">
        The players also recognize O'Neill and Stevens' dedication to field hockey. 
        Britney Carr shared her thoughts with the Orient: &quot;Mike and Mike 
        are amazing fans. They are always there before the team arrives and they 
        really know how to get us pumped up for the game. Stevens does a great 
        job announcing the line-up and the goals. As for O'Neill, he counts down 
        the last minute better than anyone I have ever seen. I also want to mention 
        that they are very supportive when you get a yellow card. They definitely 
        deserve to be fans-of-the-week.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        Field Hockey has provided O'Neill and Stevens with great memories and 
        with much to look forward to in the future. &quot;The first time we saw 
        the talented Trinity Field Hockey Team was a great memory,&quot; Stevens 
        said. Nodding his head in agreement, O'Neill continued, &quot;And we're 
        eager to meet them again in the playoffs when Bowdoin will hopefully host 
        the NESCAC tournament.&quot; </p><p align="left">
        They are also eagerly anticipating the end of the year field hockey banquet 
        at Benzoni's. &quot;We've been neglected at the banquet these past few 
        years. We paid our dues to the program and we deserve an invitation,&quot; 
        Stevens emphasized. </p><p align="left">
        Throughout the interview, the fans-of-the-week constantly stressed the 
        importance of the people they work with. &quot;We are where we are today 
        because of the people we have working with us and for us,&quot; O'Neill 
        said. &quot;You're only as good as the people you work with.&quot; </p><p align="left">
        Stevens specifically mentioned several people who are essential to the 
        field hockey program. &quot;We would like to thank Coach Jaime Dumont. 
        Although at times he can get annoyed with us, he does a great job and 
        he is a good administrator.&quot; O'Neill and Stevens also spoke about 
        Jim Canton without whom, they said, they would not be able to do their 
        jobs. </p><p align="left">
        O'Neill and Stevens were quick to mention Bowdoin football's fans-of-the-week, 
        Scott Brien and John Gregory, as role models. &quot;We are truly flattered 
        to be put in the same company as Scott and John,&quot; Stevens said with 
        a tone of admiration. &quot;They are a very special breed of fan and they 
        bring an element of energy and excitement to every game they go to. We 
        try to follow the example they set.&quot; O'Neill, inspired by Brien and 
        Gregory's cheer-writing skills, has been working on his own cheer which 
        he promised to debut at the field hockey banquet, pending an invitation. 
        </p><p align="left">
        The fans' were quick to mention that their love of field hockey extends 
        far beyond Ryan Field. Although he has never played the game, Stevens 
        often wears a field hockey skirt around his house. &quot;I really enjoy 
        it when he wears the uniform,&quot; O'Neill said, &quot;you can really 
        see the definition in his legs.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        Stevens and O'Neill believe their unique approach to their jobs adds both 
        an exciting and entertaining element to the games. This is one of the 
        reasons they believe people should come out to watch field hockey games. 
        &quot;We try to spice things up,&quot; Stevens said. &quot;We like to 
        think of ourselves as new-age, new-wave.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        But the fans clearly expressed the main reason to go to field hockey games. 
        O'Neill said, &quot;The Bowdoin field hockey team really kicks ass. It's 
        just a wonderful thing to be out there watching the game.&quot; So if 
        you want to see the fans-of-the-week and the talented field hockey team 
        in action, head out this weekend to watch Bowdoin field hockey who are 
        playing against Bates to clinch the top NESCAC seed entering the playoffs.
