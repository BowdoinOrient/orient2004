        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Emmitt passed Sweetness as the all-time rushing leader, 
        Barry's Giants fell to the Angels in seven, Tom (Watson) won the Senior 
        Tour Championship in soggy conditions, and I am now on a first name basis 
        with pro athletes. All in all, a heck of lot happened in one short week. 
        </p><p align="left">
        The week's biggest story? Emmitt Smith ran 9.5 miles during his 13 year 
        NFL career to top Walter Payton's historic mark of 16,728 career-rushing 
        yards. Although a few of you may claim to have run at least 9.5 miles 
        in the past 13 years, you did not do it against men who weigh upwards 
        of 350 pounds.</p><p align="left">
        On a personal note, when I was 11-years-old, I traded a Joe Montana second-year 
        playing card for an Emmitt Smith rookie card in mint condition. Ten years 
        later, my investment has paid off, as I am suddenly a richer man. Thanks 
        Emmitt-I always believed in you.</p><p align="left">
        During his rookie season, scouts and analysts claimed that Smith was too 
        slow and too small to be an effective running back in the NFL. Thirteen 
        years later, he continues to churn out the yards, stringing together 11 
        straight 1,000-yard seasons. </p><p align="left">
        Add a few Super Bowl trophies, league rushing titles, and 161 career touchdowns, 
        you have the game's greatest back to ever lace up a pair of sneakers-at 
        least according to aggregate statistics. However, as my trusted colleague 
        in Chamberlain 308 told me, &quot;Emmitt was a good back, but he was great 
        at not getting hurt.&quot;</p><p align="left">
        What is most remarkable about Smith is the fact that he never started 
        less than 13 games in each of his 13 NFL seasons. Playing upon turf for 
        his entire career, Emmitt never tore out a knee, developed chronic turf 
        toe, nor experienced repeated concussions-injuries often associated with 
        playing on the fake stuff.</p><p align="left">
        Other RBs, like Gale Sayers and Bo Jackson, were better running backs, 
        but exited the game prematurely due to injury.</p><p align="left">
        In a single game in 1965, Sayers rushed for an NFL record six touchdowns, 
        which translates in 42 points from one man. By the way, he was only a 
        rookie. He also totes an impressive 5.0 yards-per-carry average for his 
        career. Emmitt's career average is 4.3, and he only once topped five yards-per-carry 
        for an entire season.</p><p align="left">
        Bo Jackson, on the other hand, averaged 5.3 yards-per-carry-a full yard 
        more than Smith's-during his short, four year NFL career. Combing speed 
        and grace with a 6'1', 220-pound frame, Bo was simply unstoppable.</p><p align="left">
        So, what's Emmitt's edge? He never faced a career-threatening injury despite 
        playing the game's most dangerous position. The average running back spends 
        just approximately three years in the league before exiting due to physical 
        deterioration or injury. Emmitt Smith has spent 13 as starting running 
        back capable of producing 1000-yard seasons. </p><p align="left">
        Like Cal Ripken Jr, Emmitt Smith is an iron man, and therein resides his 
        greatness.</p><p align="left">
        Next up? Bonds walks through seven-game Series. After compiling eight 
        hits (including four home runs), six RBIs, and eight runs in 17 at-bats, 
        it's hard to criticize Barry Bonds performance in the World Series. However, 
        I'm going to do it anyways.</p><p align="left">
        Bonds walked 13 times against the Angels to set a World Series record. 
        His final at-bat fit him well-five pitches and a free pass to first base, 
        courtesy of rookie pitcher Francisco Rodriguez. </p><p align="left">
        In baseball, the better a player becomes, the less he is allowed to participate. 
        The Angels neutralized Bonds for the most part. Although he hit four deep 
        shots, he only produced six total RBIs. Anaheim's pitching staff simply 
        would not allow Barry to beat them with men on base.</p><p align="left">
        With catcher Benito Santiago hitting behind Bonds, there was no incentive 
        to challenge the game's most dominant offensive player. One mistake could 
        have changed the entire complexion of the World Series.</p><p align="left">
        Due to this game-changing ability, the Angels intentionally walked Bonds 
        in certain situations and pitched cautiously to him in others. His final 
        at-bat was a perfect example of an Angels pitcher cautiously pitching 
        to the slugger.</p><p align="left">
        Rodriquez was unwilling to throw anything over the meat of the plate. 
        Instead, he nibbled around the edges of the strike zone. As a result, 
        Bonds' final World Series at-bat, and possibly the final postseason at-bat 
        of his career, resulted in a walk - not a base hit, not a homer, but also 
        not a strikeout.</p><p align="left">
        Barry, I will give you this advice freely-in the last game of the season, 
        you go down swinging. It's game seven of the World Series and you are 
        still waiting for that perfect pitch-waiting for that pitcher's mistake 
        to turn into a 471-foot bomb.</p><p align="left">
        First base is open. Second base is open. Third base is open. Rodriguez 
        may be young, but he's not stupid. You will not see any pitch up in the 
        zone or across the middle of the plate. Forget about it. You are neutralized 
        unless you take a chance at a pitch outside the zone.</p><p align="left">
        Even if you look ugly doing it, you tried to create something. Do you 
        really want to depend upon Benito Santiago to start an eighth inning rally? 
        Do you think he will get the first hit of the inning against one of the 
        game's best set-up men who is beaming with confidence after striking out 
        two players already?</p><p align="left">
        I am not advocating that Bonds should have struck out while swinging at 
        pitches in the dirt. Rather, Bonds should have taken a chance in the eighth 
        against the Angels when his team was down by three runs. </p><p align="left">
        And finally, Tom Watson wins Senior tournament! You didn't really expect 
        me to talk about the Senior Professional Golf Association, did you?</p>
