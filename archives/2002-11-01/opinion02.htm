        <font size="2">KATHERINE CRANE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Isn't it strange how terrorist attacks always seem to help 
        George W. Bush? September 11 sent his approval ratings sky-high, and even 
        the possibility of terrorism in the distant future was enough to convince 
        Congress to let him start a war in Iraq. And now Bush's old friend Pooty-Poot, 
        who just a few weeks ago was refusing to support him, has rejoined the 
        team.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On Monday, Putin declared his own war on international terrorism. Of course, 
        Putin didn't really mean it, any more than Bush meant it when he talked 
        about being at war with all the countries that harbor terrorists. For 
        one thing, the guerrillas who seized a Moscow theater and took the audience 
        hostage Wednesday night were not international terrorists; they were Chechen 
        rebels with a legitimate grievance. But Putin is clever-quite a bit cleverer 
        than his American counterpart-and he seems to have reached the conclusion 
        that what worked for the United States can work for him.</p>
      <p align="left">
        So far, the threat of terrorism has served a double purpose for Bush. 
        By making a vague and probably fictitious link between Saddam Hussein 
        and al Qaeda, he has somehow wangled himself the power to attack Iraq. 
        By turning the entire nation's attention to Iraq just when the economy 
        was tanking, he has managed to keep his approval rating from going down 
        with it. In other words, Bush has used the specter of international terrorism 
        to pursue his own agenda, and at the same time deflect criticism at home. 
        That is just what Putin is trying to do now, and it looks as if he will 
        succeed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Like Bush, Putin wants to deflect public attention from something; in 
        this case, the mysterious and dangerous gas that Russian commandos pumped 
        into the theater, possibly keeping the building from exploding, but also 
        killing 116 hostages. Putin has refused to answer questions about the 
        type of gas used, and he certainly doesn't want attention focused on the 
        inadequate medical care given to people severely affected by it. If Putin 
        keeps people furious at the foreign terrorists who plotted to kill hundreds 
        of civilians, they won't have time to wonder why Putin chose to risk all 
        those lives when he could have saved them all by ending the war in Chechnya.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Like Bush, Putin wants a war. Or rather, he wants to continue the war 
        that is already going on against Chechnya, and has been for the last three 
        years, though the conflict is much older than that. The original war between 
        Russia and Chechnya began in 1851, when Russia began annexing the Balkan 
        states along its borders, and Chechens have never considered the war to 
        be over. Over the course of the past 150 years the Chechens have been 
        attacked, suppressed, exiled, liberated, taken over and attacked again, 
        and it is not entirely surprising if they have little attachment to Russia.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In fact, there is no conceivable reason, other than national pride, why 
        Russia would not be glad to be rid of Chechnya. National pride can be 
        very strong, though, and when a very large country goes to war against 
        a very small country, which then keeps the war going for 150 years, it 
        is fairly embarrassing for the large country to admit defeat. When Putin 
        chose to perform a high-risk rescue operation rather than listen to the 
        pleas of the hostages and end the war, he made it very clear to the people 
        of Moscow that he would rather see them dead than see himself embarrassed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        That is why it is so important to Putin that foreign terrorists be blamed 
        for the attack. If Putin joins the United States in making a stand against 
        international terrorism, his dangerous act of stubbornness becomes a courageous 
        refusal to give in to the forces of evil. Bush, who needs all the foreign 
        support he can get, certainly won't object.</p>
