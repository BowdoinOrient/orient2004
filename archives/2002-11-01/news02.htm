      <p align="left"><font size="5">Robert Reich speaks on war economics</font><font size="5"><br>
        <font size="2">JONATHAN PEREZ<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> With his speech entitled The War on Terrorism: Economic 
        Consequences former secretary of labor under President Clinton, Robert 
        Reich addressed many of the present day concerns Americans have about 
        a pending war in Iraq.</p><p align="left">
        Reich began his speech by highlighting Americans' two most important concerns 
        according to recent polls: a shaky economy and a possible war overseas. 
        He stated that these issues have been compartmentalized, that is, the 
        relationships between the two issues have not been given much attention 
        and are seen as isolated incidents.</p><p align="left">
        He addressed three particular ways the war against terrorism and the pending 
        war on Iraq have affected the economy of the United States as well as 
        the global economy. </p><p align="left">
        Reich first discussed the public's concern with the budget and the infamous 
        &quot;guns vs. butter&quot; debate, which centered around the effect a 
        military war would have on the homeland budget. Reich drew parallels between 
        the late 60s to early 70s and today, noting that then inflation skyrocketed 
        around the time of the war in Vietnam. &quot;But that is a different circumstance 
        than if you are dealing with an underutilized economy, like we have now.&quot; 
        Pointing to the underutilized capacity of factories and industries and 
        their production value combined with a low unemployment rate around 5.8 
        percent, &quot;Mr. Reich stated that under our circumstances, &quot;having 
        a lot of military spending may not take away from the country's capacity 
        to do a lot of other domestic things should we wish to do so.&quot; In 
        other words, deficits are not necessarily bad when there is an underutilized 
        capacity and the risk of inflation is less of a threat.</p><p align="left">
        Secondly, he found the real problem to lie in the post 9/11 increased 
        closing of America's borders on all fronts. &quot;With the movement of 
        goods, the movement of people, the movement even into our ports: it is 
        harder to simply move things into the United States, it is harder for 
        people to get into the United States.&quot; Thus, this presents a threat 
        to our global economic system. Reich went on to state that, at its basic 
        structure, globalization depends on global integration in terms of products, 
        materials, and global investments, which is inhibited when the movement 
        of people and goods across borders is threatened. </p><p align="left">
        &quot;Post 9/11 we find a fundamental shift in our political thinking 
        about immigrants,&quot; he said. In the advent of racial profiling, many 
        civil liberties are violated, inhibiting the flow of immigrants and future 
        workers through our borders. Reich, as an advocate for the liberalization 
        of U.S. borders prior to 9/11, found that those individuals who were driven 
        to become U.S. citizens have the dual capacity of hard work and commitment. 
        </p><p align="left">
        A third problem Mr. Reich addressed concerned the practices of the current 
        administration's militarization of foreign policy and the combined unilateralism 
        on many issues concerned with foreign policy. &quot;But when the current 
        administration says 'No' to almost every international treaty that comes 
        its way-whether we are talking about Kyoto, global warming,&#133;the anti-proliferation 
        of nuclear and chemical weapons, or we are talking about a treaty with 
        regards to international criminal court-whatever the treaty is, this administration 
        has essentially said no.&quot; And in this sense, Reich highlighted a 
        second problem that has occurred in regards to the doctrine of unilateral 
        preemption that the current administration has taken towards global treaties. 
        </p><p align="left">
        In both cases, Mr. Reich pointed to issues that seem to be a detriment 
        to the global economy and globalization in general: first, the closing 
        of borders and, second, the attitude of unilateralism in foreign policy. 
        He predicted long-term effects that might indicate the beginning stages 
        of a direct retreat from globalization. &quot;At a time of international 
        terror this may be the wrong way to go.&quot;</p>
