        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">There's a fantastic exchange midway into Dave Eggers' new 
        book <i>You Shall Know Our Velocity</i>, in which the narrator, Will, 
        details his recent adventures to his mom via trans-Atlantic phone call. 
        Will is in the midst of a seven day, round-the-world, giving spree. With 
        the help of his friend Hand, he is trying to unload $32,000 through independent 
        acts of random charity, and simultaneously come to grips with the recent 
        death of his lifelong friend Jack. In the middle of explaining the impulsive 
        and biased techniques he uses to determine who receives his money along 
        the way, Will's mom interrupts, asking, &quot;Don't you think it's all 
        a little condescending?&quot; Will, after much internal consideration, 
        replies &quot;I just think you're overthinking it, Mom.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        I still have a stain from where the irony dripped off the page and ran 
        down my sleeve. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Will is ostensibly a stand-in for Eggers, employing the same voice that 
        carried his first autobiographical work, A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering 
        Genius. Anyone who read Heartbreaking knows there is one thing you can 
        expect from Dave Eggers, and that is overthinking. An epically ironic, 
        endlessly self-reflective and emotionally sweeping book, Heartbreaking 
        boldly lays out its emotions, then examines the laying out, and then examines 
        the examination. While Velocity never manages to create the same urgency 
        in its emotional core, the plot is uniquely suited to Eggers' other priorities. 
        </p>
      <p align="left"> <i>Velocity</i> might be best described as an updated <i>On 
        The Road</i>-a mad, whirlwind, buddy comedy and travelogue, with Will 
        as the introspective Sal Paradise, and Hand as the impulsive, Dean Moriarty-esque 
        contrast. This time the boys are going global. But don't worry, Eggers 
        employs a Kerouacian vigor in ignoring the distinct character of the places 
        they visit, yielding instead to Will's internal self-preoccupation. Eggers 
        also prevents Will's excess of funds from compromising the passivity of 
        their journey. They don't hitchhike, but they do refuse to create an itinerary, 
        insisting instead on going wherever the next flight that doesn't require 
        international visas will take them. </p>
      <p align="left"> But where On The Road is notorious for the haphazard speed 
        with which Kerouac pounded it out, everything about <i>Velocity</i> is 
        constructed to feel intentional-Eggers wants you to know that he's thought 
        about the implications of his story. Every implication. He makes sure 
        that Will touches on nearly every problematic aspect of traveling around 
        the world handing out money, from the power implicit in acts of charity 
        to the complicated factors that inform the worthiness of need, and from 
        the benign racism he and his friend display to the assumption that those 
        they randomly select even need or want their money. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The distinctive physical characteristics of the book are designed to illustrate 
        that Eggers gave as much thought to its appearance as he has Will give 
        to himself. The absence of a title page, and the decision to begin the 
        book's narrative on the outside of the front cover, are intended to encourage 
        investigation into the book's physical makeup. After several hundred pages 
        of trying to decipher the purpose of each exaggerated break in the text 
        and sparingly-used graphic, eventually even a nonsensical typo will feel 
        loaded. </p>
      <p align="left"> So it's hard not to take it a step further, and examine 
        the peculiar circumstances surrounding the book's release with the same 
        obsessive attention. Eggers chose to self-publish <i>Velocity</i> through 
        his own McSweeney's Books, and make the limited first printing of Velocity 
        available in only 100 independent bookstores across the country, including 
        Brunswick's own Gulf of Maine Books. But this act of defiance to the publishing 
        establishment, and selfless support of struggling independent bookstores 
        actually bears a striking resemblance to Will and Hand's loaded undertaking. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The McSweeney's 100&quot;, those stores that won the honor of carrying 
        Eggers' new book, did so only after agreeing to carry every other book 
        McSweeney's publishes. Though limiting the carriers of his book certainly 
        ensures that only these independent book stores will profit off its sales, 
        it also restricts access to the book, simultaneously forcing more people 
        to order directly from the McSweeney's website (therefore cutting out 
        the middleman altogether) and implying that only those readers in areas 
        that can support one of these independent bookstores (or who prove their 
        loyalty to Eggers by making the trek to a distant one) are worthy of Velocity. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even if you ignore the blatant manipulation at work here, and focus on 
        the act of charity towards independent bookstores, you can't deny that 
        the assumption that selling a couple copies of Eggers' book will have 
        any real affect on independent bookstores' survival is just a touch condescending. 
        But then again, maybe that's just overthinking it. </p>
