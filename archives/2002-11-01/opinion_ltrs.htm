      <p align="left"><font size="5">Grading system: time to move on</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Given the recent surge of commentary about last semester's plus/minus 
        controversy, I wonder why certain students feel compelled to dig up a 
        dead horse only to beat it up some more. The fact is that it is a non-issue, 
        and the students of Bowdoin need-and deserve-to put it behind them. </p>
      <p>
        Last week, all three letters to the editor addressed the plus/minus debate. 
        One letter bravely questioned the recent flare-up of rhetoric on the issue 
        and urged that we finally move on. Unfortunately, the other two letters 
        simply pressed the issue further. I cannot fathom how pluses and minuses 
        will increase competition among students. As a college student, I don't 
        go around comparing grades, hoping to derive some middle school satisfaction 
        that Frank and Louise got Bs in the class in which I got an A. Furthermore, 
        the argument that pluses and minuses warrant an impossible level of accuracy 
        in evaluation does not hold either. Grades measure achievement, not ability. 
        The addition of pluses and minuses, then, can indicate that there is still 
        room for improvement where, under the old system, we would have seemingly 
        achieved our &quot;best&quot; possible work with greater ease. Let us 
        not forget that, as students, we are all called to relentlessly pursue 
        academic excellence, even if that now takes the form of a &quot;+.&quot;</p>
      <p>Two of last week's letters attack the faculty for not &quot;caring&quot; 
        and seemingly ignoring student opinion. I firmly believe that Bowdoin's 
        greatest offer to students is the opportunity to closely interact with 
        enthusiastic, knowledgeable professors who are deeply committed to their 
        success and are not tyrants of the report card. That the faculty ostensibly 
        ignored the &quot;screaming&quot; of an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; 
        (the &quot;overwhelming majority,&quot; in fact, consisted of a mere 548 
        students who officially opposed +/- in a poll) is further proof that the 
        faculty prefers to see students as individuals and not one giant activist 
        group to whose every demand it must bow. To place such unnecessary importance 
        on an issue as insignificant as pluses and minuses in evaluating Bowdoin 
        is to ignore the many attributes that make it a great place. For those 
        who continue to point fingers at the &quot;totalitarian&quot; regime that 
        is the Bowdoin Faculty, you are alienating yourselves from a tremendous 
        asset. And for those who would rather be where there are no pluses or 
        minuses, there's still time to leave. If you do, please take your misguided 
        activism and groundless accusations with you.</p>
      <p>
        Sincerely,</p>
      <p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>NESCAC resolutions misread</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>There appeared in the Orient two weeks ago an article criticizing the 
        NESCAC presidents for their decision to reexamine the role of out-of-season 
        athletic training. The article was inaccurate on a number of levels, but 
        most erroneously when it alleged that the presidents had decided to ban 
        out-of-season activity altogether. As co-chairs of the Student Athletic 
        Advisory Council and captains of our respective sports, we are greatly 
        concerned by this issue. We have spent numerous hours in the past weeks 
        examining the NESCAC policy and reviewing how Bowdoin teams train in the 
        off-season along with other captains, athletes, coaches and the athletic 
        director. It is our opinion that most of what takes place at Bowdoin is 
        not only within the spirit of NESCAC athletics, but is a fun and healthy 
        compliment to our academics and other activities. The few extremes that 
        existed at Bowdoin, such as off-season intercollegiate team competition, 
        have now been eliminated due to this review by the presidents. Optional 
        out-of-season training, as many winter and spring teams are engaged in 
        now, will continue. We hope that this will help assuage the concerns of 
        any members of the Bowdoin community. </p>
      <p>In the future, when issues surrounding athletics and their place at Bowdoin 
        arise, we invite members of the Bowdoin community to seek out the Student 
        Athletic Advisory Council as a forum for meaningful discussion and debate.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Lindsay Steinmetz '03, Captain Women's Lacrosse<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Does the digest discriminate?</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors,</p>
      <p>We are in full agreement with last week's editorial that praised the 
        Bowdoin community for no longer being indifferent to political and social 
        issues. We are proud to be at a school where, regardless of their political 
        affiliation, students, faculty, and staff see the value in expressing 
        opinions and encouraging respectful exchange of ideas. Given the commitment 
        of the Bowdoin community to freedom of speech, it is surprising that the 
        student email digest is needlessly censored. </p>
      <p>
        Last week, the Bowdoin Women's Association sent a message to the digest 
        informing the campus about our table in Smith Union promoting awareness 
        of emergency contraception and reproductive rights. The message included 
        links to various relevant and informative websites. To our great disappointment, 
        the message was not included in the digest. The moderator of the digest, 
        a fellow student, rejected the email due to the fact that it included 
        opinions and political statements. </p>
      <p>
        While the message included some opinions such as &quot;emergency contraception 
        is basic health care,&quot; the intent of the message was to draw attention 
        to the issue and to provide information. Upon doing careful research, 
        we discovered that there is no policy dictating that the digest must be 
        devoid of opinions or political statements. In fact, messages to the digest 
        frequently have such content. Our fundamental concern is that one individual 
        is interpreting and enforcing policy in a way that is limiting students' 
        ability to communicate with their peers. </p>
      <p>
        The digest is an effective way to inform and organize students. We believe 
        that the digest and the policies that govern its use are too important 
        to be under the control of one individual. The moderator of the digest 
        is overusing the power of the position and this should be stopped. </p>
      <p>
        Instead, answering questions such as who can use the digest for what purposes 
        should be the task of a group representing a wide range of viewpoints. 
        The student digest is an important tool, particularly for student activists. 
        </p>
      <p>
        We appeal to all students, faculty, and staff to review and challenge 
        policies that allow one person or a few individuals to limit access to 
        the community and restrict freedom of speech. Censorship of this kind 
        is not in the best interest of promoting an active and involved community.</p>
