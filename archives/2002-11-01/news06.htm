      <p align="left">This past summer, Chemistry Professor and Associate Dean 
        for Academic Affairs Ronald Christensen was rewarded for his 26 years 
        of research endeavors at Bowdoin College. In August, the American Chemical 
        Society (ACS) officially named Christensen the 2003 winner of the ACS 
        Award for Research at an Undergraduate Institution. A recipient of this 
        prominent award and a $5,000 grant, Christensen has received the recognition 
        for his devotion to science-related research. </p>

      <p align="left">Arriving to Bowdoin in 1976, Professor Christensen planned 
        to &quot;establish research programs that would involve undergraduates 
        and contribute both to their learning and careers.&quot; During his time 
        at the College, Christensen has supervised roughly 60 students who have 
        pursued honors with the Chemistry department. Christensen dedicated both 
        his academic years and summers to his involvement with undergraduate research.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The ACS award also acknowledges Professor Christensen's personal investigations 
        in chemistry. A physical chemist, Christensen studies photochemistry, 
        the molecular phenomenon associated with the conversion of light into 
        useful forms of energy in chemical and biological systems, which means 
        that he can explain the orange shade of carrots or the rare occurrence 
        of blue lobsters. Christensen spent 30 years studying the chemistry of 
        vision; his undergraduate work at Oberlin College sparked his extensive 
        examination of the molecules linked with vision and photosynthesis. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Christensen's commitment to photochemistry and photobiology has taken 
        him all over the world. After engaging in graduate work at Harvard University, 
        he traveled to the University of Leiden in the Netherlands for his post-doctorate. 
        Since then, Christensen has been a research fellow and visiting professor 
        at universities in London, Melbourne, and Okazaki, Japan. He explained 
        that he relished the opportunity to use advanced techniques at institutions 
        renowned at an international level. On his abroad experiences, Christensen 
        said, &quot;Science in itself is an international language. Technology 
        has made it easier to work with people at long distances. It's not that 
        hard to have a serious collaboration with someone on the other side of 
        the ocean.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Faculty research can enrich students' understanding of courses and can 
        introduce them to specific areas of a topic they would like to explore, 
        be it in the form of an English paper or a physical chemistry honors thesis. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although Professor Christensen has worked at countless labs and universities, 
        he still has a fondness for the Bowdoin Chemistry department. At Bowdoin, 
        Christensen said he has had &quot;wonderful students interested in doing 
        science during the academic year and in the summers&#133;.My research-active 
        colleagues in the chemistry department are very supportive&#133;Bowdoin 
        provides a good atmosphere for scientific research.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        At the end of this year, Christensen will temporarily leave Bowdoin and 
        embark on a one-year sabbatical. Although part of the year will be dedicated 
        to research at the University of Connecticut, his exact plans remain undetermined.
