            performs in Morrell Lounge. The band was followed by Hannah Pingree 
            during an event entitled &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; encouraging students 
            to vote. (Karsten Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p align="left">With a name that sounds more like a Disney World pavilion 
        than a band, the Old Crow Medicine Show is playing the kind of politically 
        active music you rarely find in the Magic Kingdom. Their foot stomping 
        bluegrass tunes serve as a backdrop for their liberal political message, 
        a message they have been delivering to various venues around the country.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On Sunday night they stopped here at Bowdoin for an evening of Appalachian 
        string music and Memphis blues. The event was hosted by the Bowdoin Women's 
        Association, College Democrats, and V-Day. Along with representatives 
        from Chellie Pingree's campaign, those organizing the event hoped to &quot;rock 
        the vote.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the event could not claim to be non-partisan, its motivation was 
        to encourage students to vote no matter who they choose to vote for. With 
        elections coming up next week, increasing voter turn-out has been an important 
        issue for faculty, students, and student organizations. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;With all that's going on in the world right now it's important for 
        people who care about change to get out and vote,&quot; said Barbara Condliffe 
        '04. Representing the Bowdoin Women's Association, Condliffe was one of 
        many students who helped to organize the event on Sunday.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Old Crow Medicine Show's performance at Bowdoin was not the first 
        time that the band has tried to encourage voter turn-out. During Al Gore's 
        campaign for president, The Old Crow Medicine Show performed at a busy 
        intersection in Virginia, supporting Gore by holding signs and spreading 
        a liberal message with their lyrics. The band was hired by Gore's field 
        staff, a team of individuals who specialize in campaigning at the grass 
        roots level. Throughout the country, they hired various bands to perform 
        on the side of the road, at intersections, and along busy commuter routes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Old Crow Medicine Show teamed up with Chellie Pingree earlier this 
        year after Ketch Secor, the band's lead singer, contacted Cecily Pingree, 
        the candidate's daughter. The two had known each other for awhile but 
        it was only after a free concert on the island of Vinal Haven that Pingree 
        knew the band would be perfect for the campaign. &quot;They're very attached 
        to the environment of Maine,&quot; said Cecily Pingree. &quot;They were 
        very exited about traveling the state in support of the campaign.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        So far the Old Crow Medicine Show has performed at the College of the 
        Atlantic, the University of Southern Maine, and Bates, in addition to 
        Morrell Lounge where they played their toe-tapping tunes on Sunday night. 
        With a team of five musicians playing everything from the harmonica to 
        an instrument called the doghouse bass, the band members are no strangers 
        to traveling. They have performed up and down the East Coast and have 
        opened for Dolly Parton, among others. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On Sunday, the Old Crow Medicine Show opened for Chellie Pingree's daughter 
        Hannah Pingree, who is currently running for Maine Senate. Pingree spoke 
        briefly in front of a crowd of students and Brunswick residents after 
        the band performed. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Aside from watching Pingree and the band, students who attended &quot;Rock 
        the Vote&quot; wandered between tables with information about V-Day, the 
        Vagina Monologues, Chellie Pingree's campaign, and the Bowdoin Women's 
        Association. Come Election Day, that information may come in handy at 
        the voting booth.</p>
