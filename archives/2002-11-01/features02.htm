        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Many people at this school take an avid disinterest in the 
        stock market. They believe that the actions of the stock market have nothing 
        to with their lives. Granted there are many students who have money invested 
        in the stock market in the form of mutual funds, but the majority of people 
        on campus, I would venture to say, feel that the stock market has no direct 
        effect on their lives. Guess again. The markets have a significant effect 
        on every single student that goes to this school and almost every school 
        and its students throughout the country, if not the world.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Almost every institution of higher education relies, some more heavily 
        than others, on an endowment. This is not news to most people, but what 
        may be news to a lot of people is that the endowment goes toward the tuition 
        of each and every student at this college. I don't mean that the money 
        is taken from the endowment and put towards each of our tuitions, but 
        that funds from the endowment help pay down the overall tuition that each 
        and every student must pay. An institutions' ability to offer a lower 
        tuition, particularly private institutions, is closely correlated with 
        the health of the endowment. Colleges and universities with higher endowments 
        per student can offer a lower tuition which in turn can help to attract 
        more and often better students. Tuition at four year private colleges 
        and universities increased an average of 5.8 percent and increased an 
        astonishing 9.6 percent at four year public colleges and universities. 
        The Wall Street Journal has written articles on how this is result of 
        student demand for better living standards and state of the art resources 
        and facilities such as brand new computer labs and dorms. The truth of 
        the matter, though, regarding these types of expenditures made by institutions, 
        is that they are the result of restricted donations, as is the case with 
        our very own Thorne Dining Hall and its &quot;Thorne Birds.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The more probable reason for the increase in tuition is that endowments 
        of colleges and universities are taking a big hit this year as a consequence 
        of the troubles in the financial markets. Colleges and universities' ability 
        to pay down the tuition has most likely been hurt by the performance of 
        the financial markets so far this year. Bowdoin's endowment shrank 6.9 
        percent in the 2000 - 2001 fiscal year, a much less tumultuous year than 
        the past year due to events such as September 11th. This could indicate 
        even worse results for this past year. On the other hand, the college 
        could have taken a more conservative stance over the past year which would 
        have helped to protect the endowment from severe market drops in the 2001 
        - 2002 fiscal year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Another likely source of woes for the endowment is probably alumni giving. 
        Alumni giving, in all probability, is strongly correlated with the performance 
        of the stock market. The decline in the stock market over the past year 
        has most likely translated into a decline in alumni giving as many alumni, 
        I am sure, are not as capable or as comfortable making as generous donations 
        as they were before. Until the economy and more importantly the markets 
        recover, alumni giving will be facing tougher times. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The status of the endowment is one of the most important indicators of 
        the health of an institution of higher education. Therefore it is important 
        that every student to take an interest in the endowment. Increases and 
        decreases in the endowment can affect the ability of the college to sponsor 
        many of the things we love about this college.</p>
