                    (Public Interest Research Group - a non-profit founded by 
                    Nader) after graduation. Speaking as somone who worked for 
                    U.S. PIRG this summer, I wholeheartedly recommend the organization. 
                    They're good people. <br>

                    I swear, this is the last time that I mention the Jung Seminar 
                    in the calendar. The only reason I do so at all, is because 
                    I finally figured out what its deal is: it is essentially 
                    a series of lectures and discussions of psychological issues, 
                    not necessarily Jung himself. So now you know.<br>
