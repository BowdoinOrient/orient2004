      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming Friday, Bowdoin's trustees will be convening 
        at the Blackpoint Inn in Prouts Neck, Maine, located south of Portland, 
        to review and approve a budget prepared by faculty and staff. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 45 trustees, many of them alumni or parents 
        of alumni, meet three times a year to analyze and study how Bowdoin's 
        money is being spent, as well as to make decisions regarding general College 
        policy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the items included in the budget is the tuition 
        and fee increase of five percent. While many students often express exasperation 
        regarding such a hike, it is a standard measure that all colleges take 
        to curb the effects of inflation. The majority of the additional revenue 
        is allocated to salaries that rise by about two percent a year and is 
        also used to prevent depreciation by inflation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, financial aid is rising faster than tuition. 
        According to Kent Chabotar, vice president for finance and administration 
        and treasurer, "For every one dollar received in student fees and tuition, 
        27 cents goes to financial aid." This ratio, however, is rising, partially 
        due to Bowdoin's efforts to attract students from diverse socio-economic 
        backgrounds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of how tuition at Bowdoin stacks up against 
        the competition, the College is "dead center" in a representative group 
        of 18 small liberal arts colleges. Chabotar noted that "between the most 
        expensive college and least expensive in the 18 college group, there is 
        only a $1600 difference in tuition."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue presented in the budget is the adjustments 
        that must be made for skyrocketing heating and utility costs. The College 
        has not been hit too hard by the dramatic increase in the past year because 
        its policy has been to buy one year or two year contracts that locks it 
        in to a reasonable price. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin also affiliates itself with a collaboration 
        of other non-profit organizations, such as hospitals and other educational 
        institutions, to obtain a lower price. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chabotar explained, "It's like 30 customers in a supermarket 
        buying together getting more attention than one customer buying alone." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also commented upon the rising use of power on campus, 
        attributing two of the major factors to student use and lack of energy 
        conservation. The campus has also been expanding, so an increase in volume 
        as well as in price of electricity also contributes to the higher utility 
        fees. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chabotar said that "the College received authorization 
        to hire a 'coordinator for a sustainable Bowdoin' who will help Bowdoin 
        implement better energy conservation and recycling programs."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also to be approved in the budget is permission to hire 
        2.7 more faculty members, which would be a combination of 2 full time 
        faculty members and one part time worker. With this addition, the faculty 
        student ratio would drop below the 10:1 goal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget is prepared by a budget committee consisting 
        of faculty, staff, and students and then written by Chabotar. It is then 
        recommended to the president and sent to the trustees. Once it reaches 
        the trustees, it first goes to the Financial Planning Committee, then 
        to the Executive Committee, and is finally voted on by the entire Board 
        of Trustees. </p>
