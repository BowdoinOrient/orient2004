      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading back to Maine at last-after three weeks in 
        "Paradise"-we drove up to San Francisco on Highway One along the coast, 
        via Big Sur and Cartnel, where Nellie was to live one day, and die, aged 
        93.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last I got to see, and a couple of days later to 
        drive across, the Golden Gate Bridge.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing up Highway One, we saw the famous Redwood 
        trees-actually driving through a Giant Sequoia, its huge trunk hollowed 
        out at the base-and soon after crossing the state line into Oregon, turned 
        inland toward Crater Lake, a little gem, before heading for Seattle. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we stayed with an old Manila friend of Nell's, 
        called Ed Schultz, an apple farmer. Though never having played before, 
        nor since, "old Ed" insisted on me playing a round of golf with him. "Don't 
        worry," he kept saying, "you're doin' fine, kid."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heading due east now for Montana, we crossed the Great 
        Continental Divide, with switchbacks and sheer drops, an awesome yet somewhat 
        scary experience for an inexperienced driver. Glacier Lake, with jagged 
        peaks all round reflected in waters smooth as a mirror, restored my equilibrium.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driving on across North Dakota, we passed through Bismarck, 
        the state capital, named after the Iron Chancellor and founder of the 
        Second Reich, and I, a child of the Third, could not but help noting it 
        with ironic amusement.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After crossing Minnesota-where four years earlier my 
        eldest brother had spent a year at Winona State Teacher's College (and 
        my sister's daughter Linda now lives, married with two all-American kids)-we 
        reached Duluth at the western edge of Lake Superior.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skirting its southern side we came to a small town called 
        Sault St. Marie, with another one called the same on the Canadian side 
        of the border, the other side of the canal linking Lake Superior with 
        Lake Huron.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning due south, we crossed the Straits of Mackinac, 
        spanned by an enormously long bridge, and by-passing Detroit, we picked 
        up the Ohio Turnpike near Toledo at the far end of Lake Erie, in the direction 
        of Cleveland.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic being light now, at the beginning of September, 
        I got carried away and really gunned the Grey Lady (as Nellie, napping 
        beside me, had christened her car, in two-tone grey) till I saw the needle 
        on the speedometer hovering around ninety, and by chance looking up into 
        the rear view mirror, also saw the flashing light of a state trooper's 
        motorcycle on our tail, about to pass and pull us over.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gee, officer," Nellie said in tones as convincing as 
        old Earl's, "I didn't know we were doing ninety. It felt more like sixty!" 
        Amazingly enough, he relented.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But don't let me catch you again, son," he said to 
        me. "You don't want to kill your grandma, do you?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I easily could have, and through no fault of my 
        own. When the car was serviced after we got home, it was discovered the 
        ball bearings on one of the rear wheels were nearly gone. We might both 
        have been killed. So too on yet another occasion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few weeks later, sitting with Nellie on the enclosed 
        porch of her bungalow at Christmas Cove, watching the eerie spectacle 
        of an electrical storm over the ocean-with streaks of lightening forming 
        an interlocking pattern right across the horizon-and happening to get 
        up to go to the kitchen in back for something or other, I heard a crackling 
        sound behind the loft-door. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly opening it, I saw flames shooting up all round 
        the fuse box on the wall just inside the door. Though not panicking, I 
        nevertheless did what I was later told was a foolish thing to have done 
        under the circumstances. Running into the kitchen, I grabbed a bucket, 
        filled it with water, and threw this on the fire. I might very well have 
        been electrocuted, Bill later told me, and his adoptive mother burnt alive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make my stay in America last as long as possible, 
        I had booked passage for my return to Europe on the latest possible date, 
        November 1, to allow me to enroll at Bonn University for the winter semester. 
        I was to go on the France, bound for Le Havre, but first calling at Southampton, 
        where I meant to get off to see my English friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last four weeks were spent with a friend, an instructor 
        in history at Hofstra College in Hempstead, Long Island, helping him translate 
        material on Karl Lueger, the notoriously anti-Semitic mayor of Vienna, 
        where Ed had spent a year on a Fulbright researching the unpleasant subject.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In New York, I unexpectedly saw Simon, working as a 
        commercial artist; Ed told me how to find him through our mutual friend, 
        the professor in Philadelphia. After drinks at the Oak Room Bar of the 
        Plaza Hotel, Simon and I went to the Plaza Cinema to see <i>I am a Camera</i>, 
        the film based on Christopher Isherwood's stories set in late-twenties 
        Berlin, with Julie Harris in the role of Sally Bowles, the American <i>femme 
        fatale</i> brandishing cigarette holders and calling everyone <i>Dahling</i>, 
        as Simon did too.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, <i>Dahling</i>," he said, "must you really go 
        back to Germany?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of October, Nellie came down for a farewell 
        dinner, just the two of us, at the Stork Club. Decked out in jewels and 
        furs, wearing a pair of dark glasses encrusted with fake pearls, enormous 
        dangling earrings, and a huge hat, she looked a million dollars, as they 
        say. I rather less yet, still smart in my new jacket from Bullock's.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll bet the waiter thinks you're a gigolo," she giggled.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over frogs legs washed down with champagne, she told 
        me she'd love to adopt me, but didn't want to take me away from my real 
        mother.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't mind having two, I laughed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my very last evening, Simon, Ed, and Marshall took 
        me to Luechow's, the famous German restaurant on 14th Street. To save 
        me the trouble of going back out to Long Island, Simon suggested that 
        I spend my last night in America, as I had done my first, with him at 
        his Aunt's on Park Avenue, not without ulterior motive I suppose. But 
        nothing happened. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hope to see you again some day," he next day simply 
        said, bidding me farewell at the pier. In my cabin I found a huge bouquet 
        with a "bon voyage" note from Nellie. Slowly, the France moved down river 
        into the Bay. Standing on deck watching the Manhattan skyline recede, 
        all too quickly, suddenly I realized I was in love.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In love with America. </p>
