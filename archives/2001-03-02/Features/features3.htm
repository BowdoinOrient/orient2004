      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear Dr. Jeff: I've been worried about my roommate's 
        eating habits and weight loss. I think he may have an eating disorder. 
        Any advice about how to help him? Z.B.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Z.B.: By just noticing and becoming concerned 
        about your roommate's well being, you've already taken the first important 
        step toward helping him. The best advice suggests that you find some time 
        when you are both feeling pretty calm and have plenty of time to talk 
        in privacy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express your concern about specific changes you've noticed 
        or observations you've made (about him as a person, not about his disordered 
        eating itself). Emphasize how you feel about what's happening to him. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll need to have realistic goals for your conversation. 
        Obviously you won't be able to "just change" his behavior. In fact, you 
        might not even be the person best or most able to try to help him. Hopefully, 
        you will be able to open the door to talking more, to show your support 
        and concern, and to offer to help get help for him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, you should prepare yourself for the possibility 
        that your discussion will make him angry and withdrawn. Remind yourself 
        that you are trying to help and consider finding support and backup for 
        yourself. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts stress that in trying to help someone with an 
        eating disorder, you should remember that it likely represents an attempted 
        solution to cope with different problems. Your roommate may be trying 
        to manage the stresses and anxieties of his life (such as low self-esteem, 
        feelings of helplessness, problems at school, or with his family or relationships) 
        through eating and exercising. These behaviors are intended to be self-protecting, 
        but they end up being self-destructive and potentially very dangerous.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the American Anorexia Bulimia Association, 
        more than 5 million Americans suffer from eating disorders. Recent studies 
        estimate that up to half of female undergraduates consider themselves 
        "extremely worried" about body image, weight management, or out-of-control 
        eating. Some 1,000 people die each year from anorexia nervosa alone. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many resources available to guide us. You 
        can contact W.A.R.R.I.O.R.S., the College Counseling Service, or the Health 
        Center. You can look on the Web for contacts and information at "Go Ask 
        Alice" (<a href="www.goaskalice.columbia.edu">www.goaskalice.columbia.edu</a>) 
        or "Something Fishy" (<a href="www.somethingfishy.org">www.somethingfishy.org</a>) 
        or "About Face" (<a href="www.about-face.org">www.about-face.org</a>).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has recently been renewed discussion about the 
        meaning of "community," and the building of a sense of true community 
        here at Bowdoin. Clearly, we must be willing to reach out and help each 
        other. We might even consider this our obligation, part of a renewed "Community 
        Honor Code." The impact could be life changing, and might literally be 
        lifesaving.<br>
