      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no surprise to any visitor, employee, or student 
        of Bowdoin that this college prides itself upon its history. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly every college publication cites historic buildings, 
        personages, and traditions as powerful symbols of what Bowdoin is. Nearly 
        every visitor to the campus cites a "sense of history and tradition" as 
        integral to their experience of Bowdoin. Nearly every prospective student 
        asks what it is about Bowdoin that makes it "different" from other similar 
        institutions, and nearly every response pertains to our particular history, 
        tradition, and situation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also no surprise that the College values its numerous 
        historic structures. The exteriors of these structures are meticulously 
        preserved as reminders and repositories of the very history we hold so 
        dear. Yet, it does not strike us as odd that we assign no such historic 
        significance to the interior of these buildings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence for this is abundant: Massachusetts Hall, Appleton 
        Hall, Adams Hall, Maine Hall, Winthrop Hall, Memorial Hall, Searles Hall, 
        and Cleaveland Hall. Each of the original interiors of these buildings 
        has fundamentally changed from their original forms. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we credit the architects, craftsmen, and original 
        inhabitants of these buildings with the beauty, originality, and particularity 
        of the exteriors, what makes the interiors inferior? Clearly great time 
        and mental energy were spent creating the harmonic wholeness of the interiors 
        and exteriors of these buildings, yet the interiors are at present considered 
        unimportant. It is as if the College literally puts on an historic façade, 
        masking an ahistoric interior. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that this College should operate 
        as a working museum, but the exclusion of campus interiors from preservation 
        brings our true value of their exteriors into question. Why do we value 
        only the semblance of history in architecture rather than the entire physical 
        manifestation of it? A few possibilities:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1. The College believes that the interior spaces 
        of buildings are where education occurs, and the best possible education 
        occurs in the most modern facilities</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly true of departments where only current 
        equipment is relevant, such as the sciences and the performing arts. This 
        is certainly not true of nearly every other academic department. A room 
        fit for an English discussion in 1901 is just as fit for such a discussion 
        in 2001. Furthermore, this exception does not apply to such spaces as 
        halls, entrances, bathrooms, or closets. The general arrangement, order, 
        and detailing of even scientific laboratories need not be adjusted or 
        updated to conduct good science.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. The College believes that interiors must be replaced 
        occasionally for safety reasons.</i> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although safety precautions are increasingly a necessary 
        part of public interiors, other colleges and universities have been able 
        to preserve interiors while making concessions to such measures. It is 
        also untrue that interiors "wear out" any faster than exteriors if maintained 
        properly. Most historic interiors on campus were designed to last much 
        longer with regular maintenance than they have been permitted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3. The College believes that students want new interiors.</i> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I dare not speak for all my peers, I believe 
        that those historic interiors that have been preserved on campus are among 
        the most loved halls of them all.<br>
        &nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The College believes that students would destroy 
        historic dormitory interiors without precautionary measures for damage.</i> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that a student is most likely to respect 
        a space that respects him. If a room is designed to be damage resistant, 
        it is our natural inclination to test this resistance.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have dispelled the most obvious reasons why 
        we should not preserve historic interiors with as much respect and vigour 
        as we preserve the exterior of such buildings. Although certain facilities 
        will always need updating on campus, so long as the College is a leading 
        academic institution, gutting historic buildings is no way to preserve 
        anything. An exterior is forever compromised when its interior is destroyed. 
        Historic shells are not representative of an institution sympathetic to, 
        or proud of, its past as we pretend to be. </p>
