      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Otis Howard graduated from Bowdoin College in 
        the class of 1850. After that, he attended the military academy at West 
        Point and went off to war. He fought Stonewall Jackson in the thickets 
        of the Wilderness and John Bell Hood in the woods around Atlanta. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1865, Howard was known as a fighter and a "Christian 
        soldier." But all his training and all his skill as a soldier would do 
        little to help him in his toughest battle of all-the fight for the freedmen 
        in the years of Reconstruction. Faced with a hostile president and thousands 
        of angry Southerners, Howard fought a battle that he could not win.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1865, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, 
        and Abandoned Lands was near its end. Congress had authorized it to operate 
        for only one year after the War ended. But it had been a year, and the 
        problems in the South were still there. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedmen were being killed and oppressed by Southerners 
        who would not let the past die. Oliver Howard knew that the only way to 
        insure that the freedmen would be protected after the Bureau shut down 
        was to secure their right to vote, to use the courts of law, and to own 
        their own land. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These plans of Howard's conflicted with those of President 
        Andrew Johnson who wanted to deny rights to the freedmen. Thus, Howard 
        took his plight to Congress and, with the help of a number of Radical 
        Republican senators, drafted Senate 60, or the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, 
        and Senate 61, or the Civil Rights Act. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two bills were similar (one of the only major 
        distinctions was that Senate 60 was aimed at the former Confederate States 
        and Senate 61 was a nationwide bill) in granting powers to the Bureau 
        agents to step in where freedmen's rights were being denied. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bills also made it clear that freedmen had civil 
        rights which all courts were bound to respect. If at any point the freedmen 
        had exhausted their efforts in searching for justice, they were welcome 
        in the Federal courts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senate 60 also gave the freedmen the rights to contract, 
        sue, testify, and start lawsuits. These two bills were polished and sent 
        to Johnson's desk in 1866. As expected, Johnson vetoed both bills.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 1866, Congress failed to override Johnson's 
        veto of Senate 60 but passed Senate 61-the less powerful of the two bills 
        as far as freedmen's rights were concerned. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But later that year, another Freedmen's Bureau's bill 
        was passed over Johnson's veto, extending the life of the agency. While 
        the passage of this latter bill made it certain that the Bureau would 
        be given time to accomplish its tasks, Andrew Johnson was just getting 
        started with his own war against the Bureau. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1866, Johnson sent General J. S. Fullerton 
        and General James B. Steedman on an "inspection" tour of the South. Fullerton 
        had been one of Howard's friends and staff officers during the War and 
        had served as his adjutant general in the early months of the Bureau. 
        However, Fullerton sided with Johnson when it came to Reconstruction matters 
        and betrayed Howard to serve the President. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullerton and Steedman's tasks were simply to report 
        as much bad news about the Bureau as possible. To insure this, Johnson 
        had reporters tag along with the two. Soon, charges of corruption, murder, 
        misconduct, and political persuasion were flowing north in a constant 
        stream. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistant Commissioners were called inefficient and 
        corrupt, giving Johnson a reason to remove them from command and replacing 
        them with people who were sympathetic to his own cause. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard had all charges of corruption and misconduct 
        investigated, but there was only so much he could do. Johnson held all 
        the cards. His plan was for a quick restoration of all lands and for all 
        the states to rejoin the Union as soon as possible, freedmen be damned. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, he urged the southern states to pledge their cooperation 
        with the radical Congress, giving Johnson grounds for removing Union troops 
        from the South and also for ending the life of the Freedmen's Bureau. 
        This having been done, the Southerners could do with the freedmen as they 
        pleased. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were quickly turning sour for the freedmen and 
        for the Bureau. Many good officers were already gone-the result of military 
        downsizing and of Johnson's firings. Accusations that the Bureau was preaching 
        Republican propaganda were also spreading, tarnishing the Bureau's reputation 
        as a non-political organization. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, northern institutions-including a number of churches-that 
        had pledged their help at the beginning of Reconstruction were losing 
        both interest and funding. Lower agents of the Bureau were quickly turning 
        to the Southern viewpoint. Their task had been a tough one with the army 
        around to protect them, and now with military downsizing, stuck in hostile 
        territory and surrounded by very angry Southerners who saw them as invaders, 
        the Bureau agents either sided with the Southerners or resigned. Only 
        those who were truly dedicated to their task remained fighting, and for 
        some, their ideals led to their deaths. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard himself was under investigation, thanks to a 
        dispute at the First Congressional Church in which Howard opposed the 
        sermon of Reverend Doctor Charles Boynton, who preached that African-Americans 
        should join their own churches because God had created a separate destiny 
        for them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discrimination in the House of God was something that 
        Howard would not tolerate. He wrote, "I do not wish to see our church 
        a German church, a French church, an Anglo-Saxon church, nor an African 
        church, but simply a church of Christ, with its doors wide open…" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard tried to get the pastor removed but soon learned 
        that Boynton's son was a powerful newspaperman who took every chance he 
        got to smash Howard's reputation into the ground.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The junior Boynton found an ally in Congress-Fernando 
        Wood, a Democrat who used Howard and the Bureau to launch a number of 
        vicious attacks against the Republican Party. Wood accused Howard of mismanagement 
        of the Bureau and investigated Howard University, the Barry Farm Project 
        (in which Howard had bought land and given it to freedmen in the D.C. 
        area for farming), and other areas of the Bureau's activity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an era where fear of corruption was starting to brew-it 
        would explode with the Grant administration-Howard and his Bureau were 
        easy targets since they were responsible for millions of dollars worth 
        of government money. The investigating committee vindicated Howard, but 
        there was more to come. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau had also been given the task of paying bounties 
        to African-American veterans. This task Howard turned over to General 
        George W. Belloch, who was later proved to be guilty of fraud. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable sum of money was missing from the account 
        books, and by 1874, the issue was coming to a head as Howard's enemies 
        tried to blame him for misusing funds and for corruption in the Bureau. 
        A Court of Inquiry upheld Howard, but later in the decade, more cases 
        of corruption would surface and assail Howard's reputation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, as all of this was going on, the Freedmen's 
        Bureau was slowly disassembled (its doors permanently closed in 1872) 
        by Congress, which was beginning to lose interest in the plight of the 
        freedmen. For the freedmen, land had been denied, and the civil rights 
        they had been promised were nothing but an illusion. Health care, education, 
        work, and other issues were passed on from Congress to the new Southern 
        governments, which began once again to enslave the freedmen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Howard could do nothing. He had tried his hardest 
        to fight for the freedmen, but the nation was not ready for such a radical 
        idea. Having preserved the Union, the nation was now willing to let the 
        freedmen fall back into servitude. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard's reputation had been tarnished, and his life 
        had been a constant fight against allegations of corruption and mismanagement. 
        Howard University still stood, but that was probably the only true success 
        that Howard had in those years of Reconstruction. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the one-armed war hero retreated from Washington 
        politics, abandoning the freedmen he had promised to care for. Howard 
        returned to the army, wondering if there was anything else he could do 
        for his country.<br>
