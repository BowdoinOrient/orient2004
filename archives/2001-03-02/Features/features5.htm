      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday, Bowdoin hosted the annual Kibbe Science 
        Symposium. Entitled "Unraveling Climate Change," it addressed questions 
        through four broad themes: What mechanisms control climate? How much has 
        climate changed in the past? What change might occur in the future and 
        is the climate changing now? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the international concern regarding the addition 
        of greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, these are all timely questions. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference featured four world-renowned speakers. 
        Dr. Richard Alley, from Pennsylvania State University, began the symposium 
        with a lecture on the earth's past climate variability. Dr. Alley kept 
        the early morning audience awake and engaged with tales of his exploits 
        in Greenland. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Alley, the previous ice age ended rather 
        abruptly, or "fast compared to a congressional term." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alley's lecture was followed by a lecture from Wallace 
        Broecker, a geochemist from Columbia University, and Gary Clow, from the 
        U.S. Geological Survey. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Phil Jones, from the University of East Anglia, 
        UK, completed the afternoon with a discussion on how we can compare current 
        measurements to those from previous centuries. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The symposium was primarily supported though the Kibbe 
        Science Lecture Fund. Established by Frank Kibbe of the class of '37, 
        the fund enables Bowdoin to present "topics on the cutting edge of astronomy 
        and geology." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event was also sponsored by the Phi Beta Kappa Visiting 
        Scholar Program, the Arctic Studies Program, and the Coastal Studies Center. 
        Professor Mark Battle of the physics department carried out much of the 
        coordination and organization. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This symposium begins what can be viewed as the "year 
        of climate change" at Bowdoin. Beginning in November, the Arctic Museum 
        will open an exhibit on climate change as seen from the Arctic and will 
        also host a series of lectures on the subject.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students and professors from Bowdoin, Bates, Colby, 
        the University of Maine at Orono, and the Maine Maritime Academy came 
        to this well-attended event. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives from EPA and environmental groups with 
        an interest in climate change were also present. In addition, Frank Kibbe 
        and his wife Lucy made an appearance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A highlight of the symposium was Kibbe stumping the 
        distinguished speakers and most, but not all, of Bowdoin's physics professors 
        with his own question, showing that even 64 years after graduation, he 
        still has a Bowdoin passion for learning. </p>
