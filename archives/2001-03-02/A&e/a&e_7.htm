      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you enjoyed movies like Anaconda and Lake Placid, you 
        will eat up Python." That's what the back of the box said. Instead, I 
        think the back of the box should have said, "If you enjoy movies about 
        giant reptiles that eat people, you'll probably like Python, seeing as 
        it is a movie about a giant snake, which happens to be a reptile, and 
        it eats people." That statement pretty much represents the intelligence 
        level with which this film was made.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While there were a few scenes with some nudity, which is 
        always a good thing, there simply wasn't enough giant snake-eats-people 
        sequences. And for a movie about a giant snake who eats people, well, 
        that's a bit of a let down. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The giant man-eating python was being shipped via airplane 
        from somewhere in Asia to a government owned biological research facility 
        in the U.S., when something went wrong. "Captain, I think there's something 
        moving around back here," a crew member says to the pilot. Hmmm... well 
        you are traveling with a giant snake. He opens the enormous wooden cage 
        and takes a peak inside. He gets eaten. The over-sized python eats everyone 
        on board, rips a hole though the plane's body so his tail can fit out 
        the back, and crashes into some small town. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We flash forward to the inside of a tent, where a naked girl 
        is, umm, having oral sex performed on her by some other naked girl. A 
        fluid transition from the previous scene, I must admit. The naked girl 
        moans her lover's name in a moment of orgasmic rapture, "Oh, Robert," 
        she says blankly. Her companion removes her face from her friend's crotch, 
        complaining that her name is Roberta, not Robert. "I promise I'll get 
        your name right next time," she responds. "I'm gonna go take a leak," 
        Roberta says, exiting the tent in disgust. She gets eaten by the giant 
        python, who was waiting for her outside. The other girl, Lisa, gets eaten 
        too. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the next scene, we meet the film's hero, John Cooper. 
        Cooper rides his mountain bike and gets into fights with the town deputy, 
        who used to date his current girl friend. Cooper and his best friend Tommy 
        ride out to the local swimming hole to meet their girlfriends and go for 
        a swim. They stumble onto a crime scene in the woods where the town deputy 
        and his fellow police officers are stooping over Lisa's remains. They 
        all lean over her skeleton which is covered in blood and gore. "So, what 
        do you think?" one cop says to another. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon we are introduced to Kenny the Closer, the local real 
        estate king who drives a Porsche. "Hey, you scratch my car and I'll hang 
        your balls from my mirror like fuzzy dice!" he shouts at some kid recklessly 
        riding his bike across the street. Kenny shows a house for sale to Jenny 
        McCarthy. While giving the washed up Playboy Bunny a grand tour, he hears 
        something rummaging around in the garage. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He's worried that someone's messing with his car. Quickly, 
        he hurries through the house, grabbing a kitchen knife along the way. 
        He sees an antique samurai sword on the wall, and puts down his knife 
        in favor of the sword. Gee, I've never seen that gag in a movie before.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; With sword in hand, he enters the garage and gets eaten by 
        the giant python. Jenny McCarthy hears his screams of agony, and rushes 
        into the garage to help. The giant snake decapitates her with his tail, 
        dropping her severed head on Kenny's body.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, a government run team of giant snake killers shows 
        up in town. They are advised by a crazy scientist, played by Robert "Freddy 
        Kruger" Englund, who had done research with the snake before. "This is 
        not some garden snake you're going after. We are talking about a perfect 
        killing machine. A 129 foot all terrain vehicle, capable of speeds exceeding 
        50 miles an hour, with skin that can deflect an anti-aircraft round, enhanced 
        night vision, and a voracious appetite for human flesh," Englund says 
        with drama. "In simple layman's terms... a very big snake."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The team of snake-hunters go after the python with machine 
        guns and grenade launchers. They track him down and open fire. When the 
        smoke clears, it turns out that the snake shed its skin and they fell 
        for the decoy. The python comes out of hiding and starts to eat them. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Later, Tommy's girlfriend gets naked and takes a shower. 
        The giant python sneaks into the bathroom and tries to eat her, but she 
        squirts him with shampoo and throws a rubber ducky at him. She runs away 
        in terror, so the snake eats Tommy instead.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Tommy's girlfriend drives away in a pick-up truck, but the 
        python chases after her. She runs into Cooper and his girlfriend, and 
        they race the snake on mountain bikes. Gnarly. They try blowing him up 
        with explosives, but that doesn't work, so they dump acid on him. The 
        snake dies. We flash forward six months to find that Cooper has opened 
        up his own bike shop. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The town deputy has quit his job in order to train to become 
        an FBI agent. "Maybe killing giant acid-spitting snakes pulled some strings 
        with the boys from Quantico," he says. Cooper's girlfriend enters the 
        scene and tells him that she's pregnant. "I'm gonna have a baby!" he shouts 
        with glee. The End. What just happened? This movie was stupid. The parts 
        where people were naked and/or got eaten by a giant snake were okay, but 
        the character development made no sense. <br>
