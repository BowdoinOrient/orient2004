      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The event this campus has been waiting for is now just one 
        day away. Saamelafest 2001 hits Bowdoin's campus Friday, March 2nd. This 
        is the third year in a row that the International Club of Bowdoin has 
        been working hard to put together this fabulous event celebrating the 
        international diversity of our small community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The term Saamelafest comes from combining translations of 
        the English word festival from several languages such as Swahili, Urdu(Pakistani), 
        Japanese, German, Brazilian, Alemanian and Thai. By combining all of these 
        words from different languages together, the term Saamelafest was born. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The goal of the day's activities is to celebrate diversity 
        on campus and to bring students, faculty and staff from different cultural 
        backgrounds together.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; One highlight of the festival is the cultural performances, 
        coffee house style, preformed by members of the international club, other 
        clubs, and other individuals wanting to showcase their talent. There are 
        over twenty different scheduled performances for this portion of the evening.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; These performances will include traditional dances, singing, 
        martial art demonstrations, instrumental performances and international 
        poetry reading. Along with international food and dessert recipes, there 
        will also be the opportunity to sample international cuisine specialties. 
        There will be a section displaying special items from different countries 
        around the world. The Country Display Section will include Chinese Calligraphy, 
        Japanese Origami (Japanese paper folding) demonstrations and other interesting 
        artifacts from different countries. At the end of the evening there will 
        be the chance to get your groove on to a variety of tunes, including Latin, 
        European techno, African, Asian pop, and more from around the world at 
        the International Dance Party! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the year, the International Club is a supportive 
        resource for international students. With the help of other student organizations, 
        and also on their own, the International Club organizes other events during 
        the year, including various trips, discussion dinners every Thursday night, 
        and events with host families. There are about 170 members of the International 
        Club with a wide variety of backgrounds, including Asian, African, European, 
        Australian, Latin American and American. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Non-International students are always welcome to participate 
        in events, and are encouraged to do so. With Saamelafest, the goal is 
        to share their cultures with the Bowdoin community. In addition, members 
        of the Bowdoin Host Family Programs, and students from Bates and Colby 
        have also been invited to partake in the event. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone should definitely go to Saamelafest and support 
        their fellow Bowdoin students, and maybe learn something new at the same 
        time. This is a great opportunity to expand your knowledge and, for just 
        a moment, leave the cold, snowy winter we are experiencing to travel to 
        far off places. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The International Club has worked really hard to pull this 
        event together to celebrate multiculturalism and to share their unique 
        cultural experiences with the rest of the community. The Saamelafest has 
        experienced great success in the last two years, and now it is up to you 
        to show your support so that this year's Saamelafest can have the greatest 
        success yet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The variety of demonstrations, presentations, and other exciting 
        surprises is so extensive, that there is definitely something for everyone. 
        Then, at the end of the night, it is time to hit the dance floor to show 
        off your dancing ability to tunes from around the world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The excitement starts Friday, March 2nd at 7pm on the first 
        floor of Moulton Union, and I hope that everyone goes and checks out the 
        Saamelafest at some point during the evening. The Section of Display's 
        will be up for your viewing pleasure between 7pm and 10pm. The Performances 
        start at 7:30pm and go until 10:30pm, at which point the last event of 
        the day starts: the International Dance Party! So go, be supportive, learn 
        something, and have a blast! The event is supported by Bowdoin College 
        Fund for The Celebration of Diversity and SAFC</p>
