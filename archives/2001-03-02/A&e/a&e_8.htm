      <p>This weekend, the Film Society brings you a quartet of films from one 
        of the funniest filmmakers of all time, Mel Brooks. Best known for his 
        zany, screwball parodies of entire genres, Brooks has also done more non-referential 
        films. This weekend, we bring you two of each. All of them should be extremely 
        funny to anyone who enjoys a good laugh. As always, you can catch these 
        films in Smith Auditorium, in Sills Hall. They are entirely free and open 
        to the public.</p>
      <p><i>The</i> <i>Producers</i> - Friday at 7pm <br>
        <i>The</i> <i>Twelve</i> <i>Chairs</i> - Friday at 9pm <br>
        <i>Young</i> <i>Frankenstein</i> - Saturday at 7pm <br>
        <i>Spaceballs</i> - Saturday at 9pm </p>
      <p>Friday at 7pm - <i>The</i> <i>Producers</i> (1968) <br>
        Written and Directed by: Mel Brooks <br>
        Starring: Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Christopher Hewett, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Kenneth Mars, Lee Meredith A <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Broadway producer and his accountant are looking for a way 
        to make some money. They come up with a scheme to trick old ladies into 
        giving them money for a new musical, only they will pocket most of the 
        funds. How do they avoid getting caught? They tell the old ladies that 
        all their money was lost on the flop show they produced. Now all these 
        two crooks need is a sure-fire failure. Enter "Springtime for Hitler." 
        This film was Brooks' directorial debut and an instant classic. Hard to 
        believe that I've never seen this comic gem, but don't worry, I'll be 
        there Friday night. You should too. It will be a great way to see where 
        the comic genius got his start. <br>
        <b>Rated PG </b></p>
      <p>Friday at 9pm - <i>The</i> <i>Twelve</i> <i>Chairs</i> (1970) <br>
        Written and Directed by: Mel Brooks <br>
        Starring: Mel Brooks, Dom DeLuise, Frank Langella, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Ron Moody, Bridget Brice <br>
        &nbsp; Brooks does a madcap treasure hunt in this, his second directorial 
        effort. An old woman confesses on her deathbed that she has hidden her 
        family's jewels in one of twelve chairs that are no longer in her possession. 
        A crazy search across Russia ensues, with many odd characters competing 
        to find the fortune. This is another early Brooks masterpiece, and probably 
        one of his lesser-known works (would you expect it to be remembered when 
        it was made right after <i>The</i> <i>Producers</i> and immediately before 
        <i>Blazing</i> <i>Saddles</i>?). <br>
        <b>Rated G </b></p>
      <p>Saturday at 9pm - <i>Young</i> <i>Frankenstein</i> (1974) <br>
        Directed by: Mel Brooks <br>
        Starring: Gene Wilder, Peter Boyle, Marty Feldman, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Madeline Kahn, Cloris Leachman, Teri Garr <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After the success of <i>Blazing</i> <i>Saddles</i>, his take 
        on the Western genre, Mel Brooks decided to put his spin on the classic 
        horror film. What resulted is one of the funniest movies of all time. 
        The story involves the grandson of the famous Dr. Frankenstein. He inherits 
        his grandfather's old castle, and discovers his journal explaining the 
        experiments with the Monster. Dr. Frankenstein decides that he can succeed 
        where his ancestor had failed. As you can expect, it doesn't go well. 
        This film is perfectly cast, shot and written. It deserves multiple viewings; 
        you can start by attending this one. <br>
        <b>Rated PG </b></p>
      <p>Saturday at 9pm - <i>Spaceballs</i> (1987) <br>
        Directed by: Mel Brooks <br>
        Starring: Bill Pulman, Rick Moranis, John Candy, Mel Brooks, Daphne Zuniga, 
        Dick Van Patten, Joan Rivers <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; If <i>This is Spinal Tap</i> is the perfect comedy film, 
        <i>Spaceballs</i> is the film that is so near perfect, it's hard to find 
        the single tiny fault that makes it the second funniest movie ever. This 
        movie is absolutely hilarious. Everything about it is so silly and absurd, 
        you can't stop laughing. The plot is almost identical to that of <i>Star 
        Wars</i>, with a few changes for absurdity. What makes the film truly 
        special are the characters. Dark Helmet and Col. Sandurz are perhaps the 
        best villains ever. They make people like Harry Lime get scared. Well, 
        not really, but they are very entertaining to watch. If you have never 
        had the pleasure of seeing this film, do yourself a favor and come see 
        it. You will be glad you did. <br>
        <b>Rated PG </b></p>
