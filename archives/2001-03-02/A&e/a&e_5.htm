      <p><b>Orient</b>: How do you feel about generally being known around campus 
        as Francis from France? <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: You intimidate me with your bold American queries. It is kind 
        of a stupid play on words. This clearly never happened in France, so I 
        wasn't expecting it (and despite the fact that I've been here for four 
        years, I haven't come up with anything smart to say). <i><br>
        </i><b>Orient</b>: Francis, do tell me about your lunchbreak concert? 
        <br>
        <b>Kayali</b>: I am playing a piece by a French composer, Francis Poulenc, 
        and I hope I survive it. People like it; it's a fun piece and two-piano 
        pieces are exciting to play. I am playing it with Prof. James McCalla, 
        who is a great fan of French music. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: Francis, tell me another question which you think would be 
        good… <br>
        <b>Kayali</b>: Maybe now is the time to mention that I have a piece being 
        performed on Sunday…?! <br>
        <b>Orient</b>: Francis, I have heard that this Sunday you have a piece 
        being performed. Could you tell me about that? I have been staying awake 
        nights musing over it. <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: As part of my honors project in music composition, I wrote 
        a piece, a concerto for piano with band accompaniment. We got a really 
        astonishing pianist, Martin Perry who went to Juilliard; he also happens 
        to be a co-owner and a cook at Henry and Marty's, a restaurant on Maine 
        Street. So, the piece has been going well. The reason we got him was that 
        I did not know of anyone within, say, a fifty mile radius who could play 
        this piano part. The piece is really very difficult. But he is doing a 
        really brilliant job with it. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: So, you mentioned the band accompaniment. Could you say a 
        few words about working with the Bowdoin Concert band? <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: They're wonderful to work with. They're a very lively group 
        which is open to playing new pieces. The students were especially cooperative 
        during the initial phases of this project when I was switching parts on 
        them at every rehearsal. The band director, John Morneau was also very 
        helpful, spending many hours with me discussing orchestration and interpretation. 
        There is some real talent in this band [smile, wink, and other assorted 
        expressions of French cheer]. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: Francis, apparently there are some highly amusing lyrics in 
        your composition, something about counts, hounds, perhaps even mama counts? 
        Do explain. <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: This was supposed to stay top secret! I suppose the chamber 
        choir leaked; they do that. Those are the lyrics of a song the choir is 
        currently practicing. No comments about the mama count. See you in April 
        for the song. Must keep up the suspense. Who is your informer? <b><br>
        Orient</b>: Dana Kramer.<br>
        <b>Kayali</b>: Ahhh. I see she has been taking over Marshall's cartoon. 
        <b><br>
        Orient</b>: Do your post-Bowdoin plans involve musical composition, counts, 
        or something particularly pithy or lascivious you can tell me about? <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: I'm planning to go to grad school. As far as I know no counts 
        in my life; at least that's what I'm counting on, err. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: How do you think attending Bowdoin has influenced your development 
        as a composer? <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: Well, basically before Bowdoin I hadn't written any music. 
        Here, I studied composition with Prof. Elliott Schwartz who has helped 
        me a lot. He definitely expands one's musical horizon, exposing us to 
        the broadest variety of completely wild compositions. It's a very freeing 
        experience, in a way, because whatever you write, you feel you have a 
        place on the map, and what becomes really important is whether you have 
        satisfied your own sense of aesthetics. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: So Francis, is it difficult to be French? <b><br>
        Kayali</b>: On the contrary I find it much easier to French than to be 
        American or Turkish. (I also happen to be Turkish). Being French has definitely 
        helped me to get through life. </p>
