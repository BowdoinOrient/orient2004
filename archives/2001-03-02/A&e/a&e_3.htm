      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, I'll be honest, I don't have very much to say. 
        Valentines week is kind of fun to write about, Temptation Island, The 
        Hypothetical Situation….these things all warrant some kind of fun to be 
        poked at them. However, this week, well this week is just Study Abroad 
        Deadline Week, and, uh, I'm sorry, but there isn't anything funny about 
        it. I could joke about how awful I am at turning things in on time. That 
        would be a real riot. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Or, perhaps, I could make fun of the people in the study 
        abroad office. They are kind of mean sometimes. Sort of a 'people with 
        a disproportionate amount of power' type of deal. Woo! My sides ache with 
        laughter. No, I can't go on writing about Study Abroad Deadline Week. 
        It's just too funny. I'm going to have to move on. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So I've tried to turn my attention to other things that could 
        perhaps be humorous. Um, dinner tonight was Chicken Mamou pasta. Mamou? 
        I thought it was funny. OH! Real humor: Elaine flashed us for Mardi Gras. 
        It was great. She only opened up her jacket for us, but it was wild. Never 
        stop flashing, Elaine, never stop flashing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There has been one thing that's been on my mind, and I'm 
        not going to say it isn't extremely random, and I might even say that 
        it is perhaps the worst idea for an article ever. Yeah, I'm not going 
        to say this will be a "good" article. No, I'm not going to say that at 
        all, because dear readers, the topic is 'foot-dragging'. I know. I'm sorry. 
        But here we go.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As a person who drags her feet, I have been making several 
        observations about feet-draggers recently. It's really quite fascinating. 
        For example, when the Foot-Dragger is in no hurry, which is most of the 
        time, they become this mellow "I can't even bother to pick my feet half 
        an inch off the ground" hippie. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However when the Foot-Dragger is in a rush they become this 
        raucous crazy person, needing to get somewhere but tethered to the ground 
        by their own "chiiill Winston" mentality. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The foot dragger rarely runs anywhere, so speedwalking is 
        the only option for getting somewhere in a hurry. However, because they 
        are naturally inclined to never lose contact with the ground this becomes 
        a feat in and of itself (no pun intended). For example, I am 20 minutes 
        late to a meeting with my professor, but I'm too cool to run, so I speedwalk. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to need you to picture this in your mind. You all 
        know the painful scraping sound Feet-Draggers make when they are just 
        sauntering along. Now, imagine, if you possibly can, the ruckus created 
        when we speedwalk. It's hideous and embarrassing. Arms flailing to keep 
        your balance, scraping noises echoing around the quad. A strange breed 
        of person, The Foot Dragger. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to the non-feet-dragger, feet-dragging seems like the 
        most irritating quality imaginable. Certain friends of mine, namely Grog 
        Spielborg, the Notoriously Outspoken, says things like "Hey! Pick up your 
        feet! Listen to you! Just one after the other. Come on." But to you, Grog, 
        I say: imagine having to make a conscious decision about what kind of 
        step to take for every single step taken. Ever. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Can you imagine this? No, you cannot. So, put yourself in 
        my shoes (ha ha, another absolutely hysterical play on words) and learn 
        to just accept feet dragging as a part of my life. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; All right. That's it. I am very, very sorry. I am going to 
        have the best article ever next week. And if not? I am firing my fictional 
        self from the Orient. </p>
