      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This past week, members of the Bowdoin community, including 
        students, deans, professors, coaches and alums attended various events 
        in recognition of Eating Disorders Awareness Week. Kresge Auditorium was 
        filled to near capacity on Monday evening, when Catherine Steiner-Adair 
        '76, Assistant Director of the Harvard Center for Eating Disorders spoke. 
        Later in the week, a student from the class of 2000, in addition to deans, 
        members of the counseling center and Dudley Coe, and coaches, gathered 
        with several WARRIORS members to discuss the prevention and treatment 
        of eating disorders. Throughout the week, WARRIORS hosted a table in Smith 
        Union where students could read literature about eating disorders, take 
        a yellow ribbon, paint a self-portrait, and get infromation about WARRIORS 
        meetings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As Steiner-Adair noted, the prevalence of eating dirosders 
        is increasing at an alarming rate, and researchers have yet to discover 
        a difinitive cure for these disorders. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While such facts are disheartening, it is encouraging to 
        note that due to the tireless efforts and awareness of some Bowdoin students, 
        the prevalence of eating disroders at Bowdoin is finally being seriously 
        addressed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Given the heavy work load and stress at Bowdoin, it is easy 
        to become apathetic, to negelct seemingly idealistic visions of changing 
        the world, or making any substantial social change within the College. 
        However, four years ago, students took it upon themselves to form WARRIORS 
        (Bowdoin's body image and eating disroders awareness group), proving that 
        a bit of idealism can go along way in fostering change on campus. Permenant 
        change, however, takes time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While WARRIORS initially stuggled to gain prominince on campus, 
        the group has developed into a highly effective supportive presence. The 
        very existence of the group has helped to decrease the stigma attached 
        to eating disorders here at Bowdoin. More students are comfortable talking 
        about their struggles with eating disorders, and therefore, the administration 
        has become increasingly aware of the problem. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the founding members of WARRIORS will graduate this 
        spring, and while eating disorders are still a staggering problem at Bowdoin, 
        these students have made a substantial conrib ution to the Bowdoin community.They 
        have provided students, the administration and other community members 
        with the awareness and education to continue to address issues of body 
        image and eating disorders at Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday evening, WARRIORS sponsored a candle-light vigil 
        on the Museum steps to recognize those who have struggled or continue 
        to struggle with eating disorders. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; With the work of Steiner-Adair and current Bowdoin students 
        and community members, it is possible that someday Bowdoin students will 
        light candles in remebernace of a disease that was fought and won in generations 
        past.</p>
