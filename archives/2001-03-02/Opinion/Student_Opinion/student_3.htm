      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; People watching: the favorite past time of all idle people. 
        I'm a people watcher, you're a people watcher. In fact, if we were both 
        in the same room, chances are we'd be watching each other. I suppose we 
        all have a hint of Orwell in us, the Big Brother-always-looking symptom. 
        If not for domination, then for entertainment. People watching is hilarious. 
        Fun and games. Food for the bored mind, smiles for the downtrodden soul. 
        Why do it? It's easy. It's cool. It's interesting. You can do it anywhere. 
        And hell, the people you are watching don't have a clue.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Since people watching has ultimately become the activity 
        of choice amongst the populus, there most likely is a book entitled The 
        Guide to People Watching. If that indeed is the case, I have written here 
        what I presume the introduction would say. And if a such a book doesn't 
        exist, well, I'll just have to be the one to write it. This would be Bowdoin's 
        rendition of the Guide.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Step #1 - find an area suitable for observing. This area 
        should be spacious, accommodate lots of people, and provide a space for 
        you, the watcher, to sit back and observe comfortably. But also note, 
        if such a space is not available, any area that is occupied by someone 
        other than yourself will suffice. If you are at Bowdoin, the following 
        places have been rated as top people-watching sites.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; *Top floor of the pub on a Thursday night. Sources say there 
        are great views here, plus you get to see the nightly performers. Seniors 
        liven up the dance floor, juniors too if they are of age, and sophomores 
        and first years just bump elbows and try and seem cool. Drunk people dancing 
        are always good entertainers. Good times had by all. Plus, bonus for observer: 
        bird's eye view with little chance of being spotted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; *The union by the mailboxes: Quality of observation better 
        if frequented just after class has been let out. Get to see stressed out 
        faces, and circles of friends hanging out. Can readily see who is hanging 
        out with who. Only downside, you are likely to be in a rush too and can't 
        readily sit back and chill.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; *If you are lucky enough to still be a First Year, the view 
        from your room: You get to spy, with complete anonymity, everyone who 
        is bustling about the quad. A sure bonus for the people-watcher-at-heart.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; *Any wall at a party: This spot gets high ratings. The viewer 
        is offered a discreet location with plenty of things to observe. From 
        drunken dancers to guys and girls interacting, things are always interesting. 
        Plus, this spot gives you that extra edge everyone is always looking for 
        -the comfort of having a wall at your back. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; *Thorne Dining Hall: This outdoes all other spot on campus 
        by far. Oh, the amount of people watching you can accomplish in one dinner 
        - it's great. The observer has complete discretion, hiding behind what 
        seems an innocent meal, they are free to watch everyone who enters and 
        exits the dining hall, as well as those moving back and forth between 
        seat and serving area. Odds are high that you will see tons of people, 
        and chances are even better that one of these people will be doing something 
        funny. In fact, Thorne is so great for people-watchers, that people don't 
        like to go there simply because they don't want to be watched. Face it: 
        when you stand up to get something, people are looking. You just don't 
        know who, or where, or how many. Survey says: quite a few. Eyes like to 
        wander, especially during dinner.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, the list goes on and on, from bag lunches to the field 
        house to common hour, people watching is always abundant. It's an addiction, 
        one that we all can confess to. People are interesting creatures, even 
        better subjects when they don't realize someone is watching them. The 
        things people do when they feel as though no eyes are resting upon them 
        are amazing. Who wouldn't want to catch a glimpse of someone else's lapse 
        in self-consciousness. But what makes people watching the best is that 
        you can never escape the fact that you too will be observed. So laugh 
        as you might at that person who just checked their look in the window 
        reflection, because tomorrow it will most likely be you.</p>
