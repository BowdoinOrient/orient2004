      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. I feel that I have to write a letter to the editors 
        of the <i>Orient</i> because it has been such a long time since I have 
        read an article so eloquent, so powerful and so articulate that it has 
        made my jaw drop and my heart skip a beat. I experienced just such a sensation 
        of wonder after reading Erik Sprague's column last week, entitled "Reflecting 
        on the George Will visit." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The phrase in the article responsible for piercing the hazy 
        fog of the liberal rhetoric clouding my thoughts and leading me to salvation 
        is the following excerpt: "First is the student who rudely asked Mr. Will 
        to divulge his sources for his polling data. I think Mr. Will has duly 
        earned his impeccable reputation. Furthermore, he does not need to be 
        subjected to the immature, juvenile questioning of a college student who 
        is less than half his age and clearly lacks the experience and the understanding 
        of the political process, which only a lifetime of dedication, such as 
        that which Mr. Will has made, can produce." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I must confess, I am the student who asked Mr. Will just 
        what exactly were the sources of the statistics he seemed so fond of spouting 
        off in his talk. Something about his statement that there is no significant 
        voter gap in the United States struck me as odd, I am not quite sure why. 
        After having read Mr. Sprague's stirring piece, it all made sense. At 
        the time, I took Mr. Will's abrupt and sarcastic reply to my honest question 
        as proof of his ill preparedness for the talk. But now I understand that 
        as a "college student who is less than half his age" I did not even have 
        the right to ask Mr. Will any type of question, much less one that doubted 
        his "impeccable reputation." I only wish that Mr. Sprague, in anticipation 
        of the presence of "immature" and "juvenile" college students like myself, 
        had thought to arrange a system of ID verification, much like that in 
        use at the pub, to determine, on the basis of age, which members of the 
        audience could dare to speak up and doubt the holy word of Mr. George 
        Will. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Really. I debated for a while even writing a response to 
        Mr. Sprague's column of last week, because it struck me as too ridiculous 
        to be deserving of a thoughtful reply. However, I decided that the sentiment 
        expressed in the column, that one's right to question should be determined 
        on the basis of their age and nothing more, is so dangerous that it must 
        not be left unanswered. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sprague is implying that I was out of line in asking 
        Mr. Will to explain in detail the source of the statistics upon which 
        he based his arguments simply because of my age (I am 22) and my standing 
        as a college student. My question now is this: When does Mr. Sprague believe 
        that it becomes okay to question? The right answer is, of course, it is 
        always okay to question. In a civilized society, one must never be afraid 
        of, nor restricted from, questioning what others say and making up one's 
        own mind based on the reply. The instant in which we silence the questioning 
        of one segment of the population, we are risking the freedom of all. No 
        one man or woman is above the questioning of the rest of humanity, simply 
        because of his age, or any other characteristic for that matter. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Also, anyone who has ever taken a basic statistics course 
        understands the ease with which such information can be manipulated and 
        the resulting importance of verifying the source of such data and how 
        it was collected. The fact that Mr. Will could not provide me with a straight 
        answer was quite disappointing, as it left me with no other choice than 
        to dismiss some interesting points he made in his talk, because I cannot 
        accept vague statistics hurled at me as the truth without the opportunity 
        to verify them myself. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I feel that Mr. Will was responsible for setting 
        the tone of his talk to be one of condescension and sarcasm instead of 
        seizing the opportunity to make a largely liberal student body reflect 
        and think about the other point of view. I agree that there was some attitude 
        in some of the questions, however Mr. Will responded in kind and provoked 
        the response he received from the audience. It's difficult to take someone 
        seriously who cannot substantiate the information he uses, and insults 
        those who question his views in even the most polite of ways (although 
        perceived politeness should really not matter, as anything the speaker 
        does not want to hear can be construed as belligerent or rude). It is 
        equally difficult to take seriously an article that attacks an individual 
        in the same way, instead of stopping to reflect on what was really important, 
        that its, the question being asked.<br>
