      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is the season wrap-up article for both men's 
        and women's swimming, a grand finale of sorts, I thought I'd spice it 
        up a little with some drama and special effects. Maybe even a Vince Lombardi 
        quote, if I get real excited. But I think it's not only important but 
        necessary to portray the drama that transpires during a championship swim 
        meet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the meet at which an entire season's training 
        is supposed to pay off. The meet that consists of three consecutive double-session 
        days. The meet where the difference between 1st place and 24th place can 
        be .62 seconds. The meet where the intensity of school rivalries is so 
        high that it takes a few Bowdoin security guards to break up a fight between 
        the Amherst and Middlebury women's teams...over a big pink snake.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I talk about the performance of the Bowdoin men 
        and women swimmers, I want to briefly describe the structure of the NESCAC 
        conference meet. Everyone swims in the morning preliminary session, but 
        only the top 24 swims make it back for the finals in the evening, which 
        is where the points are scored. Places 24 through 17 swim in a bonus consolation 
        finals, places 16 through 9 swim in a consolation finals, and places 8 
        through 1 swim in the championship finals, earning All-NESCAC honors. 
        There are three days of the preliminary and final sessions. The final 
        team standings are scored on the last day of competition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team traveled to Wesleyan University two 
        weekends ago for their NESCAC conference meet. Day One saw many Bowdoin 
        swimmers coming back for the finals at night. In the 200 yard freestyle 
        relay, Bowdoin's Fab Four of Anna Podore '03, Kara Podkaminer '03, Gillian 
        Stevens '04, and Catherine Williams '01 swam in the championship finals, 
        earning Bowdoin All-NESCAC recognition. Bowdoin put three swimmers in 
        the bonus consolations of the 50 yard breastroke: Jenn Scangos '04, Allison 
        Benton '03, and Sarah Hoenig '02. Senior Jenny Mendelson came back in 
        the bonus consolations in the 50 yard butterfly, while first-year secret 
        weapon Kiele Mauricio also competed in the bonus consolations in the 200 
        yard individual medley. Earning individual All-NESCAC recognition in the 
        championship finals of the 50 yard backstroke were Williams and Lauren 
        McNally '03, while teammate Melissa Tansey '02 also competed in the bonus 
        consolations. Bowdoin power sprinters Podkaminer, Podore, and Stevens 
        all swam in the bonus consolation heat of the 50 yard freestyle. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diver, Megan Lim '03, placed 13th in the first round 
        of the 1 meter springboard competition, with 281.20 points, and Maureen 
        Singer '01 earned all-NESCAC recognition in second place with 361.30 points. 
        Wrapping up the evening with the 400 yard medley relay in consolation 
        finals as Williams, Benton, Mauricio, and Podkaminer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same relay team opened up Saturday evening's finals 
        in the heat of the consolation finals of the 200 medley relay. Mauricio 
        immediately followed the relay with an individual swim in the bonus consolations 
        of the 100 yard butterfly, and Podkaminer swam in the bonus heat of the 
        200 yard freestyle. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scangos and Benton returned to the breastroke in the 
        100 yards, both in the bonus consolations. In the 100 yard backstroke, 
        McNally swam in bonus consolations, followed by Williams in consolation 
        finals. Finishing up the evening in the championship heat of the 800 yard 
        freestyle relay were Mauricio, Podkaminer, McNally, and Allie Hinman '03.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between morning and evening sessions of Sunday, the 
        distance swimmers got their chance to shine in the 1650 yard freestyle, 
        more affectionately referred to by swimmers as "the mile". Competing for 
        Bowdoin were Erin Veenker '01, Annie Blair '03, Meredith Hoar '03, and 
        Jenn Laraia '03. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Bowdoin did not score in the top-24 point range, 
        Team Distance nonetheless showed vast margins of improvement and a dedication 
        to the hours of pace work done during practice.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final session of the meet opened with the 200 yard 
        backstroke, with McNally in the consolation finals and Catherine Williams 
        earning her second individual All-NESCAC performance with a National 'B' 
        qualifying time in the championship finals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Podkaminer competed in the consolation finals of the 
        100 yard freestyle, and Allison Benton swam in the consolation finals 
        of the 200 yard breastroke. The final race for the women's team was the 
        400 yard freestyle relay, with sprinters Mauricio, Podkaminer, Podore 
        and Mendelson swimming in the consolation finals. Maureen Singer placed 
        third in the 3-meter diving, earning another all-NESCAC title. Singer 
        was also recognized for her four years of diving at the All-American level.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's NESCAC championship meet began last Friday 
        at the Bowdoin pool. opening the meet with an all-NESCAC finish in the 
        championship heat of the 200 yard freestyle relay were Elliot Dickson 
        '02, Michael Long '04, Matt Hammond '02 and Nick Driskill '02. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driskill then earned his first individual all-NESCAC 
        title with a first place finish in the 50 yard breaststroke, also joined 
        in the championship heat by senior Dan Farnbach (who also earned all-NESCAC 
        status). Long added to the breaststroke points in the bonus consolation 
        finals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robie Anson '03 earned all-NESCAC status in the 50 yard 
        butterfly, and teammate Henry Bangert '01 also scored in the bonus consolations. 
        Andy Shaw '02 swam in the consolation finals of the 50 backstroke, while 
        Hammond and Dave Harden '03 swam in the consolation finals of the 200 
        yard individual medley. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long and Dickson teamed up in the consolation finals 
        of the 50 yard freestyle, and diver Brian McGregor took 11th place in 
        the 1-meter competition, with 294.93 points. Rounding out the evening 
        in the championship finals of the 400 medley relay was the all-NESCAC 
        team of Hammond, Driskill, Anson and Dickson.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday evening opened with two Bowdoin teams in the 
        finals of the 200 medley relay-the 'B' team of Harden, Farnbach, Bangert 
        and Dickson competed in the consolation finals, while the 'A' team of 
        Shaw, Driskill, Anson and Long added to the men's growing list of all-NESCAC 
        performances. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anson swam in the consolation finals of the 100 yard 
        butterfly, while Hammond swam in the bonus consolation finals of the 200 
        yard freestyle. Nick Driskill again earned all-NESCAC accolades with a 
        second place finish in the 100 yard breastroke, qualifying for NCAA Division 
        III nationals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw's second individual performance placed him in the 
        consolation finals of the 100 yard backstroke, and 800 freestyle 'A' relay 
        of Shaw, Hammond, Dickson, and Harden swam in the championship finals.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mile race kicked off Sunday's competition, with 
        Matt Byrne '02 and John Clifford '02 both scoring points for Bowdoin. 
        Shaw swam in the consolation finals of the 200 yard backstroke, while 
        Matt Hammond earned his first individual all-NESCAC performance of the 
        meet in the championship finals of the 200 back. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickson competed in the consolation finals of the 100 
        free, while Driskill and Farbach competed in the consolation and bonus 
        finals of the 200 breaststroke, respectively. Anson swam in the bonus 
        consolations of the 200 butterfly, and diver McGregor scored 13th in the 
        3-meter with 282.60 points. The men ended the weekend with two relays 
        in the consolation finals heat of the 400 yard freestyle relay.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few swimmers commented on the conference meet and 
        looked back on the course of the season. "The men's team had the best 
        championship performance we have seen in at least 6 years. We outscored 
        some teams, including Colby, which have traditionally beaten us, and we 
        consistently had more swimmers scoring points than any other year in recent 
        memory" commented Andy Shaw. The men's team saw not only many all-NESCAC 
        swims and personal best times, but some old rivalries were renewed as 
        well.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on his mile race against an arch nemesis 
        from Colby, Matt Byrne adds "...he touched me out twice this year [in 
        the 1000 yard freestyle, in previous meets]. I won when it counts, and 
        revenge has never tasted so sweet."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women's team spokesperson, Kara Podkaminer, adds 
        "it was a good first season with our new coaches and I'm already excited 
        to see what next year will bring. There are some adjustments to make but 
        we've got no where to go but up". Wow. Spicy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for Maureen Singer and Nick Driskill, who will 
        compete at DIII Nationals, therein lies the end of another winter season. 
        I am tempted, but will refrain from using, a Vince Lombardi quote. The 
        swimmers have hung up their suits to dry (or stuffed their Speedos in 
        the back of their underwear drawers), but their thoughts already look 
        ahead to next fall. Great season, guys.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the famed Reggie Noble said, "[Swimming] is like 
        the NBA man, I love this game." </p>
