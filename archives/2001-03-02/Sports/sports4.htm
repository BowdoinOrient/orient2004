      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent article in the <i>New York Times</i> entitled 
        "Basketball's Troubles" discussed the reasons for the sport's dropping 
        attendance and general fan disinterest in recent years. During the 1998-1999 
        season, television viewer ship plummeted 15%. Last season, the trend continued 
        with another 15% slash in ratings.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner David Stern attributed the drop to other 
        competing media outlets as well as a severe image problem in the NBA. 
        For example, Allen Iverson, one of the game's most exciting and explosive 
        players, released a rap CD with anti-gay lyrics and later directed homosexual 
        slurs at a fan who was taunting him. In L.A., Kobe Bryant and Shaquielle 
        O'Neal continue their petulant argument over who deserves more shots, 
        and icons like Karl Malone complain of being voted to All-Star games.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the negative image that some of the players 
        have been projecting upon the league, Stern is also outraged with the 
        owners and general managers of certain NBA teams. For example, at the 
        start of the season, the NBA discovered that the Minnesota Timberwolves 
        and forward Joe Smith had been fraudulently operating outside the salary 
        cap to be more competitive. According to the NY Times, the other problem 
        owner is dot.com billionaire Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks who has 
        been fined a total of $405,000 dollars and suspended for two games.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Stern's situation is not enviable as he must deal 
        with very real dilemmas, Cuban is not one of them. When he bought the 
        Mavs before the season, Larry Miller, owner of the Utah Jazz, referred 
        to the young and energetic owner as a "breath of fresh air" in a league 
        chalk-full of distant owners that the average fan could never relate to. 
        However, Stern has decided to pick Cuban as the poster boy for the ills 
        of basketball. When Cuban is able to escape a week without a fine, it 
        practically makes national headlines. The whole business began in November 
        when he was fined three times for a total of 45 grand, but it did not 
        heat up until January.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fifth day of the new year, the Commish levied 
        a whopping $250,000 dollar fine against Cuban for taunting and criticizing 
        officials during a Mavs game. From behind the bench, the brazen owner 
        stood up and shouted against what he believed was a series of poor calls 
        against his team. While it is easy to paint Cuban as a petulant jerk who 
        wouldn't shut up and control himself, he unabashedly displayed his raw 
        emotions and support for his team during the game. Instead of sipping 
        cocktails and wearing a $2000 suit in a luxury box, Cuban bridged the 
        gap between owners and fans because he is a person with which they can 
        readily emphasize. Stoicism is not his strong point - nor should it be. 
        His wildly energetic nature is what makes him endearing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only six days later, Stern handed the owner another 
        ridiculously punitive fine, this time for $100,000 dollars, because he 
        sat at the end of the bench during a game in Minneapolis. Evidently, the 
        presence of the owner on the bench is prohibited by the NBA, but according 
        to Cuban he was only trying to "watch the game and pay attention to what's 
        going on."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After losing $350,000 in less than a week, Cuban remarked 
        "If it weren't so insulting, it would be comical." Fortunately for Cuban's 
        pocketbook and ego, the first half of the NBA season came to a close and 
        he only was in $395,000 dollar hole. However, it didn't take much time 
        for David Stern to find what he believed sufficient cause to punish Cuban 
        again. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Mavericks refused to drop the chalupa on February 
        15 against the Cavaliers, Cuban found himself on the floor during an end 
        of the game scrap. Mark Cuban guaranteed the fans in attendance coupons 
        for free chalupas from Taco Bell if his Mavs broke the 100 point barrier. 
        With a twenty point lead, 3 minutes left, and 98 points, the Mavericks 
        needed one more basket to ensure that the Reunion Arena faithful would 
        not go home hungry. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps knowing what was at stake, the players tightened 
        up and couldn't hit a bucket until Gary Trent's turn around jumper with 
        3.3 seconds left with the crowd chanting "cha-lu-pa!"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley Person, who asserted that "This is bigger than 
        any chalupa," knocked Trent to the floor where a shoving match ensued. 
        That's when Cuban ran out of the stands and onto the floor. As he got 
        closer to the players and tempers calmed, he backed off and returned to 
        the stands. Cuban's justification? "Guys are pounding my guy's head on 
        the floor, what am I supposed to do?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern didn't see an owner willing to sacrifice himself 
        for his players, but rather saw another incident where Cuban negatively 
        reflected the character of the NBA. He was fined $10,000 and suspended 
        for the next two home games. After he was informed of his recent punishment, 
        he stated that "These are people I care about. When something like that 
        happens your instinct isn't to worry what the rule book is going to say."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important message that Cuban departs at every game, 
        press conference, or mess that he finds himself in is that he genuinely 
        does care. While other owners devote themselves to their team with equal 
        vigor, it is impossible not to love Cuban for wearing his emotions on 
        his sleeve.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For David Stern to censor and silence the most exciting 
        owner in NBA history would not be a blessing for the NBA and cure its 
        image problem. Rather, the league will continue to be a league void of 
        originality and spontaneity. </p>
