      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin women's basketball team has had a stellar 
        week-they've been crowned NESCAC champions and have advanced to the next 
        round of the NCAA Division III tournament. Also, Bowdoin players received 
        some individual awards: Kristi Royer '03, who leads the team in scoring, 
        was named to the First Team All-NESCAC Women's Basketball Team, while 
        Lora Trenkle '04, the freshman star, was named to the Second Team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trenkle was also awarded NESCAC Rookie of the Year. 
        While the team is rich in talent, Bowdoin will be relying on the leadership 
        of these two players. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Friday, Bowdoin defeated Amherst 54-41 to 
        take home the NESCAC title. Trenkle led the Bowdoin offensive, netting 
        15 points, while Royer chipped in a solid 13 points. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie Mayol '02 and Lauren Myers '01 each contributed 
        seven points to aid in the Bowdoin effort. Also making a sizable contribution 
        was Kristina Fugate '04, who chipped in six points. The Lady Polar Bears 
        improved their record to 19-7 with the win. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie Bennett, '01, a senior captain, comments on the 
        win: "Winning the first-ever NESCAC tournament is quite an honor. This 
        team is amazing, both as athletes and as people. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is willing to give her all. I'm psyched that 
        this team has made it to the NCAAs together. We have worked hard for this 
        opportunity." Achieving the NESCAC title obviously generated considerable 
        momentum for the Polar Bears' opening match-up of the NCAA tournament.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Wednesday, Bowdoin traveled to Eastern Connecticut 
        State College to win the first round of the national tournament with a 
        score of 61 to 53. Royer led the team in scoring, adding 22 points to 
        her season's total. Trenkle contributed 14 points, while Mayol and Myers 
        each netted eight points; Mayol also ended the game with six assists. 
        Nicole Fava '03 scored six points and Lindsey Bramwell '04 added three 
        points to help put Bowdoin over the Eastern Connecticut Warriors. With 
        the win the Lady Polar Bears improved their record to 20-7 and have advanced 
        to the regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament. Bowdoin will take on 
        Salem State on Saturday. The winner the Bowdoin vs. Salem State game will 
        advance to the "Sweet Sixteen." After the stellar performances of the 
        past week, Bowdoin is ready to take on even the most formidable of opponents; 
        the team is ready to go all the way. </p>
