      <p align="left"><font size="5">The Patriot Act: A misguided attack on American civil liberties<br></font>
        <font size="2">BEN KREIDER<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Nearly 20 years after 1984, George Orwell's frightening 
        vision of a paranoid world where the government monitors citizens' private 
        lives is becoming all too real. In the wake of patriotic sentiment following 
        September 11, Attorney General John Ashcroft and the rest of the Bush 
        administration are egregiously violating our civil liberties and misleading 
        citizens about their actions.</p>
      <p>On October 26, 2001, barely six weeks after the World Trade Center attacks, 
        Congress overwhelmingly supported a bill known as the USA Patriot Act. 
        Not wanting to be accused of being unpatriotic, our nation's lawmakers 
        hastily and foolishly spent little time debating the measure before voting 
        in favor of it. Only one courageous member of the Senate voted against 
        the act. Democratic Senator Russell Feingold, the lone dissenter, commented 
        that few senators had read the summary of the bill, let alone the fine 
        print.</p>
      <p>The bill was intended to make it easier for federal authorities to monitor 
        the activities of terrorists and eventually bring them to justice. Under 
        the new law, the FBI can monitor email, medical records, and library accounts. 
        Federal authorities may also legally wiretap phone lines, break into homes 
        and offices, and indefinitely detain immigrants, all without a court order. 
      </p>
      <p>One of the most controversial sections of the act is Section 215, which 
        allows federal authorities to search the records of libraries and bookstores. 
        Not only that, but those asked to reveal the records can be prosecuted 
        if they refuse to comply. The American Library Association and librarians 
        nationwide have denounced the act, calling it an extreme violation of 
        privacy.</p>
      <p>While I can understand the government's desire to better pursue and prosecute 
        alleged terrorists, why should they know what books I am reading? Am I 
        a terrorist merely because I have checked out books on topics including 
        socialism, communism, Islam, and Hitler? Furthermore, it remains unclear 
        to me why the government is trying to intimidate librarians by ordering 
        them to keep their mouths shut.</p>
      <p>One of the most troublesome aspects of the Patriot Act is that until 
        recently, information on how and how often the FBI has used the Patriot 
        Act was impossible to obtain. Under a great deal of pressure from groups 
        such as the ACLU, the Justice Department finally released a memo claiming 
        that it has never invoked Section 215. </p>
      <p>In a speech in Memphis, the attorney general lashed out at critics of 
        the act, calling them &quot;hysterics.&quot; He further commented that 
        the charges &quot;are revealed for what they are: castles in the air built 
        on misrepresentation; supported by unfounded fear; held aloft by hysteria.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>It seems to me that Ashcroft is the one who is acting irrationally. First 
        of all, there are doubts about whether his statement is true. Various 
        people have come forward and claimed that the FBI searched their library 
        records. Even if Ashcroft is telling the truth, the fact that Section 
        215 has not been invoked would not justify its existence. </p>
      <p>The fact is that the Patriot Act violates the Fourth Amendment to the 
        Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and requires 
        authorities to obtain search warrants. As ACLU attorney Ann Beeson pointed 
        out in a September 19 article in The Washington Post, &quot;They could 
        use it tomorrow and we would never know, and that makes it extremely dangerous.&quot;</p>
      <p>Those who oppose the act are portrayed as unpatriotic citizens who do 
        not care about the welfare of their country. That could hardly be further 
        from the truth. Dissent is essential in a functional democracy, and it 
        is cowardly to call someone un-American for standing up for his civil 
        liberties. As the cute little button on my backpack says, &quot;Dissent 
        is patriotic.&quot; Makes sense to me. The fact that individuals care 
        enough about the state of their country to publicly protest the curtailing 
        of civil liberties is a sure sign that they love their nation.</p>
      <p>Our country is allegedly the cradle of democracy and the birthplace of 
        freedom, yet our government is threatening to do away with the very civil 
        liberties our nation's founders fought so hard for. It would truly be 
        a shame if the recent wave of patriotic fervor denied U.S. citizens their 
        most basic rights and freedoms. Understandably, national security is important, 
        but it will be fruitless if we can only achieve it at the expense of our 
        fundamental rights.<br>
