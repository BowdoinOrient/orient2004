        <font size="2">ADAM BABER<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">There are 76 Bowdoin students from California. None of them 
        are running for governor.</p>
      <p align="left">The California recall election campaign has been a political 
        roller coaster, with a new court decision or revelation about a candidate 
        popping up at every twist and turn. While political junkies and pollsters 
        have no doubt enjoyed every minute of the ride, California residents-those 
        the recall is designed to benefit-are starting to feel a bit ill from 
        all the ups and downs. Bowdoin students from the Golden State are no exception.</p>
      <p>It's not that some weren't ill to begin with. &quot;Just look at the 
        problems that plague our state,&quot; said Lauren Garry, a senior from 
        Fresno. &quot;The massive deficit, resulting in an increase in taxes, 
        terrible public education, a 100 percent increase on taxes for license 
        fees, and a massive increase in gas prices.&quot;</p>
      <p>Most students who responded to an Orient survey reported that they will 
        vote in the recall election, though they seem to be of two minds when 
        it comes to the merits of the recall itself.</p>
      <p>&quot;I will be voting in the recall because I feel it is my civic duty 
        to put into office a governor who will help California get out of it's 
        horrendous fiscal crisis,&quot; said David Friedlander '06. </p>
      <p>Graham Patterson '06 is against the whole notion of the recall. &quot;The 
        recall election undermines the way our government is supposed to work,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;I believe that once a person wins an election they should 
        then serve out their full term.&quot; Davis was reelected to a four-year 
        term in 2002. </p>
      <p>Others are only voting in the recall after several assurances that the 
        election will be fair. &quot;Voting is a privilege Americans has fought 
        and died for and when electing an official to serve the people, the person 
        should have the respect from those who elected him to serve out his term,&quot; 
        said Alexis Bawden '04. &quot;However, I have already voted by absentee 
        ballot. Since it was approved by the California electorate and survived 
        federal appeals court appeals finding it nondiscriminatory, I feel this 
        is a good time to remove an ineffective governor.&quot; </p>
      <p>Pat Soong '04 draws a distinction between the recall itself and the candidates 
        running. &quot;I'm voting in the recall because Governor Davis and California 
        have huge issues that need to be sorted out,&quot; he said, but quickly 
        added: &quot;Of course, the recall is laughable in the sense that anyone 
        can run for it.&quot; </p>
      <p>Sure, if by anyone he means Arnold Schwarzenegger. Students here from 
        California have a variety of views on Arnold.</p>
      <p>&quot;Arnold is a legitimate gubernatorial candidate and is involved 
        and concerned with the state's politics. His inexperience as a professional 
        politician is one of his most appealing aspects,&quot; Bawden said.</p>
      <p>Garry agrees, pointing to Schwarzenegger's pro-business approach, which 
        many feel is what the stagnant California economy requires. &quot;Arnold 
        is a legitimate candidate,&quot; she said. &quot;He wants to amend the 
        bad business atmosphere so businesses won't leave California and he wants 
        to balance the budget and give more money to education.&quot;</p>
      <p>Others aren't convinced. Sophomore Kari Barber said, &quot;Arnold is 
        a joke. He can't even pronounce 'California' correctly.&quot;</p>
      <p>Braden Anderson-Gram '04 places responsibility for Arnold's popularity 
        on the voters. &quot;I feel [candidates like Arnold] are legitimate as 
        are so many other politicians in this country who lead public lives that 
        are obviously not their own,&quot; he said. &quot;It is the voters' fault 
        for not being able to see through this ambiguity and getting us to this 
        point, where celebrities actually have a chance at winning the governor's 
        race in the largest state in the country.&quot;</p>
      <p>Government Professor Chris Potholm sees the popularity of Arnold's candidacy 
        as the result of Gray Davis' ineffective governance: &quot;I don't understand 
        all this cynicism [about such celebrity candidates as Arnold]. Davis has 
        made such a hash of the situation and is such a true lightweight that 
        any number of people think they can beat him.&quot;</p>
      <p>Professor Marc Hetherington, also of the government department, also 
        thinks students should take the candidates seriously. &quot;Like it or 
        not, the election is going to decide who is governor, no matter how goofy 
        the candidates might be,&quot; he said. &quot;Students are taking the 
        event seriously suggests their sophistication.&quot;</p>
      <p>The criticism of Arnold's candidacy and that of other celebrities is 
        part of a larger criticism of California's whacky and unpredictable politics. 
        Many students from the state feel the criticism is justified. </p>
      <p>&quot;California is a political carnival right now,&quot; said first-year 
        Steven Carlson. &quot;It merits all of the jokes and criticism.&quot;</p>
      <p>Chan defends his home state's political process, however, preferring 
        to see the recall as a bold initiative by a state determined to solve 
        its problems. &quot;I recognize that we have a lot of problems in California 
        and I am not ashamed to admit that. The only way change can be made is 
        through strong will power and faith in one's own political and social 
        beliefs. My belief is strongly behind this recall process,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>The question on everyone's mind is how many voters share that same passion 
        enough to make them show up on the polls on Tuesday. <br>
