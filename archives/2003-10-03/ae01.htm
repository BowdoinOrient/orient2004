      Renowned poet-activist Adrienne Rich spoke last Thursday in Pickard Theater 
      as part of the Kenneth V. Santagata Memorial Lecture in the Arts. Rich read 
      from a body of work that not only spanned her 50-year career, but as English 
      professor Marilyn Reizbaum describes, &quot;unquestionably transformed the 
      landscape not only of poetry in the last 40 years, but our imagination of 
      it-what poetry can and should do.&quot;
<p>Before beginning her reading, Rich acknowledged the recent death of Palestinian-American 
        writer Edward Said, who &quot;for many years was a lone voice in America 
        on the 'question of Palestine' and on the effects of Zionism.&quot; She 
        continued by describing him as &quot;vilified by the American establishment,&quot; 
        a loss to the world &quot;who will be deeply mourned.&quot;</p>
      <p>Her reading began with an excerpt from one of her longer pieces entitled 
        &quot;Eastern Wartime,&quot; a poem about memory and the weight that time 
        can bear on the individual consciousness. Portrayed as an account of suffering, 
        &quot;Eastern Wartime&quot; is able to evoke notions of cross-cultural 
        oppression as recollected through history. Rich read, &quot;I am an immigrant 
        tailor who says a coat is not a piece of cloth only / I sway in the learnings 
        of the master mystics / I have dreamed of Zion / I dreamed of world revolution&#133;&quot;</p>
      <p>Following this, Rich read from her poem, &quot;For A Friend In Travail,&quot; 
        a work that exhibits similar qualities of charged political language, 
        while at the same time displays a retreat from conventional identity. 
        An outspoken advocate for the women's rights movement and self-proclaimed 
        lesbian-feminist, Adrienne Rich writes with the same force and conviction 
        resonant in her beliefs: &quot;'What are you going through?' she said, 
        is the great question. / Philosopher of oppression, theorist / of the 
        victories of force. / We write from the marrow of our bones. What she 
        did not / ask, or tell: how victims save their own lives.&quot;</p>
      <p>She continued her reading with selections from What Kind Of Times Are 
        These?, a group of shorter poems based on the work of German Communist 
        poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) who once wrote, &quot;What 
        kind of times are these, / When a conversation about trees is almost a 
        crime, / Because so many misdeeds are left unspoken?&quot; </p>
      <p>Out of this group came a poem that began on a lighter note titled, &quot;Miracle 
        Ice Cream,&quot; in which Rich describes an ice cream truck as it passes 
        the block she lives on, approaching a nearby elementary school: &quot;Miracle's 
        truck comes down the little avenue, / Scott Joplin ragtime strewn behind 
        it like pearls, / and, yes, you can feel happy / with one piece of your 
        heart.&quot;</p>
      <p>Among her other poems, &quot;A Long Conversation&quot; is a unique collage 
        that threads together quotes from such varied sources as Ch&eacute; Guevara, 
        Richard Nixon, the 18th century Romantic poets Blake and Coleridge, the 
        philosopher of rhetoric Ludwig Wittgenstein, and a number of invented 
        characters, including a policemen in Italy and a female bartender. As 
        she described it, &quot;the poem concerns the centuries-long conversation 
        about human freedom, justice, and power, and the forces that try to silence 
        it.&quot;</p>
      <p>Concerning the question of identity, and the vastness of her poetic subject-personas, 
        she commented, &quot;none of us are a single person-what interests me 
        is writing from a multitude of voices. I hope to develop a poetry in which 
        the pronouns are not necessarily fixed, where 'I' and 'you' are varied 
        and not the same 'I' and 'you' we are used to.&quot;</p>
      <p>She finds her own public identity and the labeling of her work not as 
        a stifling and restrictive act, but instead as &quot;pointers that people 
        use to point with.&quot; She continued by saying, &quot;I grew up in a 
        world where there were many gay and lesbian writers, but you didn't know 
        it.&quot; She finds the utility of a public image and labels as a force 
        in and of itself, a way to &quot;help understand the poem's core.&quot;</p>
      <p>Concerning &quot;Diving into the Wreck&quot; and what the idea of &quot;the 
        wreck&quot; might represent, Rich describes the idea not as &quot;a system 
        in code, where I write a nugget in a ball of string that you can pull 
        out and unravel,&quot; but instead as something more open. She offers 
        possible interpretations in &quot;wrecked dreams or aspirations,&quot; 
        a social wreck or &quot;any of an infinite number of meanings that such 
        a wreck might invoke.&quot;</p>
      <p>In describing her own writing process, Rich said, &quot;I don't start 
        with an idea, I start with some music in my head&quot; and that &quot;it 
        is an impulse more than an idea-an impulse without a name yet.&quot;<br>
