        ANTHONY RICH<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"> A very new controversy in race relations has come to light 
        in a small town 50 miles east of San Francisco. A Caucasian freshman girl 
        has set out to establish a Caucasian club at her local public high school. 
      </p>
      <p>The responses are heated and have come from everyone from fellow students 
        to the local chapter of the NAACP. At the heart of the issue is whether 
        or not this club is or is not racist. In order to effectively grapple 
        with this we must first outline the facts. </p>
      <p>Lisa McClelland, the club's potential founder, asserts that she is not 
        racist. Her contention is that the club would bridge the gap between the 
        races by serving as a catalyst for dialogue between the other established 
        ethnic clubs i.e. the Latino, African American, and Asian culture clubs 
        that are already established. McClelland also says that her club will 
        be inclusive to other races.</p>
      <p>Sounds good to me so far, but it is still not that simple especially 
        at McClelland's particular high school. Over the past few years, there 
        have been several incidences of hate crimes at her school. Swastikas and 
        racist paraphernalia were found in a boys bathroom. Nooses were tied and 
        hung from both the door knob of the office of a black teacher and hanging 
        from a redwood tree on the school's campus. These incidents should serve 
        as a reminder that racism is still very much a part of the reality of 
        American life.</p>
      <p>Many have compared the establishment of the club to pouring salt on the 
        wound that is race relations. The local NAACP likened it to de facto segregation.</p>
      <p>If this club had been proposed by known racists and white supremacists 
        established at a segregated southern high school, this would be an open 
        and shut case of racism. </p>
      <p>I do not believe this case to be nearly that far right on the spectrum 
        of race relations. In fact, I believe that if executed correctly, it could 
        prove to be quite the opposite. Let's be honest here for a second. Statistical 
        diversity does not mean anything without mutually desired social interaction 
        which can be difficult to produce.</p>
      <p>As much as we like to pretend that we are living in a color-blind society 
        we are not. People of every race automatically assign certain characteristics 
        to people based upon the color of their skin, facial features and the 
        form that their hair naturally takes. People of different races do tend 
        to have different life experiences even if their families live on the 
        same block or in the same apartment building. Though you may attend a 
        very racially diverse school or grow up in a racially diverse neighborhood, 
        you may never have a real conversation about a different race, let alone 
        deconstruct the social barriers that keep people apart.</p>
      <p>It is natural for people to gravitate to those that look like them and 
        who have similar life experiences. I don't believe that anyone can or 
        should be faulted for doing what is most natural and comfortable for them. 
        That is why having a &quot;Caucasian&quot; club to promote interaction 
        and understanding among the races and to work with the other ethnic clubs 
        could potentially be a great thing. It would provide a friendly and comfortable 
        way for students of different races to come together.</p>
      <p>At my high school, there was a significant amount of diversity. There 
        were students from many foreign countries and continents: Latin America, 
        north and south Asia, and Europe. There were also students from the wealthiest 
        and poorest sections of their respective hometowns. When issues of diversity 
        were raised on campus, those in attendance were overwhelmingly African 
        American, despite the fact that African Americans comprised about five 
        percent of the students. Here in lies the problem: if race relations are 
        perceived to be a minority issue, no true progress will be made.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Caucasian students didn't attend those meetings because they 
        were uninterested. Perhaps they felt race issues are the responsibility 
        of the minority. Or, perhaps they believed that if they attended that 
        they would be ridiculed and made to be the scapegoat. The reality is that 
        it is probably a bit of all those things. </p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, I do not want this sort of a club to devolve into 
        some sort of segregationist group. I doubt that many people would come 
        out openly and request that sort of a group. Having a club for the Caucasian 
        students would probably facilitate more freedom of racial interaction 
        and the sort of open dialogue that is needed to foster a more integrated 
        racial community. <br>
