      <p align="left"> Boston is a great college town, but so is Brunswick, Maine. 
        My roommate and I visited some old high school friends who attend school 
        in Boston, and after spending the weekend in the city and learning how 
        different their lifestyle is, I came back with a newfound appreciation 
        for college life in a small town in Maine. We may not have a GAP on every 
        corner, or a local transportation system, but going to Bowdoin allows 
        us to be members of a community which, in my opinion, may just be better 
        than shopping options. </p>
      <p>I always wondered if I was making the right choice: choosing a small 
        school in a small town, instead of an urban campus in a bustling metropolis. 
        They are two very different lifestyles, and this weekend I was able to 
        see for the first time what I was &quot;missing,&quot; having chosen the 
        path I did.</p>
      <p>My friend and I cruised into downtown Boston around midnight Friday night. 
        The streets were filled with college students, who were club-hopping, 
        buying greasy pizza, hanging out, or just wandering aimlessly. It was 
        exciting and interesting to see so many young people meeting other young 
        people, going out exploring with the city at the tip of their fingertips. 
      </p>
      <p>On Saturday, we caught the T into Harvard Square and shopped at the Prudential 
        Center. Cambridge was bustling, with shoppers and out-to-lunchers and 
        of course, more students. The Prudential Center was spectacular, with 
        its skyscraper of offices and level upon level of boutiques. Even catching 
        the T and seeing all the different people and parts of Boston. </p>
      <p>The weekend adventure was indeed extraordinary, in addition to seeing 
        good friends, we spent the weekend in the big city! But I am sure that 
        this weekend adventure was so extraordinary because it was just that: 
        a weekend adventure. It was a thrill to be away from the day to day routine 
        life of Brunswick, but then again, it was nice to return to Bowdoin. Waking 
        up to the sounds of the interstate and traffic of Massachusetts Avenue 
        couldn't compare to the laughter of the children on the playground outside 
        my window every morning. The prospect of walking across the Charles River 
        every morning-rain, sleet or shine-just to get to campus can't beat out 
        the five minute walk to class we're fortunate to have here. </p>
      <p>Cities are definitely the location of choice for many college students, 
        and I have no doubt schools that urban offer vast opportunities and cultural 
        experiences that are hard to come by in Brunswick. Coming from a small 
        town in Maine myself, I thought I might be missing out on a bigger experience 
        by not venturing into the city. </p>
      <p>However, I can now appreciate the advantages of the small town we're 
        in. And it's not just about avoiding traffic noise or a long walk to class; 
        it is about enjoying where you are and who you're with. When I look around, 
        I see that the experience is indeed about the people, not the place. Living 
        in the city has its advantages, but the thrill of living there is temporary. 
        The friendships fostered here and the sense of community built over four 
        years will remain with you wherever you go. </p>
      <p>I look back on my weekend adventure with fond memories, but I also look 
        fondly upon what this small college has to offer: the chance to build 
        tight knit friendships and the opportunity to be a part of a lasting community.
