        <font size="2">J.P. BOX<br>
        ALUMNI CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left">Like fall's hardest hue to hold, nothing gold stays - and 
        retirement never lasts. How do you like that? I started off my first and 
        last sports article in my post-Bowdoin days with a bad and awkward Robert 
        Frost reference, but I don't care. </p>
      <p>I have a message to deliver, a message so important that I voluntarily 
        stepped forward to be that kid who graduates and keeps writing for the 
        Orient. I know that the Bowdoin faithful need to hear the voice of reason 
        with October playoff hopes hanging thick in the air. For the College's 
        sake, I hope that the Boston Red Sox lose. </p>
      <p>This Red Sox team has a legitimate chance to win the World Series. Their 
        archnemisis, the New York Yankees, have been placed under such intense 
        pressure by owner George Steinbrenner that they will wilt before reaching 
        the Series. Optimism has been replaced by the hardenned stare of Steinbrenner 
        who has single-handedly sucked the joy of the game from his mighty team. 
      </p>
      <p>The Yankees of 2003 were assembled for one purpose: to be the most dominant 
        team in history. Backed by the best starting pitching, one of the best 
        closers in the business, and electric bats, New York was supposed to cruise 
        to its unprecedented 27th championship. </p>
      <p>However, the greatest owner in sports put a stranglehold on his team 
        that shook the confidence of his players while straining his relationship 
        with a top-tier manager in Joe Torre. The Yankees are fighting to please 
        the boss - not to win a championship. </p>
      <p>Steinbrenner's moronic middling leaves the door open for the Red Sox 
        who are primed to tear through American League foes. With memories of 
        Greg Buckner circulating pungently, the Red Sox will meet the Atlanta 
        Braves in the World Series. </p>
      <p>For the wellbeing of Boston and the health of many Bowdoin students, 
        I pray that the Red Sox don't make it that far. Could you imagine the 
        scene? <br>
        There would first be the obligatory mantra of &quot;We won the Series! 
        Let's light fires and turn over cars!&quot; Personally, I do not see the 
        connection between the two. In Boston, however, you would see 80-year-old 
        men alongside 20 year-olds setting fires, flipping cars, and honking their 
        '88 Volvo's horn for all its worth. </p>
      <p>The sleepy, retirement town of Brunswick would require President Bush 
        (always quick to kick someone's ass) to send in the National Guard to 
        restore order. Within a week, Brunswick would be as ugly and scarred as 
        Lewiston. Professors might even start selling drugs to supplement their 
        humble teaching salaries, and the College fall into general disarray. 
      </p>
      <p>After the initial bedlem, over half the student body would drop out. 
        The kids from Boston would stop attending classes, doing homework, and 
        - men and women alike - would stop shaving. Who cares about anything else? 
        The Sox won the Series! </p>
      <p>Those poor souls who dropped out would return to Boston to live a life 
        in the streets. They would soon meet up with their fellow beared and hairy 
        friends who also dropped out of other prestigous colleges throught New 
        England. They would sleep under bridges at night and stay warm just by 
        thinking &quot;mmmmm, Sox won the Series.&quot; </p>
      <p>If the Red Sox win the World Series, we would lose an entire generation 
        of outstanding young Bostonians. Their passion, will, and drive would 
        be ceremonisouly removed. It would take the College years to recuperate 
        from the fatal blow while simulatenously errasing the future accomplishments 
        of an entire generation. </p>
      <p>If I'm Bud Selig and the Sox are within a game of winning the Series, 
        I demand a California-like recall of playoff teams. He owes it to the 
        game. He owes it to the fans. He owes it to Boston to, if need be, pit 
        the Tigers against the Padres for the World Series.<br>
