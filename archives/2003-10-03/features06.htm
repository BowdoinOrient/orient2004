      <p align="left">One day in December of 1857, Professor Alpheus Packard, 
        Sr. invited to dinner a colleague named Paul Ansel Chadbourne, professor 
        of Chemistry and Natural History at Bowdoin. When the adolescent Alpheus 
        Jr. proudly showed off his display cabinet of shells and such, the professor 
        was quite impressed with the both the collection and the boy's enthusiasm. 
        Professor Chadbourne not only gave Alpheus the names of some naturalists 
        with whom to exchange specimens, but also offered to trade some pieces 
        from his own collection. Soon, Alpheus was a student at Bowdoin, devoting 
        much of his spare time to the study of science. He wrote in his diary 
        of Professor Chadbourne: &quot;I like to have an hour's chat with him 
        whenever I can.&quot; In addition to academics, Alpheus enhanced his Bowdoin 
        experience by participating in the Psi Upsilon fraternity, the Peucinean 
        Society, and the Cleaveland Natural History Society. He was a founding 
        member and curator of the latter club, which was named after the recently 
        deceased science professor so revered in the ranks of contemporary Bowdoin 
        men.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Professor Chadbourne worked on a project of his own-securing 
        the permission and the means to take students on the scientific trip to 
        Greenland to which we have already been introduced in previous installments. 
        In a letter to Bowdoin President Leonard Woods dated March 17, 1860, Chadbourne 
        wrote of his intention to sail, &quot;if the ice will allow,&quot; from 
        Maine to Greenland by way of Labrador.</p>
      <p>He continues: &quot;The price for passage will be $125. This includes 
        every thing except bed clothing &amp; towels. Mattresses are furnished 
        by the owner of the ship. The vessel is of 140 tons&#133; and will be 
        fitted up well. I have many applications, but as some are undecided I 
        shall engage the first that offer&#133;. Though three places are now vacant 
        they will probably be very soon filled.&quot;</p>
      <p>Of course the slots would be filled! An adventure such as this does not 
        come but once in a lifetime. At the end of his junior year, Alpheus accepted 
        Professor Chadbourne's invitation to join the expedition. Four years in 
        Brunswick was apparently insufficient for Alpheus: after graduating Phi 
        Beta Kappa with an A.B. from Bowdoin, he earned his M.D., A.M., PhD., 
        and LL.D. all from Bowdoin as well.</p>
      <p>Like many of his classmates, Alpheus fought for the Union during the 
        Civil War. He was an assistant surgeon in the 1st Maine Veteran Volunteers 
        in 1864. Most of his postwar career, however, was in the field of entomology. 
        He held lectureships at Massachusetts Agricultural College, the University 
        of Maine, and Brown University. He was also the Massacusetts State Entomologist 
        from 1871 to 1873, and the President of the International Society of Zoology 
        in 1889. In 1891, Alpheus Spring Packard Jr. was to publish The Labrador 
        Coast about his experiences and his findings from this and another Labrador 
        excursion, but in 1860 he was but an eager student on board the Nautilus 
        headed to northern seas.</p>
      <p>As the Nautilus drew her course northeast from Maine, the voyage was 
        relatively uneventful, but yielded curiosities nonetheless. The writer 
        of the Williams Quarterly article described his first sight of the Clio 
        borealis, and how inadequate were all his descriptions of its &quot;pellucid 
        body tipped with carmine, rising through the water with a movement of 
        its water wings, as though guided by sweet music.&quot; At his first sight 
        of the Labrador coast, he was awestruck by the flora, which he said could 
        not be equaled in its rich colors and contrasts where pure white snows 
        &quot;rest on rugged rocks or black lavas, and then nestling in some little 
        nook a cluster of many richly tinted species, set round with soft mosses 
        and cripmled Lichens.&quot; He pointed out the futility of an attempt 
        to gain a true sense of life on the boat off Labrador through only stories 
        of the fantastic and awesome. &quot;Countless incidents might be written 
        down,&quot; he wrote, &quot;while the real flavor of the whole can no 
        more be expressed with pen and ink, than we can describe an iceberg to 
        those who have never seen one or paint by words the rainbow-colored Medusoe 
        that floated in the waters, or the rich tinted flowers that dotted the 
        Lichens at the base of those ice-crowned hills.&quot;<br>
