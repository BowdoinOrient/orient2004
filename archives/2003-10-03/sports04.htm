      Enthusiasm, dedication, compassion, and a contagious sense of humor only 
      begin to describe the complex and beautiful person on both the cross country 
      and track teams affectionately know as &quot;Lynne-o.&quot;
<p>Lynne Davies, senior co-captain of the cross country, indoor and outdoor 
        track teams, biology and art history double-major, repeat winner of the 
        team's &quot;Most Jacked&quot; competition, and hopeful environmental 
        lawyer, does it all. &quot;I just can't believe that she can stay so enthusiastic 
        about all of her activities when her to-do list is miles long,&quot; says 
        teammate and roommate Ellen Beth '05. </p>
      <p>Beth said of Davies, she &quot;has this crazy biology honors project, 
        she's a teaching assistant in art history, she's studying for the LSAT's, 
        she has more team captain duties than anyone else I can think of - and 
        when she comes home at night she still has the energy to joke around.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Lynne is a very outgoing person who you immediately like because 
        of her sense of humor,&quot; said fellow roommate and teammate Katie Landry 
        '05. &quot;Lynne is very friendly and has an optimistic attitude toward 
        anything. She has a deep dedication to the cross country and track teams 
        and is incredibly motivated in just about everything she does.&quot;</p>
      <p>Aaron Goldstein '05, a member of the Men's Cross Country Team, &quot;thinks 
        Lynne's sense of humor stands out above everything. Lynne attempts at 
        making even the worst situations into a comical event. That is how she 
        deals with the rigor of academics and athletics.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Lynne is evidence of pure hard work,&quot; said Goldstein. &quot;She 
        started cross country sophomore year after years of soccer, which requires 
        a completely different training plan. After much adversity, she has made 
        the top seven. Lynne just wanted it!&quot;</p>
      <p>After playing soccer the fall of her freshman year, Davies did not feel 
        satisfied with her ensuing track seasons. &quot;I was not improving my 
        times enough in the 800 and 600, and I wanted to beat my high school times,&quot; 
        said Davies. &quot;I thought that switching to cross country would help 
        me to attain my goals.&quot;</p>
      <p>Davies began running competitively in middle school. Her father was a 
        nationally-ranked collegiate hammer thrower, and &quot;running has always 
        been a family activity.&quot; However, Davies has continued to run through 
        college because she &quot;love[s] the girls on the team, and likes to 
        feel in shape and be competitive.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The team is so lucky to have Lynne's presence,&quot; said Landry. 
        &quot;She is a great leader who always has the team's best interest at 
        heart. When a workout needs to get done Lynne is all business, but she 
        can definitely pump up the team and get us psyched for our races or just 
        make us laugh on regular distance days. She's a great role model for the 
        first-years and even the sophomores, juniors, and her fellow seniors.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>As a captain, Davies strives to be a role model for her teammates. &quot;I 
        want the other girls on the team to feel how much love I have for the 
        sport, and hopefully that will transfer to them,&quot; she said. &quot;After 
        four years I hope that my teammates say that running at Bowdoin had an 
        influence on their lives, and a good impact.&quot;</p>
      <p>Her teammates feel that she herself is a significant (and very positive) 
        impact on their Bowdoin running experiences. &quot;Lynne is probably the 
        most dedicated person on the team - not only through her training, but 
        also through her commitment to the other girls,&quot; said Beth. &quot;Without 
        her displays of enthusiasm I don't think we would do as much together 
        as a team. She's like a really stable net that keeps us together.&quot;</p>
      <p>Perhaps Davies plays such an integral role on the team because she looks 
        for the same characteristics from her teammates that they admire in her. 
        Lynne expects &quot;enthusiasm, commitment, optimism, and discipline, 
        but not over-discipline&quot; from her fellow athletes.</p>
      <p>Ascribing her own success to &quot;a perfect balance between academics 
        and athletics,&quot; Davies sees the tendency toward excessive discipline 
        as detrimental to both the individual and the team. &quot;Running should 
        be a healthy aspect of your life, and there should not be so much pressure 
        that it becomes a stressful activity,&quot; she says.</p>
      <p>Many members of the team praise Davies for her attitude. Goldstein said 
        that is because &quot;she maintains a very healthy lifestyle by always 
        getting enough sleep and eating properly. Both men and women on the team 
        could benefit by following Lynne around for a day.&quot; However, Davies's 
        personality is of equal importance on the team. &quot;She also addresses 
        problems within the team and looks out for everyone,&quot; Goldstein said. 
        &quot;Lynne has this innate ability to identify problems before they become 
        severe. That is what makes her an integral part of the team.&quot;</p>
      <p>Davies may well be considered the geist of the cross country and track 
        teams. A dominant force on the teams, Lynne inspires and motivates her 
        fellow runners through her loyalty to both the sport and her teammates.</p>
      <p>&quot;I can tell her anything and I just know she'll understand me,&quot; 
        said Goldstein. &quot;I never feel like I have to worry about offending 
        her.&quot; Beth agree and adds &quot;she's got your back anytime something's 
        bringing you down - she has a great sympathetic ear.&quot;</p>
      <p>Davies is the rare athlete who comes to practice with the equal priorities 
        of helping herself and her teammates. As much as Lynne says that she runs 
        for &quot;the physical challenge and the triumph after a hard workout,&quot; 
        she emphasizes that &quot;the most important part is running with the 
        team.&quot; On the rare day that Lynne cannot practice with the team, 
        her tireless energy and passion for everything from seven-minute abs to 
        heartfelt talks leave a distressing void.</p>
      <p>&quot;I have truly never met anyone like her before,&quot; said Goldstein. 
        As a teammate and shameless worshipper of Lynne Davies, I know that at 
        least I never will again.<br>
