      <p align="left">Dear Lindsay,</p>
      <p align="left">My parents let me take a car to school this year but gave 
        me strict instructions not to let other people use it. On several occasions 
        I've let my roommate borrow it, since she doesn't have a car. I felt really 
        uncomfortable letting her use it in the first place but was really annoyed 
        when she left it parked in an illegal place and got a ticket. Even though 
        she apologized and said she'd pay for it, she hasn't given me the money 
        yet and still asks to use my car! I never should have let her use it in 
        the first place and don't know how to start telling her she can't anymore.<br>
        - Driven to Despair</p>
      <p>Dear Driven,</p>
      <p>When your parents handed over the keys, they also presented you with 
        one simple rule: don't let other people use the car. Apparently as you 
        drove away, you flung this rule right out the window. So, unless you have 
        severe attention deficit issues and weren't able to tune in long enough 
        to get the message, you have used (in the words of your parents) &quot;bad 
        judgment.&quot; Now would be a good time to hang your head in shame.</p>
      <p>I can imagine all the excuses you've come up with as to why you caved 
        and let your roommate use the car, but I'm guessing that your parents 
        wouldn't go for a single one. There was a reason for your parents' restriction, 
        and chances are that it had to do with their insurance company. Most car 
        insurance companies only cover the specific people who the car is insured 
        under, and I'll bet that Mom didn't think to put down the name of your 
        roommate. This means that the insurance company may not cover damages 
        if your roommate gets in an accident while driving your car-even if the 
        accident is not her fault! </p>
      <p>You probably didn't know that lending your car to your roommate put your 
        parents in such a compromising position. It sounds as if you were just 
        trying to foster good roommate relations by sharing the car. My cousin 
        was thinking along the same line as you and let her best friend, Jenny, 
        borrow her mother's Volvo one sunny afternoon. Now, I'm sure that Jenny 
        didn't mean to run the car into a fire hydrant, but indeed she did. The 
        damage appeared minimal, so Jenny hopped back into Aunt Emily's Volvo 
        and went about her business as if nothing happened. </p>
      <p>The story does not end here. Shortly after her little run-in (pun intended) 
        with the hydrant, smoke started pouring out of the hood of the car. Realizing 
        that this couldn't be a good thing, Jenny pulled the car over and looked 
        for the nearest place to use a phone. Fortunately, the smoke decided to 
        make its appearance while she was in a residential area, so Jenny had 
        her pick of doors to knock on. Out of all the homes surrounding her, Jenny 
        had to pick the non-English speaking one. After gesturing towards the 
        smoking car and then holding her hand up to her ear like a telephone, 
        Jenny finally managed to break down the language barrier separating herself 
        from the little old Chinese woman.</p>
      <p>While on the phone with AAA, Jenny heard the old woman's voice getting 
        incrementally louder and more frantic. It wasn't until about the eighth 
        exclamation that Jenny understood what she was shouting, &quot;Fiyah! 
        Fiyah! CAR ON FIYAH!&quot; Running to the front door, Jenny looked out 
        upon a very sad scene. Aunt Emily's Volvo was ablaze. Quickly returning 
        to the phone, she dialed a different number than before: that of the fire 
        department. However, by the time the big red trucks arrived on the scene, 
        it was too late. R.I.P Aunt Emily's Volvo.</p>
      <p>And R.I.P. Eve, my dear cousin who let her best friend borrow her mother's 
        car. Don't think for a moment she went unpunished. Actually, what she 
        did was hop on her bike and &quot;run away.&quot; To this day, the rest 
        of the extended family and I are still wondering how far she thought she'd 
        get on her 10-speed. The moral of the story: don't let your friends use 
        your parents' car. Even though it's been over ten years since this little 
        incident, Aunt Emily still holds it over Eve's head. And, I'm sure that 
        the little old Chinese woman still hasn't fully recovered from that day. 
      </p>
      <p>After reading this car story gone wrong, I hope that it is easier for 
        you to come to your senses and realize that you must lay down the law 
        with your roommate. I don't imagine doing this should be too difficult 
        for you, seeing that the way she has chosen to show her appreciation in 
        taken the form of a parking violation. If you don't speak with her now, 
        you're just complicating your life. Either you'll be stuck in the same 
        position you got yourself into in the first place or you'll have to start 
        convincing your roommate that Razor scooters are back, and this time all 
        the college kids are using them. Good luck with that one. </p>
      <p>The only other option I can think of is taking your car to Macco, getting 
        it painted a different color, and then saying, &quot;What car?&quot; the 
        next time your roommate asks to use it. I'd go with telling your roommate 
        that it's your parents' car and they are letting you use it under the 
        agreement that you are the only one driving it. Stress the part about 
        the insurance, and admit that you used &quot;bad judgment&quot; before.</p>
      <p>Let your roommate know that you'll give her lifts when the two of you 
        are going the same way; you'll come across in a favorable light. What 
        I do not advise is offering to drive your roommate wherever she wants 
        to go whenever she wants to go there. Inevitably, this will lead to another 
        problem, and you'll just be writing in next week about how your roommate 
        treats you like her chauffeur. <br>
