        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">Not everyone gets to be Tom Brady. Two years ago, he made 
        the flawless transition from sixth-round draft pick to Super Bowl MVP 
        and the NFL's new &quot;golden boy.&quot; The combination of a storybook 
        Super Bowl season, good looks, and a very marketable personality ensured 
        that Tom Brady posters were on walls in bedrooms all across America. </p>
      <p>Tom should feel fortunate, as there are very few players who can exceed 
        the expectations of fans so tremendously. He represents one extreme end 
        of the spectrum. </p>
      <p>On the other end of the spectrum is the Anti-Brady. There is perhaps 
        no player who better fills this role than Minnesota Vikings wide reciever 
        Randy Moss. There is nothing that sports fans hate more than talented 
        players with discipline problems who constantly underachieve. Once a player 
        has been branded with one of these labels, or both in Moss's case, it 
        is nearly impossible for him to clear his name. </p>
      <p>The discipline problems of Randy Moss are well-documented, and go all 
        the way back to his high school days. A racially-driven fight during his 
        senior year of high school was the first in a series of discipline problems 
        that would cost him numerous opportunities throughout his career. Because 
        of this fight, Moss lost his golden opportunity to play for Lou Holtz 
        at the University of Notre Dame. In the summer of 1996, after his redshirt 
        year at Florida State, Moss tested positive for marijuana and was once 
        again forced to forfeit an opportunity to play for an elite program. </p>
      <p>And so it came that Randy Moss, the most athletically-gifted football 
        player to come out of high school in a decade, the player who had been 
        dubbed by the Great Lou Holtz as &quot;the best athlete I have ever seen,&quot; 
        was headed to play for the then-Division I-AA Marshall Thundering Herd, 
        bringing a lot of excess baggage with him. </p>
      <p>Despite keeping clean for two years and establishing himself as one of 
        the greatest college football receivers of all time, there were many NFL 
        teams that hesitated to take a chance on Moss because of his past. Nineteen 
        of them to be exact. The Minnesota Vikings drafted Moss with the 21st 
        pick, and he proved to be just as much of a handful for them as he was 
        for the teams who defended him on the field. </p>
      <p>Since coming to the NFL, Moss has had several run-ins with the law, the 
        most recent being an altercation with a traffic officer last season. It 
        is not difficult to understand why fans find fault in his off-the-field 
        behavior. Many of his actions are inexcusable and would be punished more 
        severely were Moss not a professional athlete. </p>
      <p>Moss is by no stretch of the imagination the first athlete who has found 
        himself in legal trouble. Lawrence Taylor, the great New York Giants linebacker, 
        had a history of cocaine abuse, yet today he still stands as one of the 
        most beloved players in New York sports history. Theoren Fleury, a very 
        talented winger who currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks, carries 
        excess baggage with him wherever he goes to play. Fleury's actions have 
        had a serious impact on his team lately, as he missed almost all of last 
        season. Yet people still love Theo Fleury. </p>
      <p>On the whole, sports fans have never taking a liking to Randy Moss. Even 
        after Moss publicly apologized for his behavior last year, and vowed that 
        he would turn over a new leaf, fans still refuse to shed their negative 
        views of him. So, what I want to know is this: Why is nobody willing to 
        look past the personal problems of Randy Moss and appreciate him for his 
        abilities as a football player? The answer is clear, but does not make 
        much sense: fans view Moss as an underachiever. </p>
      <p>Ever since signing his second contract, which made him the highest paid 
        wide receiver in the NFL, Moss has been criticized by fans and players 
        for being an underachiever. If this claim is true, then I would like to 
        see what an over-achiever looks like. Moss has been nothing short of dominant 
        since he entered the NFL in 1998. In fact, in the five full seasons that 
        Moss has played he has recorded 414 receptions for 6,743 yards. That is 
        more receptions and more yards than Jerry Rice had after his first five 
        years. It is more than Marvin Harrison had after his first five seasons. 
        In fact, it is more than ANY RECIEVER in NFL history has ever had in their 
        first five years. In those five years he had 61 touchdowns. The only player 
        to have more touchdowns than Moss since 1998 is Rams running-back Marshall 
        Faulk, who was the feature weapon in an offense that averaged more points 
        than any team in history. </p>
      <p>People have also criticized Moss' lack of toughness, saying that he often 
        puts himself ahead of the team. However, Moss has played in all 80 of 
        the Vikings games since he has entered the league, starting in 75 of them. 
        Certainly, if Moss were as soft as people claim, there would have been 
        physical ailments somewhere along the way (he does play professional football) 
        that would have caused him to miss a game. People have claimed that Moss' 
        productivity dropped after his first two years, and that he has not been 
        playing as well since he signed his big contract. However, this is also 
        not true. Moss is only getting better, and 2002 was the best season, statistically 
        speaking, that he has had yet. At this point in his career, Randy Moss 
        is on pace to be the most productive receiver in NFL history. </p>
      <p>It is for this reason that I cannot view Moss as an underachiever. However, 
        it has been known to the football public over the past few seasons that 
        Moss' off-season work habits left something to be desired. </p>
      <p>This off-season was different. After the team's mini-camps in Winter 
        Park, head coach Mike Tice made a point of mentioning that Moss, along 
        with Chris Hovan and Daunte Culpepper, stood out as one of the hardest 
        workers in mini-camp, and that he had seemed to be stepping into a leadership 
        role on the team. This is a void that had needed filling on this team 
        since the retirement of Cris Carter and the death of Korey Stringer. </p>
      <p>In mid-August, reports broke that Moss had not spent the summer playing 
        semi-pro basketball as he usually does. He had instead been involved in 
        a rigorous training program in Florida that involved sprinting on beaches 
        with a weighted harness. He was reportedly more explosive, and had gained 
        ten pounds of muscle. It was not the physical aspect of this report that 
        was the most intriguing, as Moss has always been physically superior to 
        his opponents for all of his life. What seemed more important was that 
        Moss was starting to mature, and become a leader on his team. He has been 
        superb so far this year, torching teams that try to play single coverage 
        against him, and eating up the double coverage of other teams while creating 
        plays for the other offensive players. </p>
      <p>Maybe this will be the year that Randy Moss finally gets the recognition 
        he deserves. He made a statement to his critics on Sunday in a much hyped-up 
        home game against the San Francisco 49ers, and their stud wide-receiver 
        Terell Owens. Before the game, the strong majority of analysts had made 
        it clear that they would take Owens over Moss if they were the General 
        Manager of a team. Moss had been suffering all week from back spasms, 
        and his starting quarterback, Daunte Culpepper, was not playing because 
        of broken bones in his back. If ever there was a situation made for underachievers 
        struggling to live up to their title, this was it. However, it was Randy 
        Moss who walked off the field victorious on Sunday. Eight catches, 172 
        yards, 3 Tds, and a 4-0 record.<br>
