      <p align="left">Unlike 15th century Mediterranean merchants, the chefs at 
        Richard's Restaurant on Maine Street may purchase salt and other preservative 
        spices at a cheap price. They don't have to hijack lobster boats to the 
        West Indies; cartons of Morton's and McCormick line the shelves of Hannaford 
        right across the street. Why, then, is Richard's food so bland?</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie is unfamiliar with German cuisine. Perhaps it is dull by nature, 
        in which case her complaints are invalid. Even if, however, this regional 
        aliment is not as flavorful as that of nations lining the equator, it 
        must still be pleasing to the palate. A lover of chili peppers, the Foodie 
        tolerates tamer cuisines so long as they incorporate other flavors. She 
        is sure that German food must have more flavor than Richard's would have 
        her believe.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bland dishes mirrored a lifeless dining environment. Not only was the 
        Foodie dining alone, but she was also the only patron in the entire restaurant. 
        What a lonely meal! Thank goodness she had her copy of Copenhagen, a play 
        that coincidentally concerns Danish and German nuclear physicists, for 
        company. Perhaps Werner Heisenberg, a central figure in Michael Frayn's 
        play, consumed the very kinds of dishes described on Richard's menu. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If he were not just a figment of the Foodie's imagination, but actually 
        sitting across from her, perhaps Heisenberg would have ordered one of 
        Richard's sausage dishes with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, stewed 
        red cabbage, spaeztle or green beans. He might also have been delighted 
        by the various kinds of hamburgers, salads, and flaky turnovers presented 
        on the menu. Heisenberg might have exploded like two unstable chemicals 
        in a beaker if he knew that Richard's offers a German Sampler, which provides, 
        as the menu describes, &quot;a trip to Germany without even leaving Brunswick!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie decided to order a dish less filling than bratwurst, knackwurst 
        or Wienerschnitzel for her lunch. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Grilled chicken with leek and mushroom sauce filled her for the afternoon, 
        despite the dish's supposed small portion size. Sour, slightly mushy stewed 
        red cabbage and a tough whole-wheat dumpling the size of a golf ball accompanied 
        the entr&eacute;e. Although the mushrooms were not fresh, the sauce they 
        swam in was warm and made on-site. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The plate of food was neatly presented, but the chicken needed a kick. 
        Salt, a natural monosodium glutamate for its ability to enhance inherent 
        flavors, was in desperate need. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sadly, the Foodie took it upon herself to sprinkle some atop the breast. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie firmly believes that the addition of one's own salt and pepper 
        is just not necessary in a proper dining establishment! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Supplements to the meal were also almost pleasurable. A cup of German 
        Peasant Soup was thick and hearty, but bland like the entr&eacute;e. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Two buttery popovers arrived with the Foodie's chicken in a black wire 
        basket. Their heat and asymmetrical shape indicated their origin in a 
        Richard's oven. More flaky than eggy, these pastries might not have been 
        faithful popover renditions but they were nevertheless tasty. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Exposed brick, dark wood paneling, dim lights and &quot;traditional&quot; 
        German music create a cozy, if not parodic, atmosphere. While the food 
        is priced a bit high for Brunswick, service is fast and friendly, and 
        the Foodie would most likely return to sample a German sausage if coerced.
