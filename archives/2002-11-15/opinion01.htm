        <font size="2">MACAELA FLANAGAN</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Compilations are a confusing instrument in the music world. 
        They aren't a progressive idea like an original album, but instead the 
        songs are plucked from various trees in the musical history orchard and 
        placed into the same basket. That means you could have a song by someone 
        as wonderful as Janis Joplin followed by someone as horrid as Yanni. No, 
        it probably wouldn't happen, but it could. And that is why compilations 
        are scary: they have the capacity to be very, very bad. If an album is 
        horrible, at least you can write the band off and never listen to them 
        again. But if a song near and dear to your heart is followed by something 
        that makes your stomach turn, if you're anything like me, you get very 
        offended.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are varying forms of compilations including everything from MTV 
        Party to Go to Sounds of the 70s and everything in-between. Because these 
        mixes come in such a vast assortment, the musical quality scale ranges 
        from the first-class to bottom of the barrel. Buying a compilation is 
        taking a chance. But let's face it, compilations are as important to your 
        generic college party as Natty Light. No one puts on a full-length album 
        at a big party. Instead you get a range of some specific musical genre 
        depending on your host's tastes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you've ever poked around a Wal-Mart music section, besides realizing 
        that it sucks (unless you like Faith Hill), you will notice they do have 
        an impressive selection of Now That's What I Call Music! compilations. 
        How about that's what I call crap. The newest member of the Now That's 
        What&#133; family, volume 11, is to be released on November 19. Warning: 
        if I hear anyone on campus playing it I will hunt you down and force you 
        to mutilate your CD. You'll thank me. Tracks on the unreleased compilation 
        include, but are not limited to, such vomit-inducing pseudo-musicians 
        as Creed and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Like a bad accident, I couldn't look 
        away. I had to check volume 10: NSYNC, J-Lo, the Baha Men. Volume 9: more 
        of volume 10&#133; but wait! What are U2, Mary J. Blige, and Incubus doing 
        on the same album with Britney?!</p>
      <p align="left">
        On a more comforting note, movie soundtracks often supply the best compilations. 
        Maybe that is because your favorite songs combined with amazing movies 
        can equal nothing but pure bliss. It's a pretty simple formula: think 
        of a great song, plus a great movie, plus a favorite actor and you have 
        success. Example: The Rolling Stones + Mean Streets + Harvey Kietel and 
        Robert DeNiro = wonderful. Jefferson Airplane + Fear and Loathing in Las 
        Vegas + Johnny Depp = harmony. Queen + Wayne's World + Dana Carvey and 
        Mike Myers = perfection! On the other hand, if you have a bad song paired 
        with a bad movie, you have complete evil. Avril Lavigne + Sweet Home Alabama 
        + Reese Witherspoon = abysmal.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sometimes people just get too carried away with the thought of combining 
        their favorite songs. Did you know there is actually a compilation called 
        the Copulation Compilation? No, I do not own it. If you are going to be 
        so tacky as to actually make an &quot;I'm-going-to-get-laid&quot; mix, 
        at least don't make it blatant. On www.amazon.com they even have a place 
        to post your own musical mixes for certain moods. There was this one guy, 
        a self proclaimed &quot;music consumer/glutton,&quot; who made a &quot;Bubble 
        Bath List-Music to Soak By.&quot; Yeah, it's weird. His list included 
        Barbara Streisand. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In retrospect, it is clear that in order for a compilation to be successful, 
        the creator must put some tender loving care into her selections. A compilation 
        bible would be Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction soundtrack; where as Rhino 
        Records' Heartthrob Hits! can burn in compilation hell as far as I am 
        concerned. However, if you're in the mood for one type of music and one 
        type only, a compilation can be your answer; just be aware that you are 
        taking the artist's work and removing it from its original element. Despite 
        artists' intents, compilations are popular. Totally Hits 2002: More Platinum 
        Hits and Totally Country Vol. 2 are 21 and 23 on the Billboard Charts 
        this week, respectively. Two fine examples of what makes 90 percent of 
        all compilations &quot;totally&quot; worthless.</p>
