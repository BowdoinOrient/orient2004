        <font size="2">ERIK SPRAGUE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The New England Patriots achieved arguably the biggest comeback 
        in franchise history last Sunday. The Patriots trailed the Chicago Bears, 
        27-6, with just over two minutes remaining in the third quarter, when 
        they went on a 30-3 run to end the game to squeak out a much-needed 33-30 
        road victory at Memorial Stadium in Champlain, Illinois.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the Patriots' 38-7 victory over the Buffalo Bills the prior Sunday, 
        they finally resembled the team that had won the Super Bowl just ten months 
        earlier. They had a balanced attack of passing and running the football; 
        they got back to having quarterback Tom Brady throw the short screen passes 
        that were so effective last year and using running back Antowain Smith 
        to run the ball hard up the middle in order to punish the Bills' defense 
        while churning out three and four yards on first down. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This balance resulted in the Patriots controlling the clock and keeping 
        the Bills, Bledsoe, and their second-leading passing attack in the NFL 
        off the field, as well as tiring a Bills defense that had spent a significant 
        amount of time on the field by the end of the game.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many in the media, especially those from New England, are using the Chicago 
        game as further evidence that the Patriots are back to their Super Bowl 
        form from last year. While the Patriots offense did indeed look unstoppable 
        against a weak Bears defense (not including the play of linebacker Brian 
        Urlacher) during the final minutes of the third quarter and throughout 
        the fourth quarter as well, the Patriots did not look like the same team 
        that won the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p align="left">
        First off, during last year's streak, when they ran off six straight victories 
        to end the regular season, they very rarely got behind in a game, let 
        alone behind by 21 points like they did on Sunday. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It is also difficult to overlook the fact that for almost three fourths 
        of the football game, both the Patriots' offense and defense looked stagnant 
        and got pushed around by a Bears team that looked like a tougher and hungrier 
        squad-even though the Bears have only one win on the season and are all 
        but out of the playoff picture.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Moreover, what is with the Patriots' play calling? Last year, one of the 
        keys to the Patriots' success was their balance on offense. Offensive 
        coordinator Charlie Weiss threw at opposing defenses a mixture of runs 
        and passes, and varied the downs on which the Patriots would run and pass. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many times opponents looked to be at the mercy of the Patriots' highly 
        efficient, balanced, and unpredictable offensive game plan. Conversely, 
        this year Weiss has all of sudden gotten rid of any previous disposition 
        towards a balanced offense. The Patriots on average pass the ball more 
        than they run it by a 2:1 ratio. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The majority opinion of the media is that the Patriots have been passing 
        this season to such a greater extent than last season because their running 
        attack is nonexistent. And, the media likes to place the blame for the 
        Patriots' inefficient running game on the shoulders of Antowoin Smith, 
        who they claim has lost a step, which is, according to them, evidenced 
        by the fact that he failed the condition test in preseason. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, although statistics can lie, I don't think they do in the case 
        of Antowain, whose 4.3 yards-per-carry stacks up favorably with some of 
        the elite running backs in the NFL. For instance, Ricky Williams averages 
        4.1 yards per carry, a slightly smaller margin than Antowain, and Corey 
        Dillon gains 4.3 yards per carry, the same as Antowain. Williams and Dillon 
        are ranked fifth and sixth, respectively, in the NFL as far as rushing 
        yards gained. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, Antowain is tied for seventeeth with the aging Emmitt Smith. 
        The reason is that Williams and Dillon each have received the ball about 
        fifty times more than Antowain, which is a considerable margin considering 
        the season is only half-way over. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Granted, there is no guarantee that Antowain would keep his same efficient 
        yards-per-carry average if his number of carries per game increased. Moreover, 
        as his critics quickly point out, a portion of Antwoain's yards gained 
        have come at the end of games when the score was already decided-whether 
        it be in a Patriots' victory or loss. That may be. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Yet this is a common occurrence for all backs, whose job it is to protect 
        large leads, and who, when their team is trailing by a significant amount, 
        sometimes benefit from gaining easy yards against prevent defenses.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The point is that the Patriots are a different team than last season's; 
        they have become a passing team and, for whatever reason, have opted to 
        only give Antowain the ball sparingly. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They have looked impressive in their last two victories, but they are 
        not playing as well as last year, and they have yet to beat a powerhouse 
        team like Green Bay, Denver, or Miami. Oakland on the road will be a big 
        test this weekend. And, they might even be able to win it by solely relying 
        on quarterback Tom Brady's arm. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But eventually, if they fail to give Antowain the ball more, the lack 
        of a legitimate running game to compliment Brady will end up costing them 
        against the better teams in the league. The key to getting back to the 
        Super Bowl might not be as simple as giving the ball more to Antowain 
        Smith, but the road to the Super Bowl definitely goes through #32. </p>
