      <p align="left">Bowdoin Security dispatcher Lester Wood received a call 
        at 8:42 p.m. on Saturday, November 9 from a student in the Outing Club 
        cabin in Monson, Maine informing Security that she and her swim teammates 
        were feeling threatened by people lurking outside. Because the cabin was 
        four and a half hours away from Bowdoin, Wood told her to immediately 
        call 911. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A group of 20 girls from the swim team had gone to the Outing Club cabin 
        as part of a team bonding retreat. Alison Benton '03, one of the team 
        captains, related the what happened when they arrived at the cabin, &quot;These 
        guys came down from the cabins and offered to help us with our stuff&#133;but 
        then started drinking beer.&quot; The three men were employees of the 
        Middlesex Movers Company from outside of Boston and were between the ages 
        of 25 and 45 years. After leaving for a short time, the men &quot;came 
        back with a thirty pack of beer.&quot; Benton and Alicia Smith '04, another 
        team, both reported that &quot;one of them was obviously drunk.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Everyone was uncomfortable&quot; said Smith, &quot;and they hadn't 
        asked to be let in but just sort of walked into the cabin.&quot; Eventually, 
        Benton asked the men to leave, but the team &quot;kept hearing noises 
        outside.&quot; When one of the teammates went out to relieve herself and 
        then returned to the cabin, &quot;there was a guy crouching beneath one 
        of the windows with a beer in his hand&quot; said Benton. The teammate 
        was greatly disturbed and as the man ran off away from the cabin, she 
        bolted into the front door. Because, according to Benton, &quot;the front 
        door can't be locked from the inside,&quot; the team blockaded the door 
        as best they could, locked the back door, and covered all the windows. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Benton described how the men continued to taunt them, &quot;[we] continued 
        to hear their voices for another half an hour.&quot; One of the girls 
        on the team had a cell phone, and after calling security, she called the 
        police. When the state police officer arrived at 10:19 p.m., he reprimanded 
        the men. However, Smith was &quot;appalled that the police officer did 
        not act more aggressively&quot; towards three men who had been harassing 
        a group of girls out in the middle of the woods. The officer then &quot;escorted 
        us down the hill back to the vans and we left that night instead of staying 
        overnight.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;No one had been harmed,&quot; commented Benton &quot;the guys had 
        just been really creepy.&quot; She went on to say that the whole experience 
        really &quot;brought out for us the fact that if one older guy had been 
        there with us, it probably would not have happened. It's so easy for guys 
        to take advantage of the situation-a group of secluded girls.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact that the police did not take more severe action against the men 
        was also disturbing for the members of the girl's swim team. Under Maine 
        State law, harassment is defined as &quot;Three or more acts of intimidation, 
        confrontation, physical force or the threat of physical force directed 
        against any person&#133;intimidation or damage to property and that do 
        in fact cause fear&quot; or &quot;three or more acts that are made with 
        the intent to deter the free exercise or enjoyment of any rights or privileges 
        secured by the Constitution of Maine or the United States Constitution.&quot; 
        The girls on the swim team felt that their experience met these definitions, 
        and they were upset by the fact that the police officer's attitude towards 
        the whole situation was that &quot;it was just a few guys being bothersome,&quot; 
        said Smith.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The swim team arrived safely back at Bowdoin College, but Benton commented 
        that few of the girls will want to return to the scene of such an unsettling 
        experience. Josh Rudner '03, president of the Outing Club, commented that 
        the Outing Club is &quot;still in the process of getting more information&quot; 
        and will not officially respond to the incident until next week.</p>
