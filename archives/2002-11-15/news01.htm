        <font size="2">ANN SULLIVAN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Does the early bird really get the worm? According to Bowdoin, 
        this isn't necessarily the case. Year after year, by mid-November the 
        admissions office is flooded with early decision applications from hopeful 
        students across the United States and the world; however, this option 
        is being phased out at many colleges across the nation.</p>
      <p align="left">Last week Yale and Stanford announced the end of their early 
        decision days. According to the Washington Post, &quot;the combined effect 
        will put pressure on other colleges to do the same or risk losing in the 
        competition for some of the best applicants.&quot; With many schools instituting 
        this shift, some might expect Bowdoin to follow suit, but Jim Miller, 
        Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, stated that, &quot;for the short 
        term I think we are happy with what [early decision] does for us.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Early decision was originally instituted solely to help students get through 
        the hassle of the college process sooner and with better-suited results. 
        Over the years, some schools have dropped this agreement for one reason 
        or another. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Miller believes that early decision has &quot;mutated nationally because 
        some schools use it to inflate their rating in U.S. News and World Report 
        and to control financial aid expenditure&quot; but he reiterated that 
        Bowdoin &quot;[tries] hard to stick to the original idea.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Every year the number of applications for this option increases. This 
        time last year, there were approximately 420 applicants, 175 of whom were 
        accepted for the class of 2006, which is made of about 450 students-meaning 
        about 38 percent were accepted early decision. This figure is significantly 
        higher than the 23-24 percent overall admit rate.</p>
      <p align="left">
        These numbers indicate that early decision yields a benefit, and Miller 
        did admit that &quot;statistically there is an advantage, there is a slightly 
        higher admit rate.&quot; Yet, he emphasized that &quot;[admissions officers] 
        try not to make different decisions. [They] try to make the same decision 
        early that [they] would make regular.&quot; Miller continued, stating 
        that they &quot;do not want to advantage or disadvantage people&quot; 
        and that the higher admittance rate in early decision is skewed as a result 
        of many things. For instance, legacy cases generally apply early and most 
        athletic recruiting occurs during this process.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Though many colleges are reevaluating the purpose of early decision application, 
        Miller believes that it is &quot;good for students to have the option 
        to apply early, get a decision, and enjoy their senior year with out the 
        pressure of the college applications.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        While some schools who discontinued the option feel that students may 
        rush the choice, admissions has conducted extensive research which found 
        that their early decision students did not feel as though they made hasty 
        or premature decisions and that graduation rates for early decision applicants 
        are the same or higher than those who applied regular. Furthermore, Miller 
        noted that &quot;some of our best students and alums have been early decision 
        [applicants].&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Miller provided a final word of wisdom regarding this process, &quot;[admissions 
        knows] it is a big issue for families and for students and [that] there's 
        a lot of folk wisdom in general about how families feel like [they[ have 
        to game the early decision process a little bit-that [they] have to try 
        to figure out how to beat it or how use it-but [we] try very hard to play 
        it straight and use it the way it was intended.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Early decision applications for the class of 2007 are due Friday, November 
        15, 2002.</p>
