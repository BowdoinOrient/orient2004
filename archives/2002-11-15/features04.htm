        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The past week has been a strenuous one for the markets. 
        Over the past week we have have the Chairman of Securities and Exchange 
        Commission, Harvey Pitt, resign due to pressure over his past and his 
        appointment of William Webster to run the accounting oversight board. 
        Then William Webster himself resigned from the accounting board due to 
        controversy from his involvement in U.S. Technologies. Less noticed, though, 
        the SEC's chief accountant, Robert K. Herdman, also quit for his part 
        in the selection Webster to run the accounting oversight board. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Interestingly though, the news has had little effect on the markets as 
        they have stayed relatively stable over the past week, with most days 
        seeing little or no change. News like this in the middle of the summer 
        would have been disastrous for the market, resulting in the Dow decreasing 
        hundreds of points. Last Thursday the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 
        at 8586.26 and this Thursday it closed at 8542.13. This is a rather insignificant 
        change in the Dow-only about a half percent difference. This was helped 
        by the strong performance of the Dow this Thursday, gaining 143.64 points. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The most interesting news from this past week relates to retail sales. 
        Retail sales for October were flat, beating many analysts' expectations. 
        The retail sales, although flat, are up from 1.3 percent decline in September. 
        This should be seen as good news for another reason. Flat retail, despite 
        diminishing sales in the auto industry, could be seen as a sign of the 
        economy recovering. Some people might see this as negative because auto 
        sales slipping might lead some to believe that one of the best parts of 
        the economy are slipping and would take the rest of the economy with it. 
        The rise in GDP to 3.1 percent in the third quarter was due largely to 
        the success of the auto industry over the summer. However, I view the 
        stability of retail sales as a sign of recovery. The stability of retail 
        sales, despite increasing weakness in the auto industry implies that other 
        sectors of the economy are starting to pick up the slack, which I view 
        as a sign that the economy could be starting to recover.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In support of this view of a possible recovery, Alan Greenspan said to 
        Congress yesterday in his testimony that &quot;the economy's most likely 
        projection is to come out of this soft spot and to start accelerating.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        He also hinted at the possibility of an interest rate increase, which 
        indicates more concern about inflation than the status of the economy. 
        However, being the smart man that he is, Greenspan covered himself, saying 
        there is a possibility of further rate cuts if the economy begins to slip 
        again. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The biggest obstacle for the economy to overcome is investor confidence. 
        As I said last week, the weakest part of the economy has been business 
        investment, the result of a lack of consumer confidence. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The stability of the markets despite a pretty shaky week, seems to indicate 
        that investor confidence is at least on the rise and that the performance 
        of the market despite bad news implies that investors are not as flighty 
        as they were during the summer amid the wealth of corporate scandals. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Investor confidence still needs to rise more-not to the irrational levels 
        of the late nineties, but enough to help insure the recovery of the economy.</p>
