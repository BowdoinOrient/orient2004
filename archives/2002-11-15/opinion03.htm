        <font size="2">ACADIA SENESE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I waste more time in my life wandering the aisles of Wal-Mart 
        than anything else. I hate the store; it sucks me into the vortex of blue 
        bags and yellow smiley faces and doesn't let me leave until I've seen 
        every Maine character imaginable and purchased some irrelevant 99 cent 
        item.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Wal-Mart is the complete manifestation of both American consumerism and 
        Maine culture in one conveniently located place. Not only does an enormous 
        American flag greet us as we enter the store-made from colored plastic 
        bins from an Asian country-but the store bombards us through all walks 
        of life. Even people who never go out, who never see the light of day, 
        who never interact with others, must go to Wal-Mart. They must get their 
        Christmas decorations the day after Halloween; they must get the discount 
        garden supplies even though it's snowing; and they must buy cheap discount 
        soda because Wal-Mart tells them they should.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are five kinds of people at Wal-Mart. The first are large families-herds 
        if you will. There's usually a mother, and a father-smaller and frailer 
        than the woman-lagging somewhat behind. The mother leads the way, with 
        three kids clutching the carriage. She insists that they check out the 
        home goods section, and the husband, too whipped to object, secretly wants 
        to check out the hunting weapons. The kids cry for toys, but it's only 
        dishtowels and laundry detergent for them today.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are tough men-men that just rolled out from under a car after having 
        completed their tenth oil change of the day. These men wear orange vests, 
        go directly to where the orange vests can be found, talk only to other 
        men wearing orange vests, and make no remark to the checkout lady who 
        says Bambi is cute. They drive pick-up trucks, and could care less if 
        Wal-Mart, and all its workers, fell off the face of the earth. There are 
        other places to get orange vests.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are really old people-people that not only need a carriage to hold 
        things, but to hold them up. These people go really slowly, check out 
        every price that ends in eleven cents, and hold up the aisles ad infinitum. 
        They can care less if they run your heals over. They're seasoned Wal-Mart 
        shoppers and nothing gets between them and their discounts. They know 
        the store inside and out, and are better to ask than Wal-Mart workers 
        if you need to find something.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are Bowdoin students. Yes, plenty of Bowdoin students. Stuck up 
        and too good for Wal-Mart, they try feverishly to rush through the place. 
        They don't interact with Mainers, but like to think they can joke around 
        with the checkout lady. They're really only there because 1) they can't 
        afford to shop elsewhere and 2) they really need some silly outfit or 
        an upcoming party. They like to be politically correct and say that Wal-Mart 
        is a bad thing, but they shop there nonetheless. Bowdoin students are 
        the Wal-Mart hypocrites.</p>
      <p align="left">
        And then there is the lost sole. Alone, meandering, confused, frustrated, 
        angry, and searching for a breath of fresh air, this person entered Wal-Mart 
        with the intention of buying only a single item, but after a maze of aisles, 
        and pushing through crowds, they soon forgot why the hell they came to 
        Wal-Mart in the first place. By the time they get to the check out they 
        have everything but what they came for. As they wait in a long line, they 
        breathe deeply, trying to find the oxygen they unwillingly checked at 
        the door. They swear under their breath, and promise they'll never, ever 
        return. But they'll be back. Everyone comes back.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I am that lost soul, and I hate every minute of being in Wal-Mart. I always 
        swear I'll never come back, that I won't allow Wal-Mart to throw a plastic 
        American flag in my face and claim to be patriotic, that I won't allow 
        some crazy old lady to run over my heels, nor will I allow the screaming 
        kids attached to the carriage drive me nuts. But as I stand in line behind 
        a hunter, and try to count how many Bowdoin kids I just ran into, I realize 
        that yes, I too am the Bowdoin hypocrite. And damn the fact that I shop 
        at Wal-Mart because, business ethics aside, I'm no yellow smiley face 
        by the time I escape the store.</p>
