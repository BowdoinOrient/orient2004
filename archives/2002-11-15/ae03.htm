      <p>The stage blossomed in an array of color and finery as dancers wafted 
        on and off the stage, performing a diversity of dances that reached back 
        to the origins of Korean dance, rhythm, and music. Beautifully subtle 
        movements were the medium of choice. However, the understated gestures 
        were, on occasion, punctuated by dynamic movements that conveyed the enormous 
        energy being harnessed by each dancer. The result: presentations that 
        were at once stirring and full of graceful calm. </p>
      <p>The group that achieved these colorful results-turning a dead stage into 
        a garden of life-is called Hanguk. The group performed as a part of a 
        slew of events in last weekend's Invitational with a diversity of artistic 
        forms. Hanguk is a group based out of New York City that performs traditional 
        Korean dance and music in costumes that are breathtaking and with discipline 
        that is practically otherworldly. </p>
      <p>The group began the night by performing improvisational folkdance, emphasizing 
        joy and style and reflecting humanity's rigorous zeal to survive. Although 
        no loner improvised, this dance set reflected the kind of movements and 
        gestures originally used in improvisational dancing. Hanguk followed this 
        set by performing the Dance of Extract-a number in which the use of fans 
        is meant to recall forms of landscape. </p>
      <p>Hanguk then went on to perform a Militaristic Dance in which subtle movements 
        were punctuated by snapping sounds as fans opened and closed. The gentle 
        movements that the pair of dancers performed were alternated with the 
        quick energetic ones that occasionally excited the stage like sudden blooms 
        of a rare flower. </p>
      <p>After a short break, Hanguk performed the Dancing Drum, which was originally 
        designed for performance on the battlefield following the conclusion of 
        a fray. Four dancers circled around a central drum and, mixing the ideas 
        of music and dance, the dancers played a part in the traditional music. 
      </p>
      <p>Thus, it was as if the dancers were as much a part of the music as the 
        music was part of the dance steps that they performed. This dynamic is 
        an important one to recognize in understanding traditional Korean dance. 
        A dazzling Fan Dance-whose origins can be traced back to the 18th century-followed. 
        Fans are thought to expel evil and bring prosperity in Korean mythology. 
        As the fans snapped open and closed, forming the shapes of flowers that 
        lived for a few seconds on stage and then disappeared into thin air-the 
        magical form of the fan was truly made apparent. A Shamen Ceremonial Dance 
        followed in which a solo dancer dressed in white filled the stage with 
        her understated movements-mimicking the graceful shapes made by the white 
        scarf she held. This dance represented the most powerful expression of 
        grief and longing. </p>
      <p>The final dance was a pure crowed pleaser. The Drum Dance filled the 
        stage with unceasing rhythm and excitement that left the heart beating 
        more rapidly. In Korean mythology, the drum is seen as an earthly symbol 
        of heaven. Indeed, the thunderous sound of the drums was intoxicating 
        and all thoughts of trouble slipped away-replaced by the heady splendor 
        of the intricate pulses. </p>
