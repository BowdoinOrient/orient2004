        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> For most of my life, I have been tagged the model student 
        and daughter, not because I have been either, but because I've merely 
        seemed to be. Working hard and getting good grades go a long way in determining 
        the way people view us, often inaccurately. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I have always struggled with speaking about personal issues and problems, 
        so for a very long time, I simply didn't speak. In my last years of high 
        school, I spent hours in my guidance counselor's office, literally incapable 
        of saying even the simplest words. I just sat in silence. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I am finally beginning to understand fragments of the reasons behind that 
        silence. I was taught to rely only on myself, not to invest in relationships. 
        My family always had high, often unspoken expectations. They wanted me 
        to lose weight. I did. It wasn't enough. I progressively starved myself, 
        until I woke up in the mornings, shaking. Malnutrition. In high school, 
        a girl I barely knew told me she was cutting. She thought I would do something 
        to help her, because none of her friends could. One of my friends committed 
        suicide around the same time. I had thought about suicide, years before, 
        but the memories remain real.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The culture of success is a culture of silence. But here is the irony. 
        All these issues, these struggles that we are claiming as marginal, taking 
        place &quot;in the shadows&quot;-they are central, essential. They, and 
        nothing else, hold us together. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I almost transferred at the end of last year to go to a more intellectually 
        driven institution, but I stayed because I believe that Bowdoin presents 
        the possibilities for very human connections that we are all desperately 
        in need of finding. I stayed because two of my professors helped me believe 
        in those possibilities. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I didn't come back to Bowdoin to change it. I came back to make it what 
        I need for it to be. I came back so we could vitally engage each other. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Last Friday, in his common hour talk, Bob Vilas mentioned that relationships 
        are by far the most important factor of healing. And to me, that statement 
        pinpointed a painful deficiency in our culture. We need to live for relationships. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Before I end, I want to address students and faculty directly, because 
        the only way for this place to change is for individuals to change.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Students: Forget the idea that college is supposed to be the best four 
        years of our lives. What a sad concept-that the best will be over when 
        we graduate. These four years are the only time we are encouraged to ask 
        searching questions and experiment with different answers to find ideas 
        that make sense to us. Engage in those questions. Converse. Conversations 
        build the relationships that must sustain us. We need relationships, not 
        drinking buddies. We need to be demanding of ourselves and of everyone 
        around us. We all deserve to be here, but we deserve even more to get 
        what we need from this place and the people here. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Faculty: I cannot tell you how many times I have wanted to speak these 
        words, but I haven't known how to. I am here for an academic education 
        that must be personal. I want to learn from you, to talk to you, to write 
        to you. I want to know you. I want, no, I need relationships, and I know 
        I am not exceptional. You are the ones who can break the silence and sustain 
        the students on this campus. We want something more than what we are getting-to 
        be vitally and personally engaged. We just don't know how to ask. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Change happens within people, before it can grow outwards. We can't accept 
        a Bowdoin that leaves us unfulfilled, nor can we just forget everything 
        and start over. So, we walk around, semi-conscious that something is not 
        quite right. But we have the ability to create change, to engage the questions 
        and struggles that must challenge us to be more than what we are. We just 
        need to re-value what we have, for each other's sake. For sustenance.
