      <p align="left">Those days of suffering and separation, however, were in 
        the future-not far in the future but in the future nonetheless. In the 
        meantime there was still the busy business of living. Bowdoin played host 
        to its annual house parties that cold Maine winter by inviting to campus 
        some of the prettiest girls on the eastern seaboards. Along to provide 
        entertainment was Artie Shaw and his band. As the undergraduates danced 
        and celebrated life in the chilly night there was happiness and enthusiasm 
        in the air. In the town of Brunswick there was also celebration that Christmas 
        season as Bowdoin fraternities donated $140 for holiday dinners and gifts-feeding 
        up to 230 Brunswick citizens. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For the Class of 1941, the daily routine of Bowdoin life slowly became 
        habit. They went to Chapel, they went to classes, ate in the Moulton Union, 
        served at the whim of their upper-class brothers, debated issues, practiced 
        sports, and generally tried to enjoy their time at Bowdoin. In many ways 
        life was simpler and easier. Rail communications with Boston and Portland 
        were established and the railroad station was a quick walk away. Laundry 
        was even easier; all a student had to do (if he lived within a few states 
        of Maine) was to drop his dirty cloths in a basket, send it down by rail 
        to his parents and wait for it to be returned. So successful was this 
        operation that the Railway Express could afford to print an ad, complete 
        with photograph, in the student paper. &quot;Whether it's send collect 
        or prepaid&quot; the ad read, &quot;your laundry always arrives quickly, 
        safely, by Railway Express-the favorite laundry route of generations of 
        college men and women.&quot; Young Everett Parker Pope from North Quincy, 
        Massachusetts, a member of the Class of 1941, was one such individual 
        who enjoyed this service. &quot;We used to send [the laundry] home to 
        my mother and that had some advantages,&quot; he remembers-these advantages 
        being brownies or other such treats in the laundry basket when it returned.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The young men of Bowdoin could thus concentrate on their work and fun. 
        In the spring of 1938, almost a year after the Class of 1941 had come 
        to the campus, they began to try out for Walsh's Polar Bear football team. 
        eighty-four reported to the coach, including a handsome fullback named 
        Andrew Haldane. As the flowers began to bloom, the freshmen rose to fight 
        once more with their tormentors, the sophomores, in a frenzy of rotten 
        fruit and spraying water. The Orient proclaimed it &quot;one of the wildest, 
        fruit slingin' water dousin', panel breakin', clothes strippin' scraps 
        that has met the eyes of Bowdoin men in several years.&quot; With these 
        fights and other dreaded events-such as finals-the academic year ended 
        in June of 1938. The seniors graduated into an uncertain world, still 
        trying to disbelieve the obvious truth that another war was swiftly coming. 
        In China the Japanese armies entered, destroyed, and massacred thousands 
        of innocent civilians in what was known as the Rape of Nanking. In Europe 
        indecision amongst the allied powers aided rather than prevented Hitler's 
        armies from marching into Austria and uniting it with the growing German 
        nation. Be aware of international events, Sills warned graduates and returning 
        students alike: </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you think the question of international affairs has nothing to do with 
        you, go out someday and read the names of your older brothers inscribed 
        on the memorial flagstaff. A score of years ago or so, the undergraduates 
        of Bowdoin did not think what was happening in Europe was any concern 
        of theirs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The generation that Sills alluded to in his speech were on campus later 
        that year. Members of the Class of 1912, feeling that they should give 
        something back to their alma mater, returned to donate a 20-ton Westerly 
        White granite polar bear statue. Sculpted by the famed F. G. R. Roth of 
        New Jersey-the same man who created Columbia University's Lion and Princeton 
        University's Tigers-the 11 foot monument was a gift and as Henry A. Shorey, 
        a member of the Class of 1941 and Orient correspondent put it, &quot;The 
        doners hope, of course, that Bowdoin men past, present, and future will 
        take the Bear to their hearts and look upon it as a definite expression 
        to them of much that Bowdoin means.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The members of the Class of 1941 survived their first year virtually intact. 
        They were no longer the youngest members of the College community and 
        thus with their embarrassing and fond memories of their first years behind 
        them, they went on vacation, knowing that their best moments at Bowdoin 
        College were yet to come.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Elsewhere, men and tanks were moving and a depressed world crept ever 
        closer to full-scale war.</p>
