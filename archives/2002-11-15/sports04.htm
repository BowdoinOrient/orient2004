      <p align="left">Sixteen seconds remained on the clock, when-BANG!-Bowdoin 
        forward Marissa O'Neil '05 emphatically scored off the Williams goalkeeper. 
        However, it was not enough to defeat the NESCAC champion Williams Ephs, 
        who won 2-1 at Ryan Field last Sunday.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Second-seeded Williams entered the finals after narrowly beating Middlebury 
        2-1 in overtime on Saturday. By holding off the perseverant Polar Bears, 
        the Ephs defended their NESCAC championship title and gained automatic 
        entry into the NCAA Division III Championship. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, Williams did not enjoy an easy victory. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Offensively, I felt that we had many more chances [to] score than 
        Williams had,&quot; said senior co-captain Jackie Templeton. &quot;We 
        dominated the play for most of the game. Unfortunately, what ultimately 
        matters is who puts the ball in the goal, [and] Williams did just that.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 70 minutes of fervent field hockey, the Bears took 12 shots on goal, 
        11 of which Williams' goalkeeper Wendy Stone survived.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin goalie, stalwart Gillian McDonald '04, did not face Stone's constant 
        opposition, encountering only eight shots on goal and repelling six of 
        them. Williams pirated its two goals within five minutes of each other 
        in the last ten minutes of the first half. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Losing to Williams was really disappointing and frustrating,&quot; 
        said senior co-captain Sarah Laverty. &quot;We definitely have the ability 
        to beat them, but [we] just were not able to capitalize when it counted 
        yesterday.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the Bears more than capitalized in the NESCAC semifinals, mercilessly 
        trouncing Wesleyan 4-0. &quot;Wesleyan was a great game,&quot; said Laverty. 
        &quot;We all played really hard and it showed.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ten minutes into the first half, O'Neil slammed the ball past Wesleyan 
        goalkeeper Lindsay Wasserman, almost instantly following up her goal with 
        an assist to sophomore forward Colleen McDonald.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Senior forward Leah McClure gained control of the ball less than four 
        minutes after McDonald's goal, bringing the score to 3-0. McClure then 
        opened up the second half by assisting Templeton to the fourth and final 
        goal of the game.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I think I will remember our game against Wesleyan as our last,&quot; 
        said Templeton. &quot;Losing on our turf is just not something we do, 
        especially with the amazing team we had this season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Gillian McDonald captured her tenth shutout of the season against Wesleyan, 
        curbing all ten of the Cardinals' shots on goal. This season, McDonald 
        single-handedly made 94 saves in 16 games, ending up with a phenomenal 
        87 percent save percentage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin collectively scored 42 goals this season, led by McClure's 12, 
        and followed by O'Neil's 11. Colleen McDonald and Templeton tied with 
        each with four. First-year forward Christi Gannon scored twice, while 
        forward Allyson Craib '06 and Britney Carr '04 each scored once, rounding 
        out the scoring roster. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears closed the season with a 12-4 overall record, and a 7-2 NESCAC 
        record, which ties with Williams for the best team in the NESCAC this 
        season.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Looking back, it was a great season,&quot; said Laverty. &quot;This 
        year's team is an amazing group of girls that I will miss playing with.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin will graduate three valuable seniors this year in Laverty, Templeton, 
        and McClure. McClure was recognized by The National Field Hockey Coaches' 
        Association as one of the best field hockey players in the country with 
        an invitation to play in the Division III North/South Senior All-Star 
        Game on November 23 at Springfield College. </p>
