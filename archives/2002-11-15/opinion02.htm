        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> We Mainers know the phrase &quot;as Maine goes so goes 
        the nation.&quot; This wasn't true in the last election as the Republicans 
        won most major races nationally and the Democrats won all but one major 
        race in Maine. However, if the national Democratic Party learns from one 
        Maine candidate, Maine could once again reassert her favorite adage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The national Democratic Party should learn from Mike Michaud, the mill 
        worker from Millonocket who carried Maine's second district. Democrats 
        should study this race in addition to some recent history if they want 
        to take back the House, Senate or White House in 2004. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Michaud's combination of cultural conservatism and progressive economic 
        values guided him to victory. Entering the race he had a reputation as 
        being pro-life and pro-gun rights, yet he is also a staunch supporter 
        of labor unions, equal pay for equal work laws, and opposes social security 
        privatization. He defeated Kevin Raye, a moderate Republican who is pro-choice.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Michaud's victory is reminiscent of an era before the Democrats lost the 
        support of a type of voter known as &quot;Reagan Democrats.&quot; This 
        is a description of a voter who sympathizes with Democrats on a &quot;New 
        Deal&quot; economic agenda but who does not share a more modern Democratic 
        cultural liberalism. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; might tolerate a strike, but they will not 
        tolerate behaviors that they view as morally wrong: abortion rights, marijuana 
        legalization, and radically liberal interpretations of the separation 
        of church and state are anathema to these voters. &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; 
        also support high defense spending and consider themselves &quot;patriotic.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        This adamant belief in national defense helped explain Reagan's popularity 
        among this group of traditional economic Democrats. For example, Reagan 
        did well among union members in his 1984 reelection despite his 1981 decision 
        to fire striking Air Traffic Control workers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The 1980s were an opportune time for the Republicans to pull votes from 
        a traditional Democratic base. The late 1970s saw the disastrous presidency 
        of Jimmy Carter. Following the Iranian hostage crisis and the failed rescue 
        attempt, the United States became what Jeanne Kirkpatrick has called the 
        laughing stock of world foreign policy. Combining a strong foreign policy 
        with conservative economic and cultural values, Reagan beat Carter in 
        the 1980 election. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Today's Democrat party finds itself in a less advantageous position than 
        the Republicans did in 1980. The economy is not nearly as poor as it was 
        in the late 1970s. Thus far, President Bush's foreign policy has been 
        a success although Iraq remains the huge variable. Therefore, if the Democrats 
        hope to garner any success at the polls in 2004, they must pull votes 
        from people who view Republican economic beliefs as &quot;friendly to 
        the rich&quot; but who are repulsed by Democratic moral equivocation and 
        lackluster defense policy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Their only hope is to become a more culturally conservative party. Democrats 
        must encourage more candidates like Mike Michaud who are willing to at 
        least question party orthodoxy on abortion. This openness on abortion 
        partly explains Republican success in relatively liberal places. The Democrats 
        might want to try being more culturally conservative in relatively conservative 
        places, like the South and Midwest.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Democrats should loosen their rigidity on abortion and should unite around 
        their core issues in 2004. Increased education spending, and moderate 
        increases in prescription drug coverage should accompany aggressive stances 
        in favor of a strong military and at least a tepid endorsement of &quot;family 
        values.&quot; A candidate such as Joe Lieberman who is a man of profound 
        faith, committed to the military, is not scared to challenge immorality 
        in Hollywood would be an ideal candidate. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Democrats must move closer to the Republicans on some key social issues 
        to win, such as abortion and the military. As this election shows, the 
        country is becoming more conservative. The Democrats must respond accordingly 
        if there is to be any validation of Maine's vain axiom. </p>
