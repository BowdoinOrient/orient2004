      <p align="left">Can you handle it? Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey is back in 
        action, so I'll ask again, can you handle it? This year's national polls 
        have ranked the Bears third, one place above their pre-season ranking 
        last year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Coming off a Final Four appearance in the NCAA tournament, and losing 
        only one member to graduation, this squad is ready to pick up where they 
        left off. However, Coach Michelle Amidon cautioned, &quot;Manhattenville 
        [ranked second nationally] didn't graduate any strength, Elmira [ranked 
        first nationally] didn't have any seniors, and Middlebury has a great 
        first year class&#133;. There are a lot of teams out there with increased 
        pressure to succeed because of last year's performance.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        That said, Bowdoin is proud to be reigning NESCAC Champions, sporting 
        a record of 23-5-1 from last season. Speaking about the increased pressure, 
        senior Captain Emily McKissock said, &quot;We know that we have a great 
        team from last season, and our first years are showing great potential. 
        The pressure that may come from last year's success only adds to our anticipation 
        for a great season this year.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Co-Capt. Sadie Wieschhoff '04 added, &quot;This is a new season, and now 
        being known as a better program, we are going to be one of the teams to 
        beat. We cannot take this lightly.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This emphasis on hard work is vital to the women's ice hockey program. 
        Coach Amidon said the keys to success are to &quot;Act, practice, and 
        play like a national contending program. We have the depth, the skill, 
        and the knowledge. All we need to do is put all three of those together.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Wieschhoff said, &quot;We have the opportunity to have another amazing 
        season; it will just take a lot of hard work and determination. I know 
        the team is up to the challenge.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The only questions that loom over the season are how quickly this team 
        can gel, given that three juniors are currently abroad until December 
        30 (Kirsten Larsen, Jess Burke, and Jenn Pelkey), and five fall athletes 
        have just hit the ice. </p>
      <p align="left">
        McKissock confidently emphasized, &quot;With the late start of the fall 
        athletes and having a few players abroad, we've just been working that 
        much harder with the players we do have during these first weeks of the 
        season.&quot; Wieschhoff added, &quot;We are very excited to have our 
        fall athletes back. They are a significant chunk of the team.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey has jumped to new levels over the past few 
        years, and the end does not seem to be in sight. Dedication, experience, 
        and talent are just a few of the qualities embodied by one of the most 
        successful teams on this campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We know what we have to do to get to the Final Four; now we have 
        to prepare to go all the way,&quot; said McKissock. Coach Amidon added, 
        &quot;Not everyone can be at the top. Only time will tell.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The last ingredient in the recipe of true success is fan support. Wieschhoff 
        noted, &quot;Of course our fans will be very important.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Last year's defeat to NESCAC rival Middlebury in the first round of the 
        NCAA tournament was undoubtedly the athletic event of the year. Quality 
        play and fast-paced action are all guaranteed at every outing by this 
        club. </p>
      <p align="left">
        No doubt, these girls know how to entertain a crowd. So anticipate competition, 
        anticipate controversy, and anticipate greatness&#133;buckle your seatbelts 
        because this season promises to be a long, wild ride.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally, a note from Spain, &quot;Big wuvies and huggies to all&#133;TEAR 
        SHIT UP NESCAC CHAMPS!&quot; Ditto.</p>
