      <p align="left">The band of a happy few from Bowdoin College lined up with 
        the other students and professors that were eagerly awaiting entrance 
        into Sanders Theater at Harvard. Slowly, they filed into the rows of benches 
        and took their seats-making sure that they had clear views of the stage. 
        The trip had been long and the tickets had been acquired with no small 
        effort by the Bowdoin professors who had organized the venture-but the 
        results were sure to be unforgettable. There, before the eager faces of 
        some 25 students-from both Professor Jane E. Knox-Voina's Russian classes 
        and Professor Marcia Weigle's Post- Communist Russian Politics class- 
        a Russian legend of the political and historical realm, Mikhail Gorbachev, 
        was to make an appearance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The tension built as the crowd was made to wait and a single cup of tea, 
        seated neatly on its saucer, was ferried out onto the stage and placed 
        by the side of the podium. The students of the Post-Communist Politics 
        class glanced at each other. They remembered the video clip seen in class 
        in which Gorbachev had publicly resigned from the presidency of Russia, 
        all the while glancing sadly at a solitary cup of tea that sat on his 
        desk. Again, the stage was still and the crowd grew ever more restless.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Suddenly, footsteps were heard ascending the stairs at the back of the 
        platform. A hush fell over the crowd as Gorbachev made his entrance, accompanied 
        by his interpreter and President Lawrence H. Sumners of Harvard University. 
        The audience erupted into raucous cheers and thunderous clapping. Gorbachev 
        looked out at the sea of faces as he sat down, his chin jutted out in 
        approval. As the cheers continued he stood up to acknowledge them and 
        wave his hand, causing another vigorous round of applause. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Before the audience stood the man that had been a child of the 20th Party 
        Congress, a man who had instigated glasnost and perestroika, a president 
        who had survived a coup in 1991, and, finally, had stepped down from his 
        position later that same year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Glasnost had meant the introduction of public openness into a society 
        that had formerly been severely hemmed in by a more oppressive Communist 
        Party system. Gorbachev's program of perestroika entailed an increase 
        in production in a country that was lagging dangerously behind the rest 
        of the world in terms of industry. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It was the latter of these two issues that Gorbachev had come to address 
        in his speech entitled &quot;Looking Back on Perestroika.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In Weigle's class, students had learned of the atrocities that perestroika 
        had caused-the ridiculous inefficiencies of frenzied production and the 
        heavy toll that these had taken on the Russian environment. Nevertheless, 
        in the 45-minute speech that followed, Gorbachev defended his policy of 
        perestroika to the point of claiming that it was an absolutely necessary 
        step in the development of Russia. &quot;A lot of things could have been 
        done differently after perestroika. A lot of things could have been done 
        different during perestroika, but there are not 'ifs' in history,&quot; 
        said Gorbachev.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;People are asking today whether perestroika has a future or is it 
        in the past. I believe perestroika is still in the future,&quot; Gorbachev 
        said. &quot;When I stepped down, people said the era of Gorbachev is over. 
        I replied then and I still reply, 'The era of Gorbachev is just beginning.'&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the speech was primarily about perestroika, Gorbachev managed 
        to slip in his opinion about world affairs in general, all with the charismatic 
        charm of a seasoned politician. For example, Gorbachev commented that 
        if he were still president there would be have been no war in Chechnya-failing 
        to mention that while he was president &quot;he sent troops into the Baltic 
        states,&quot; according to Arwyn Carroll '05.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Furthermore, Gorbachev made it clear that he felt that the United States 
        should not engage in unilateral action against Iraq. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Another theme that ran throughout was his opposition against Yeltsin's 
        policies, particularly the &quot;shock therapy&quot; that was initiated 
        during Yeltsin's presidency. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although his speech frustrated many students in that he skirted many of 
        the issues and offered little explanation or comment on some of the disastrous 
        results of perestroika, none could deny that seeing him in person was 
        a mind-blowing experience.</p>
