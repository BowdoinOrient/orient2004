      <p align="left"> For some it was the firefighters with their shiny red engines; 
        for others, the astronauts and their ability to walk on the moon. Michael 
        Jordan always figured prominently and Michelle Kwan received at least 
        a few votes in the heated debates on the playground of my middle school 
        over our dreams for the future. I remember sitting on the swing, and with 
        each pump becoming more and more sure of what I wanted to be. Without 
        any hesitation, in sixth grade I was positive that I would become a veterinarian. 
        At that time, I believed nothing could be as wonderful as helping sick 
        animals for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ironically, while deciding which classes to take this upcoming semester, 
        I am avoiding science courses at all costs. At some point in the past 
        six years, reality reared its ugly head and I realized my aversion to 
        biology, and, consequently, the unlikelihood of my future as a veterinarian. 
        Nonetheless, the importance of our childhood dreams isn't their veracity, 
        I'll bet that most of us have updated modified and/or abandoned most of 
        those pilot and presidential inklings, but the fact that they allowed 
        us to believe that anything was possible, to ignore the financial limitations 
        and other realities we become aware of with age.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While volunteering at the Portland Housing Authority this past week, I 
        noticed that students made a board of their dreams for the future. Strikingly, 
        the display lacked the frivolity of the innocent view of life my adolescent 
        peers and I shared. Most of the students are first-generation immigrants 
        from Africa whose pasts include the horrors of countries ravaged by war 
        or the incomparable grief of leaving a mother behind in a refugee camp. 
        Hence, the sports hero was replaced in one fourth grader's dream by the 
        desire &quot;to be a doctor or to make houses so that people can sleep 
        there. I will go all over the world and if someone is hurt I will fix 
        their heart. I will go back to Africa and help people.&quot; Ana, a seventh 
        grader, wrote of her dream to &quot;help some people who don't have food 
        or money and make them happy&quot; and to be a &quot;judge&quot; or &quot;doctor.&quot; 
        Reading these dreams, I was struck by how fortunate I am that my dreams 
        could have no reality basis; for the first time, I understood that wishing 
        to be an Olympic skier was a privilege rather than an inherent part of 
        childhood.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Significantly, in the words of ninth grader Abraham, the means of achieving 
        any and all of these dreams lie in the completion of education. &quot;I 
        want to be a man of government to help my homeland Africa. I want to feed 
        the needy and stop the war before the land is destroyed. Once it's destroyed 
        there's no place for our kids to look back and say, 'That is my homeland.' 
        To reach this goal I will stay in school and graduate from college.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        This upcoming week, Monday through Thursday (November 18 through 21) from 
        12:00 p.m. to 4 p.m., we at Bowdoin will have the chance to help make 
        these dreams of Ana, Abraham, and countless others a reality. The Portland 
        Housing Authority will be asking people to donate pens, notebooks, spare 
        change, and any other spare school supplies at a table in Smith Union. 
        At Bowdoin, we have ample opportunities to discuss issues, but fewer occasions 
        to take action and to make a difference in other peoples' lives. Therefore, 
        this upcoming week drop off a pack of pencils or some paper in Smith Union 
        not only for Ana, Abraham, and the other kids in Portland, but for the 
        police officer, movie star, or veterinarian that still lives somewhere 
        inside of you.</p>
