      <p align="left">To the Editors: </p>
      <p align="left">Acadia Senese's opinion piece in the last Orient questioned 
        whether the use of posters by Sustainable Bowdoin is in keeping with the 
        stated mission of that organization. I hope I can help to clear up any 
        lingering confusion surrounding Sustainable Bowdoin's &quot;poster policy.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        We certainly believe that an organization devoted to sustainability must 
        be conscious of the environmental impacts of its practices. Our commitment 
        to environmentally responsible publicity, for example, has taken on several 
        forms in the past year. Whenever possible, we try to reduce paper announcements 
        by using alternative means of communication, including faculty/staff/student 
        digests, the Bowdoin Sun, the Sustainable Bowdoin web page (check it out 
        at www.bowdoin.edu/sustainablebowdoin), and radio ads on WBOR. On occasion, 
        we do find that displaying a very limited number of posters is the most 
        efficient means of conveying important information to the Bowdoin community. 
        When making these posters, we use recycled paper, &quot;ABU&quot; (already 
        been used) paper, or both! We further restrict postings to situations 
        where we feel the potential positive impacts of the posters merit the 
        paper use.</p>
      <p align="left">
        You'll be pleased to hear that Sustainable Bowdoin has been active in 
        several additional initiatives to reduce paper consumption on-campus, 
        from encouraging double-sided printing in the computer labs to supporting 
        the Office of Student Records' recent transition to an online course booklet.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I hope this helps to demystify some of our motives. As always, please 
        get in touch with any additional feedback or questions you have-it's always 
        nice to discover that members of the campus community are alert to ways 
        in which we can further increase our level of sustainability.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Students protest paper cup policy</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>When in the course of human events, the small tyrannies of many repeated 
        injustices amount to an unreasonable burden, the voice of the people must 
        be heard to shout out in protest. Although the reach of Sustainable Bowdoin 
        has yet to expand enough to be quantified as tyrannical, or unjust, it 
        lays the foundation for such a description. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Its current campaign to rid the campus of the evils of paper cups is as 
        patronizing as it is self-defeating. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that 
        reasonable individuals accept certain measures of waste-reduction, as 
        recycling, energy conservation et cetera. However, we have witnessed an 
        unprecedented backlash at this current paper-cup initiative, and expect 
        that it is an imprudent use of the political capital of such an organization 
        as Sustainable Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The use of &quot;political capital&quot; in the previous sentence may 
        be a misnomer, as it suggests that this came about through some presumably 
        legitimate political process. Rather, it was a decision made by Sustainable 
        Bowdoin's Dear Leader, Keisha Payson, an employee of the College. Had 
        this been a completely student led initiative, complete with student feedback, 
        perhaps it would have been acceptable. However, as it comes from the dictatorial 
        authority of a woman whose salary is dependent upon her saving money for 
        the school, it's clear that the desires of the student body are not a 
        consideration. This is of course, a repeated trend at Bowdoin, as few 
        recent initiatives here have been supported by the students, if they were 
        asked for input at all.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We are also not persuaded by the economics of the issue. The $4,000 and 
        change that could be saved by outlawing paper cups is a paltry sum in 
        comparison to the costs of running a school. Divided up over a student 
        body of 1,600, we save $2.50 a piece. Please credit our tuition accordingly.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Having done away with warm water in the washers, and therefore clean clothes, 
        this is but another step in a campaign that will no doubt result in the 
        institution of the purely obnoxious low-flow shower heads and toilets. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The success of environmentally friendly policies is dependent upon the 
        support of students. We, the undersigned do not support this policy, and 
        we are but a few voices representing the many we have heard voice their 
        opposition. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sustainable Bowdoin, it would do you well not to fritter away the potential 
        influence of your organization on such an unjust and paltry cause. </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Americans have a responsibility to vote</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Patrick Rockefeller, in a recent opinion piece, decried what he perceives 
        to be the trend on the part of media entities and political advocacy groups 
        (most likely left-leaning as I'm sure he would otherwise take no issue) 
        toward encouraging great masses of unwashed young Americans to vote. He 
        holds that those with an apathetic attitude toward elections and the political 
        process in general should stay at home on election day, that the apathetic 
        seem to have a duty to the more politically astute not to vote. Logically, 
        I have yet to decipher any particular merit to the basic principle of 
        his argument. It begs the following question: if a young voter is urged 
        to vote and does so, is that voter manifesting an apathetic attitude? 
        The idea of a totally apathetic voter would seem to rank shoulder-to-shoulder 
        with a proposal for a submarine equipped with screen doors on the playing 
        field of oxymorons--by voting, a person has ceased, at least to an extent, 
        to be apathetic. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The real issue here is how these young voters might cast their ballots. 
        As has been the case since the Vietnam era, nothing seems to terrify conservatives 
        more than college-aged voters with potentially liberal dispositions. Obviously, 
        conservatives have no problems with get-out-the-vote campaigns; as practiced 
        by groups such as the Christian Coalition, these were, to a considerable 
        degree, to thank for the Republican takeover of the House in 1994. Should 
        voters with deeply conservative, Christian views have been told to stay 
        home in November if they hadn't decided to vote on their own? I would 
        be very interested to hear Mr. Rockefeller's opinion on the subject.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As to the right to vote and its accompanying responsibilities, I would 
        remind Mr. Rockefeller that both he and I filled out our draft cards when 
        we turned 18. What more awesome responsibility is there than serving one's 
        country in war time? This is one of the main reasons that the voting age 
        was lowered from 21 to 18 in the first place. Regardless of draft status, 
        all Americans are bound to act in accordance with the laws of their states 
        of citizenship and the United States. Is this not a responsibility weighty 
        enough to balance with the right to vote? I choose to exercise my right 
        to vote, I feel I have earned it, and I am terribly sorry if my personal 
        decisions at the polls might not mirror Mr. Rockefeller's own.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
