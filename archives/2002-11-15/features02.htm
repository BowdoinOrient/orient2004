        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL<br>
        ORIENT STAFF AT LARGE</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">London is a crazy place to be right now. Between the protests, 
        strikes, random downpours, and mayhem, there is little room left for serenity. 
        I still try to find a little bit of it each day from the comfort of my 
        apartment (even though the sirens usually make this process difficult).</p>
      <p align="left">
        There weren't any sirens yesterday, though. London's entire firefighting 
        force has been on strike this week, beginning Wednesday afternoon and 
        (hopefully) ending tonight. The problem, of course, lies in wages. The 
        firefighters have demanded a 40 percent pay increase-a hike that English 
        prime minister Tony Blair said &quot;no government on earth&quot; could 
        provide. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The outlook is not very optimistic. The firefighters are picketing all 
        over the city until 6:00 p.m. tonight, and if a pay raise fails to materialize, 
        they are threatening a series of eight-day strikes between now and Christmas 
        Eve.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I'll give them credit, because they certainly chose an effective method 
        of proving their importance. It's easy to take a public service like firefighting 
        for granted until they ALL quit for a couple of days, leaving you to wonder 
        what you'd do if one of your university buildings went up in flames (or, 
        more likely in my case, if one of your cooking experiments was less than 
        successful). Seriously, who the heck will respond if something's on fire? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The government's temporary answer to that question: the Green Goddesses. 
        They're deploying soldiers in these enormous, ancient military vehicles 
        to the scenes of any outbreaks while the first strike runs its course. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        At first, you think, great! Good plan, guys! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Then you remember that soldiers are not necessarily fully trained firefighters, 
        and you're not as excited. Then you learn that these Goddesses top out 
        at 35 miles per hour, and you get less enthused about your odds of survival. 
        One of my friends suggested carrying a fire extinguisher around everywhere, 
        but I have yet to see anyone acting on his advice.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the strike has obvious repercussions (fear for one's life in the 
        event of fire, to name one), there are other effects as well. London Underground 
        workers had finally stopped their striking only weeks ago, settling with 
        the government for higher pay. They are now halting subway services to 
        roughly 20 stations because they have no fire cover in the event of an 
        emergency. There is talk of the entire Underground system being shut down 
        if the firefighters continue striking. More than a million people travel 
        via &quot;Tube&quot; every day, and the prospect of a shutdown has all 
        the London tabloids running enormous headlines about city travel &quot;GRINDING 
        TO A HALT!&quot; and becoming &quot;COMPLETELY CHAOTIC!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The striking fun doesn't end there. A selected group of London university 
        staff-professors, janitors, security guards, and the like-lined the sidewalks 
        yesterday, demanding a higher standard-of-living bonus (it hasn't been 
        adjusted in ten years, so I have to side with them on this one). The disruption 
        of the education system has affected several of my roommates, who are 
        all crowing about cancelled classes-leaving me to wish that my professors 
        were more strike-oriented.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Believe it or not, there's more. Not wanting to be left out, workers are 
        planning a mess of one-day strikes at all seven regional airports, which 
        will completely shut down air traffic into England on those days. Luckily, 
        none of those seven dates coincide with my return to the States for winter 
        vacation (and I'm crossing my fingers that they don't reschedule).</p>
      <p align="left">
        The timing for all this couldn't be worse. The ports have been under red 
        alert all week after receiving word that terrorists were trying to get 
        an explosive-laden truck into England via boat from France. If a terrorist 
        attack does occur, the quickness of emergency response will be hindered 
        by the fact that the fire stations are empty as drums, without a single 
        firefighter ready to take the call. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Warnings have been issued to Americans abroad-a relatively common occurrence 
        since last September. This time, the cautionary announcements have us 
        all a bit more on edge. </p>
      <p align="left">
        We recently learned that the goal of the Bali attacks was the highest 
        possible number of American deaths, and we've been told a thousand times 
        that we shouldn't act visibly &quot;American&quot; out and about in the 
        city, as it puts us at greater risk. And London's disrupted infrastructure 
        may make us more vulnerable than ever.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I don't mean to sound pessimistic, nor am I implying that I'm hiding out 
        in my apartment with a fire extinguisher in one hand and a bucket of water 
        in the other. Life, as always, goes on. Even amidst the downpours, the 
        warnings, and the apprehension, life goes on.</p>
