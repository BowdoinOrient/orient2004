        and Pierce go to Bowdoin</font><br>

      <p align="left">It is amazing to see the number of remarkable people that 
        pass through the gates of Bowdoin. Indeed, in the years from 1823 to 1825, 
        five individuals who would, in the course of their lives, play a significant 
        role in matters of politics, education, and literature would graduate 
        from the College. But, there was barely a college then. Presided over 
        by President William Allen, the three buildings that were in use were 
        Massachusetts Halls, Winthrop Hall, Maine Hall, and the Chapel. Given 
        the fact that the class of 1824 had a mere nineteen students, the facilities 
        were probably quite adequate.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There were but six faculty members and the tuition for one 
        semester was less than seven dollars. The small size of the College certainly 
        did not hamper the quality of the education that the students received. 
        In fact, the Bowdoin of those days was probably quite a nice spot to sit, 
        read, write poetry, and dream. Pine trees, not people, ruled the state 
        of Maine. The Androscoggin, flowing as it flows today, snaked past the 
        small college town and lent its presence to the scholars who came to Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">William Pitt Fessenden was born to Samuel Fessenden and 
        Ruth Greene on October 16, 1806. Young Fessenden was named after William 
        Pitt, the British politician. His father never married his mother, and 
        the young boy would never get to know the woman who bore him, for he was 
        given to Samuel's mother to be raised. These uneventful years for young 
        William went by rather swiftly. His father soon married another lady, 
        who bore him many children. In addition, the senior Fessenden was also 
        advancing in the military. During the War of 1812, he was bestowed the 
        rank of major general in the Maine militia.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1818, Pitt (as he was referred to by his friends) tried 
        his hand at entering Bowdoin College. In those days, the requirements 
        for getting into the College were extensive and included knowledge of 
        arithmetic, geometry, Latin and Greek. Ill prepared at his first attempt, 
        young Pitt Fessenden was sent home. Reading and work occupied most of 
        the young boy's time and his education at North Yarmouth Academy (later 
        in the century to be attended by Civil War great Oliver Howard of the 
        Bowdoin class of 1850) did not go to waste. A year later, at the mere 
        age of thirteen, William Pitt Fessenden began his Bowdoin career in the 
        class of 1823.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden jumped right into the Bowdoin experience (whatever 
        it might have been in the early decades of the nineteenth century) and 
        was active in public speaking as well as earning decent grades in class. 
        Fessenden's quick mind enabled him to complete work quickly and then spend 
        the rest of the time on sports or other activities. As far as friends 
        were concerned, Fessenden was a likable chap who liked his friends and 
        hated his enemies. However, during his junior year, Fessenden found himself 
        with poor standing in his class and thus resolved to work harder.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Entering the class behind William Pitt Fessenden was a young 
        lad from New Hampshire. His name was Franklin Pierce and, as the son of 
        the Revolutionary War general Benjamin Pierce, he had a big name to live 
        up to. Young Pierce, however, did not seem to care. He was a troublemaker, 
        known for his fighting and damaging of property. Indeed, the strict rules 
        of Bowdoin did not prevent the future president from trying his very best 
        to get as close to being expelled as possible. The young Pierce even became 
        entangled in a mini-sized mutiny over the issue of military drill.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin president Allen certainly was not a fan of young 
        Mr. Pierce. In the classroom he was no better. Once, coming into Alpheus 
        Packard's math class, he copied the homework assignment from his classmate 
        Calvin Stowe's slate. When Professor Packard asked Pierce to present the 
        problem he did so. When the professor further asked the troublemaker where 
        he had acquired this homework, he answered with an honest and humored 
        face, &quot;Why, from Stowe's slate, of course!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Later in his life, Calvin Stowe would marry Harriet Beecher 
        and bring her to Brunswick, Maine where, in the First Parish Church, she 
        would have a vision and thereafter write one of the most amazing books 
        in American history, Uncle Tom's Cabin. Calvin Stowe, aside from supporting 
        his wife's endeavors, would also lead a crusade for free public education 
        in America.<br>

      <p align="left">In Franklin Pierce's junior year at Bowdoin, he stood last 
        in his class. Like William Pitt Fessenden in the class ahead of him, he 
        would gear up for his last year in college. With a rigorous study schedule 
        beginning at four a.m., the future president fought his way up till he 
        stood fifth in his class. His friendship with Nathaniel Hawthorne '25 
        would be lifelong, Pierce having begun it at Bowdoin. Hawthorne and his 
        classmate Longfellow would leave Bowdoin and make names for themselves 
        as literary geniuses. That's a lot more that can be said for Franklin 
        Pierce's future, but that part is yet to come.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">William Pitt Fessenden had some trouble with the College 
        in his final year. The faculty accused him of going to a tavern without 
        permission. The faculty members proclaimed that for his &quot;disrespectful 
        conduct&quot; and &quot;profane swearing&quot;, he should be punished 
        by not being allowed to graduate. With the help of his father, however, 
        Pitt was later given his Bowdoin degree.<br>
        Franklin Pierce had no trouble graduating the following year, for he was 
        number five in his class of fifteen remaining students. That year's ceremony 
        was supposed to be spectacular- the Marquis de Lafayette had been invited 
        to accept an honorary degree from Bowdoin. However, neither the Frenchman, 
        nor General Pierce, young Franklin's father, were able to attend. As disappointing 
        as that may have been, Pierce was on his way out from college. That was 
        really all that mattered. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thus, two political figures were headed out into the world 
        from the gates of Bowdoin. One was William Pitt Fessenden, soon to grace 
        the steps of the United States Senate. The other was Franklin Pierce, 
        whose path would lead him to the Senate as well as to a four year stay 
        at the White House.<br>
