      <p>While many teams are busy rebuilding their core this year, the women's 
        rugby team has simply reloaded its roster with countless experienced veterans 
        and an energetic group of rookies. Having only lost four seniors last 
        year and over sixty players strong, the team is well equipped for the 
        coming season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Under the strong leadership of senior captains Katherine Buckspan and 
        Sarah Jenness and coaches MaryBeth and Bob Matthews, the team is already 
        shaping up with strengthened fundamentals and improved conditioning. Thanks 
        to some extensive recruitment efforts, a considerable number of first 
        years, as well as several new upperclassmen, joined the team this year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers have high expectations for this fall. They finished last 
        season with a 5-1 record, good enough for third place in Division II, 
        just behind Wellesley and Wesleyan. This will the rugby team's second 
        year in Division II, after having played for four years in Division I. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Already, the rivalry between Bowdoin and Wellesley, who dealt the Polar 
        Bears their only loss of the season, is clear. This year, Wellesley will 
        visit Bowdoin on October 27, and promises to bring the matchup of the 
        season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Disappointed with field conditions last year, the ruggers are looking 
        for revenge. &quot;Remember that little field with the tree in the try 
        zone? Well, none of that this year,&quot; Buckspan said. &quot;They're 
        coming up to play on a real pitch, and I predict we destroy them by physically 
        dominating the game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We'll use the speed of our wings and fullback and our excellent 
        conditioning to wear them down and then dominate offensively,&quot; she 
        continued.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers have plenty to defend before Wellesley, starting with tomorrow's 
        round-robin tournament against Bates and Colby at Farley. In order to 
        prepare for this tournament and the upcoming season, the ruggers have 
        been drilling basic components every day in practice. <br>
      </p>
      <p>They also have been incorporating a lot of new material learned from 
        last year's spring break tour to Scotland and England. Ruggers gained 
        experience playing advanced European teams and working with some well-known 
        coaches. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coach MaryBeth Matthews was excited about this learning opportunity. 
        &quot;Great experience [was] gained during the spring tour to Scotland 
        and England,&quot; she said. &quot;[It] was an amazing experience for 
        all who could take part...strengthening our skills and our friendships 
        and solidifying the meaning of TEAM.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Friendship and team, as most players will tell you, are the essences 
        of rugby. First years and seniors alike view this club as a network of 
        friends. &quot;The team is like one huge family; you can't go anywhere 
        without running into someone,&quot; first year Carolyn Dion said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I instantly made 50 new friends when I joined the team,&quot; Amelia 
        Rutter '05 added.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rookie junior Andrea Weeks was in agreement as well. &quot;I promised 
        a friend I'd try rugby for a week, and I'm definitely a part of the team 
        now!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the forward pack, returning players Buckspan, Carolyn Westra '03, 
        Camilla Yamada '03, and Liz Swedock '03 lead with experience. In the backfield, 
        Jenness, Ellie Doig '03, Joanie Taylor '03, Lindsay Pettingill '02, and 
        Julie Thompson '03 will help lead the attack and defense.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I'm expecting a lot of good things from this season,&quot; Jenness 
        said. &quot;Not only do we have a tremendous amount of returning talent, 
        but the skill and dedication that the rookies have brought to the field 
        is really promising.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team's first battle is tomorrow, starting at noon against Bates and 
        Colby. With four home games set for this season, the ruggers can't wait 
        to show Bowdoin what they're made of.<br>
