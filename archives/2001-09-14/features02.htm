        Staff Writer</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Dear Dr. Jeff</b>: I am a little confused about the health 
        insurance offered by Bowdoin, and I was wondering if you could clarify 
        some issues for me. Can I cancel this unrequested policy? I already have 
        health insurance and to be paying for another policy seems a little absurd. 
        The $300 per year fee seems, on first glance, a little suspicious. Perhaps 
        the health center could take some initiative to educate students about 
        the cost of health care and the student insurance policy, as well as health 
        insurance in general. O.S.</p>
      <p><b>Dear O.S</b>.: You are not alone in wondering about the student health 
        insurance plan. In spite of a number of attempts to clarify students' 
        (and parents') concerns and questions, doubts still clearly persist. Let 
        me try to clarify a few key points.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The $300 Student Health fee pays for a broad array of health care services. 
        It buys unlimited access to the Health Center, and all of the required 
        vaccines, in-house x-rays and lab tests, over-the-counter and prescription 
        medications, bandages, splints, and primary and acute care services we 
        offer there. These are all free of charge and in unlimited supply. As 
        I hope you have heard, we are very pleased to be able to offer students 
        free Pap tests, free STD testing, and free formulary prescription medications 
        this year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Health fee pays for visits to the Counseling Center as well, at no 
        extra charge. This includes an unlimited number of sessions with the Counseling 
        Staff and with Dr. Stenzel, our consulting psychiatrist.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Health fee pays for a $200 prescription benefit each school year.<br>
        And last, but by no means least, the Health fee buys you a remarkably 
        inexpensive health insurance policy, which pays for visits to specialists, 
        Emergency Room care, hospitalizations, surgery, outside lab tests, etc.<br>
        The package of services purchased with your Health fee is broad and comprehensive. 
        It also represents a truly incredible bargain. Many people pay per month 
        what your plan costs per year, and even then, for coverage and services 
        that are far more limited. Almost no health insurance plan allows unlimited 
        access to medical services, or access to these services without additional 
        co-payments. No health insurance plan pays for unlimited mental health 
        services. <br>
      </p>
      <p>You could easily spend the equivalent of your whole year's Student Health 
        fee in one month (or less) seeing a therapist in the community. Or, on 
        the other hand, you could &quot;recoup&quot; two-thirds of your Health 
        fee in paid prescription benefits each year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This student health package can only be offered to all students at this 
        price, if all students purchase it. Utilization and cost of services must 
        be spread over the whole group. That's how insurance works. The fewer 
        the students enrolled in a program, the higher its price (and, likely, 
        the fewer its benefits.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>There's one other important benefit to consider. The services and coverage 
        purchased by your Health fee are yours. You don't need to obtain pre-approval 
        from an insurance company, a doctor's office, or your parents. No one 
        reviews the prescriptions you've filled, or the lab tests you've had, 
        or the treatments you've received. Your Health fee pays for your health 
        care: comprehensively, inexpensively, and confidentially. </p>
