      <p>The Bowdoin Women's Field Hockey Team displayed its strength and versatility 
        with wins in both games of a double header this weekend. A dominating 
        4-0 shutout over the M.I.T. Engineers kicked off the season, and was followed 
        by a 2-1 defeat of Wheaton.<br>

      <p>Christening Howard F. Ryan '28 Field last Saturday with the surface's 
        first game, the Lady Polar Bears put forth their best effort to come out 
        on top.<br>
        &quot;It almost felt unreal that we were actually playing after having 
        had so many pre-season practices,&quot; sophomore Shoshana Kuriloff said. 
        &quot;We were well-prepared, excited, and ready.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Eighteen minutes into the first half, she pounded the ball into M.I.T's 
        net off an assist from captain Alison Scaduto '02, earning the bragging 
        right of the newly dedicated Astroturf field's first scored goal.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With only three minutes remaining in the half, sophomore Amanda Burrage 
        boosted the lead to 2-0 off a pass from Beth Sherman '02. <br>
      </p>
      <p>During halftime, the Bowdoin women reviewed what they had focused on 
        during preseason and &quot;talked about not letting them [MIT] back in 
        the game and expanding our lead,&quot; Kuriloff said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The second half was simlarly strong for the women. The Bears' forward 
        line put in two unassisted goals, with Leah McClure '03 and first-year 
        Colleen McDonald leading the Bears to the final 4-0 score over the Engineers. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Employed in net were sophomores Gillian McDonald and Kristin Pollock, 
        who combined for four saves and held MIT scoreless. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Bowdoin women traveled to Norton, Massachusetts for a 
        non-conference game. The Bears were triumphant again, defeating Wheaton 
        College with a score of 2-1.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Forwards Kuriloff and Marissa O'Neil '05 used teamwork twice to score 
        in the first half. Both tallied one goal and one assist each in the matchup.<br>
        It wasn't as easy as it looked, Kuriloff reflected. &quot;We struggled 
        in the opening minutes to adjust to the grass, and Wheaton was in our 
        defensive end almost the entire time,&quot; she said. &quot;But then we 
        fired it up and scored two goals in two minutes.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Captain Heather Nicholson '02 also commented on the change of fields 
        and its effect on the team's game. &quot;Most of us hadn't played on the 
        grass since last season, but the skills came right back,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the second half, Wheaton managed to sneak one by goaltender McDonald, 
        bringing the score to 2-1. The game concluded at the same total, and McDonald 
        finished with eight saves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Lady Polar Bears have another double-header set for this weekend, 
        and both games will be played at home. On Saturday, the women will match 
        up with Williams, the only team to conquer Bowdoin in the regular 2000 
        season. Sunday will bring yet another tough opponent, as Wesleyan was 
        the ECAC championship team last year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;They are two skilled, tough teams, but we are definitely ready 
        for the challenge and confident in our own abilities,&quot; Nicholson 
        said. &quot;We are going to take our game to them right from the first 
        minute!&quot;<br>
