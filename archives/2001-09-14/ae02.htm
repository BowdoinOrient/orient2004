      <p>Okay- this movie is nuts. Absolutely nuts. The first part is so good, 
        but the second so bad, that I think the writer must've died halfway through 
        the script and been replaced by Carrot Top (sadly, Victor Salva, who directed 
        and starred in this film, also wrote the whole movie). In light of this, 
        I've decided that this film should be reviewed not as one, but two separate 
        films- Jeepers Creepers Part 1, the terror/suspense thriller, and Jeepers 
        Creepers Part 2, a parody of a bad &quot;X-Files&quot; episode. Let the 
        horror begin. <br>

      <p>Trish (Gina Philipps) and her brother Derry (Justin Long) are driving 
        down a long, deserted highway in the middle of nowhere and, on a whim, 
        they decide to explore a suspicious church basement. As a result, they 
        find a horrific creature who begins to hunt them down in a chilling game 
        of cat and mouse. This part has some excellent camera angles, good development 
        of the story, and very natural acting. <br>
      </p>
      <p>That's the first &quot;movie.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The second is much more fun to review.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In it, among other insignificantly predictable events, the two main characters 
        meet up with a psychic who tells them the very cheesy mythology of the 
        monster (every 23rd spring for 23 days blah blah blah). This also conveniently 
        serves to foreshadow the result of the chase. I can just see Salva writing 
        the script late one night thinking, &quot;Hmmm&#133;. This story needs 
        a creative, enticing way to explain the legend of the monster&#133; and 
        it needs some clever nail-biting suspense&#133; but I can't be creative 
        or enticing, let alone clever, so, I'll just write in a crazy psychic 
        to come out of nowhere!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Good to know he got more sleep. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Disappointingly, in development of the story, the movie broke a very 
        important slasher movie rule: &quot;You Tell 'Em, You Kill 'Em.&quot; 
        Think about it. Only the helpless group of hunted victims truly knows 
        about the monster and they are either cut off from communication with 
        everyone, or no one ever believes them. And when some expendable, promising 
        bystander finally does believe their story, the audience knows that he's 
        the next one to die. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Now, there are some exceptions--a well thought-out horror movie can bypass 
        this rule, get many people entwined in the plot, and still make it work. 
        This is not one of those movies. Jeepers Creepers Part 2 tries and fails 
        miserably. The outsiders involved don't all die, and they are much stupider 
        than the kids. <br>
        All in all, I have to say that Jeepers Creepers was oh-so-much fun to 
        watch. It was so funny to follow its descent into the abyss of corniness 
        that it ended up being good wholesome popcorn-entertainment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example of what you can expect: a mass of armed cops stand 
        in a room facing the monster at point-blank range. Trish, in a moment 
        of such sappiness that I began laughing loudly in my seat, tries to make 
        a deal with it: &quot;Take me! Take me! I'm stronger! You want me!&quot; 
        One would assume that the cops shove her aside mid-sentence and proceed 
        to pump the monster's guts full of lead. But no. <br>
      </p>
      <p>That would be too smart of them. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Characters who are smart are a big no-no in movies that are stupid.</p>
