      <p align="left">Ambassador Thomas Pickering '53 spoke in Pickard Theater 
        last Friday night to an auditorium filled with students, faculty, and 
        members of the community. In a speech entitled &quot;U.S. and China Now,&quot; 
        he illuminated the complexities of relations between the two nations based 
        upon his diplomatic experience.<br>
        Mr. Pickering began by speaking generally about the changes he has witnessed 
        in China over the past 40 years in his field. He said that the nation's 
        move toward westernization and a more capitalist economic system makes 
        a relationship with China &quot;a matter of incredible importance to the 
        United States.&quot;<br>
      </p>

        <table width="130" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right">
          <tr> 
            <td><img src="images/news05_pickering.jpg" width="130" height="196"></td>

          <tr> 
            <td><font size="2">Ambassador Thomas Pickering '53. (Courtesy of Boeing 
              Co.)</font></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p align="left">He further stated that, because of several factors, &quot;[The 
        United States is] working hard to see China as a regular player in the 
        system; to include China in regional and global institutions...[Things 
        such as] China's membership in the nuclear club, its permanent seat on 
        the UN Security Council, and its sheer size make it a hard player to ignore.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Mr. Pickering asserted that the nation has full access 
        to weapons of mass destruction, he also said that China &quot;is not yet 
        a world strategic power.&quot;<br>
        The ambassador insinuated that much is unknown about Chinese affairs. 
        In areas like world peace, terrorism, drugs, and international crime, 
        &quot;some cooperation exists...[however,] much can be further developed,&quot; 
        he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At several instances, Mr. Pickering wove some humor into 
        his mostly serious speech. He drew laughs after saying that &quot;Mao 
        would be rolling in his mausoleum&quot; if the late Chinese leader knew 
        of the nation's recent political changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After speaking more generally about progress in China and 
        international leaders' need to &quot;base talks on a common acceptance 
        of realities,&quot; Mr. Pickering summed up his planned speech by saying 
        that China is &quot;an extremely important country for the U.S.A, [one 
        that] will help to determine what happens in Asia&quot; and in many other 
        parts of the world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Following his speech, the Ambassador fielded several questions 
        from the crowd, answering inquiries ranging from his view of 'new' issues 
        in China (environmental concerns and the like) to comparing the Soviet 
        and Chinese Communist Party machines.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When asked about his most valuable career experience, Pickering 
        cited his United Nations work during the Middle East crisis. Calling it 
        an unprecedented international incident, he said that &quot;...perhaps 
        the greatest opportunity and greatest challenge I've had was at the UN 
        during the Gulf War.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Pickering's experience in conflict-ridden nations like 
        Jordan and Israel also drew a question regarding the current ethnic and 
        political situations of the region. The United States, according to the 
        ambassador, needs to use its influence in &quot;a particularly perilous 
        time in the Middle East,&quot; especially given the United States' record 
        of &quot;leadership in the past and our tremendous role at present.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Pickering, Americans &quot;should never be 
        complacent-we should continue to think about where we're going and not 
        rest on our [economic] laurels...We need to see the globe as something 
        that can represent great challenges for us.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Pickering also spoke about issues such as human rights 
        violations, the United States' 'One-China' policy, and environmental problems. 
        &quot;China is still heavily dependent on coal as a major power source, 
        which is a huge and difficult problem,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One audience member's question addressed current politics 
        in China, and Mr. Pickering indicated that he feels much can be improved: 
        &quot;The political system remains hierarchal, autocratic, and rigid, 
        despite economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;The question is, will China 
        exist economically more free and politically more bound forever? Will 
        rapid economic development produce demand for political change?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Pickering graduated cum laude from Bowdoin, with high 
        honors in history. He earned Masters degrees at Tufts and Melbourne Universities 
        and also spent time in the Navy before embarking on a career in international 
        diplomacy. Mr. Pickering has held more ambassadorial posts in his career 
        than anyone in United States history. Posts in Russia, India, Israel, 
        El Salvador, Nigeria, and Jordan line his resum&eacute;. He speaks many 
        languages including French, Spanish, Swahili, Arabic, and Hebrew.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Pickering's recent career includes positions as the 
        United States' United Nations representative from 1989-1993 and the Undersecretary 
        of State from 1997-2000. The ambassador currently holds the office of 
        Senior Vice President for International Relations at Boeing, Inc. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ambassador Pickering's talk was sponsored by the John C. 
        Donovan Lecture Fund, and was, as he stated, suggestive of &quot;some 
        great themes for term papers&quot; for Bowdoin students.<br>
