        Editor in Chief</font></p>
      <p align="left">Tuesday's terror attacks have brought attention to Maine 
        and even Brunswick.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Governor Angus King responded immediately Tuesday by shutting 
        down most state government offices and increasing security throughout 
        the state.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I do not believe that we are in any danger here in 
        Maine,&quot; King said, &quot;but it's essential to be prepared for any 
        and every possible circumstance.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Later security efforts intensified as evidence showed that 
        suspects spent time in the state just before the attacks.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At least two suspected terrorists flew to Boston from the 
        Portland International Jetport; two others are thought to have driven 
        from Portland to Boston. Investigators believe the terrorists stayed at 
        the Comfort Inn across from the Maine Mall in South Portland on Monday 
        night.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The FBI seized one car that had been parked at the Portland 
        Jetport and had been rented in Boston.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some have speculated that these terrorists entered Maine 
        by crossing the U.S./Canada border, possibly taking a ferry from Nova 
        Scotia. Investigations continue in Bangor, but efforts have focused more 
        in Portland. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Jetport re-opened yesterday evening, though with heavily 
        increased security. Police stationed on the access roads have been ordered 
        to stop and check all vehicles entering the jetport. Seven police officers, 
        as opposed to the normal three, are stationed inside the terminal at all 
        times.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Temporary curbside parking is now prohibited, and, per FAA 
        mandate, no one is allowed to park within 300 feet of the terminal until 
        further notice. Instead, people must park at a shuttle lot on Congress 
        Street.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bangor International Airport also re-opened yesterday.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Brunswick, the Brunswick Naval Air Station has heightened 
        its security and remains under Threat Condition Delta, the highest level 
        of security in the military. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since Tuesday, the Air Station has conducted searches on 
        all cars entering the base, leading to major congestion in Cook's Corner 
        during high-traffic times.<br>
        The air station has also cancelled its annual Great State of Maine Air 
        Show, originally to be held September 22 and 23, which has typically drawn 
        between 160,000 and 200,000 visitors.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Given the security posture of our military bases and 
        the unknown agenda of those who wish to do harm, it would not be prudent 
        for us to hold our air show this year,&quot; said Commanding Officer Captain 
        Keith Koon, in a statement posted on the station's website.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;These are difficult times for our nation and our Navy,&quot; 
        he said, &quot;and NAS Brunswick must continue to be 100 percent operationally 
        ready to fulfill its mission for our nation's security. Regrettably, an 
        air show would interfere with that mission.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bath Iron Works, one of the U.S. government's leading suppliers 
        of war ships, closed down Tuesday as a precautionary measure. It reopened 
        Wednesday, but has instated many security precautions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Under order from the U.S. Coast Guard, the mouth of the 
        Kennebec River (the river on which the BIW is located) has been closed 
        to all boat traffic. The river has been patrolled by Bath police.</p>
