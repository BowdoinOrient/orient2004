        Assistant Sports Editor</font></p>
      <p>His Airness has all but proclaimed his comeback. After months of testing 
        his body and his game against NBA players, Michael Jordan hinted on September 
        10 that he would return this season as a Washington Wizard because of 
        his &#147;love for the game.&#148; Although his knee was recently bothering 
        him, it is evidently no longer an issue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, I played in a couple of pick-up games with Brunswick 
        high school students to test my game and my old body. I left the games 
        with a strained lower left back, sore left buttocks from falling on my 
        behind, and a pulled left groin from trying to run a lot.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Like Jordan, I also have decided to hold the intramural basketball world 
        in suspense over whether or not I will return for the 3-on-3 season. Although 
        the press conference will not be held for a few more days, I love the 
        game still and will most likely be back&#151;but I&#146;m not saying for 
        sure yet.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After my pick-up games, it dawned on me that there are many more similarities 
        between the sixtime world champion and me. Honestly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In high school, Jordan was cut from the varsity basketball squad only 
        to come back the next year and prove that he was the best player in all 
        of North Carolina. I too was made to play JV during my sophomore year 
        only to make varsity as a senior and prove myself to be the best player 
        in the state of Colorado...at my position at least...in the Metro League...on 
        my team.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And the similarities continue to roll out from our humble beginnings. 
        Early in his career, Jordan relied heavily on his driving to the hoop 
        to make up for his sub-par shooting ability. I too must score all of my 
        points within five feet of the basket, primarily because I have yet to 
        develop that deadly jumper...or any jumper, really.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Jordan also made a name for himself as the best finisher in the game 
        by routinely dunking over seven footers and floating under the basket 
        for reverses. Recently, I just finished a game of Monopoly and won, thanks 
        to my hotels on Park Place and Boardwalk.<br>
      </p>
      <p>MJ can embarrass an opponent with a quick drive to the hoop, or he can 
        pull up and knock down a fade-away jumper. Often, I too drive my opponents 
        crazy with my taunts begging them to shoot the jumper because I am too 
        tired to stop them from driving. I also have pulled up next to my stereo 
        and listened to the Rolling Stones&#146; &#147;Fade Away.&#148; Good tune.<br>
      </p>
      <p>His Airness is also repudiated as one of the all time greats in NBA history 
        by claiming numerous MVP awards, scoring titles, and NBA Championships. 
      </p>
      <p>OK, I guess he has me there.<br>
      </p>
      <p>How about this one&#151;MJ tried to be a major league baseball player, 
        and thus followed his heart to play the game that he loved since childhood. 
        In third grade, I knew that I was going to play outside linebacker for 
        the Denver Broncos. Like Jordan, I was not cut out to play the game that 
        I loved&#151;largely because I am not cut or still in third grade where 
        everyone weighs 40 pounds&#151;not 340 pounds. Instead, I followed my 
        heart elsewhere&#151;to Bowdoin College where I consistently perform at 
        a high level, in intramural basketball. B league, of course.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And then there is the obvious&#151;the names. Michael Jordan and J.P. 
        Box. While at first they do not appear to be very similar, keep this in 
        mind: my little brother&#146;s name is Michael. Coincidence or fate? You 
        be the judge.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While by now the similarities appear to be overwhelming, I am sure that 
        there are still some of you who don&#146;t regard these eerie parallels 
        with any sense of amazement or awe. Others of you must be convinced that 
        Mike and I are one and the same. Thank you, Bowdoin, for teaching me so 
        wonderfully how to prove virtually any thesis.<br>
      </p>
