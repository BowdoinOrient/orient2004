        <font size="2">Genevieve Creedon</font></p>
      <p align="left">I sat down to write this article early Tuesday morning. 
        I wrote three sentences before deciding to check my e-mail. My brother 
        had sent me a note. As I opened it, I expected to read his usual three-sentence 
        email. Instead, I encountered the words: &quot;the world trade center 
        just got hit by a plane. I saw it from my window.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At first, I thought it was impossible. He must have been 
        hallucinating. I scrolled through several news websites and saw nothing 
        even remotely close to what my brother claimed to have seen, but sure 
        enough, ten minutes later, I was being called to come see the television. 
        My brother was right. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps it is because I am from New York, perhaps it is 
        because I know lots of people whose lives have undoubtedly been changed 
        by the loss of a family member or friend, or perhaps it is simply because 
        events such as Tuesday's tend to stir patriotism in the bosom of complacency. 
        Whatever it is, I have found myself to be more angry at this attack than 
        I have ever been before. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I, like most other people, have sat stunned and confused 
        about what seems to be an inexplicable act of terrorism. As I sit, writing 
        this, I can hear the television down the hall announcing that war may 
        be impending. For a few seconds, I think war might just be justifiable. 
        I want revenge. I want someone to be responsible. I want to be able to 
        blame someone for causing all this pain, and I want those who are responsible 
        to have some viable reason to justify their actions. In other words, I 
        want this tragedy to make sense. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I am usually a pacifist. Revenge is usually an absurd concept 
        to me. Anger is usually easy for me to let go of. I'm trying to understand 
        why all of this has happened; I'm trying to decide why I'm feeling so 
        upset by an event that theoretically isn't personal. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Maybe the fact that I have walked the same floors all the 
        people who died walked on has something to do with it. Maybe the fact 
        that my sister's husband works in the Trade Center and just happened not 
        to be there at the time of its destruction has something to do with it. 
        Maybe the fact that so many other people's families weren't spared by 
        such a lucky twist of fate has something to do with it. Maybe I even feel 
        guilty about being so far away from home so that I can't be with those 
        people who have been more closely affected by this tragedy. Mostly, I 
        think my reactions to the unwarranted deaths and pain are triggered by 
        a complete inability to understand. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The question &quot;why?&quot; is certainly the one on everyone's 
        lips. I haven't even bothered asking it, because there is no answer anyone 
        could come up with that would satisfy me. There is nothing so offensive 
        or threatening that could ever warrant killing a person in my eyes, never 
        mind hundreds.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My only rationalization is that the people responsible do 
        not understand what it is to be human. They don't realize the pain that 
        they have caused individuals throughout the world. That they know how 
        much pain they have caused on a national level is unquestionable, and 
        it seems rather obvious that causing that pain to the nation was the whole 
        idea. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is little doubt in my mind that this week's events 
        will be permanently imprinted in our minds and our hearts. They are events 
        that may take credit for tainting the idealism and faithful optimism of 
        our generation, among other catastrophic consequences.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And yet, in spite of the anger, the pain, the sorrow, and 
        the frustration, the word that has found permanence in my mind is forgiveness. 
        When we gather together to pray for the dead and the devastated families, 
        we should remember to forgive the perpetrators of this horror. Forgive 
        them for being so full of hate. Forgive them for ending so many lives. 
        Forgive them for hurting us in ways we don't even understand. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But, how can we forgive them? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I don't know how. I only know that we must. <br>
