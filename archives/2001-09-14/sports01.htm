      <p>The Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team started off its season with a 4-0 defeat 
        of Bridgewater State last Saturday. Jill Falwell '04, who was subsequently 
        named the NESCAC Player of the Week for her efforts, scored two goals 
        and had an assist in the team's win. The team hopes that its decisive 
        first win is but a small indication of the success that awaits them this 
        year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin women have a rich history of success in NESCAC. In addition 
        to boasting an overall winning percentage of .735, the team has reached 
        the NCAA tournament in each of its past six years -a distinction no other 
        NESCAC team can rival. Presently, the team is looking forward to a promising 
        season under the leadership of head coach John Cullen and senior tri-captains 
        Katie Sheridan, Jeanne Nicholson, and Allison Lavoie. <br>
      </p>

        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/sports03_wsoccer.jpg" width="250" height="309"></td>

        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Jill Falwell '04, NBSCAC player of the week. (Colin 
            LeCroy, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>

      <p>Nicholson is excited about the team's prospects, and expects that it 
        will enjoy yet another winning season. &quot;We are a young team, and 
        we have a lot to live up to, but we are planning on being successful like 
        we always have been,&quot; she said. &quot;Winning the NESCAC [championship] 
        is a real possibility for us.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nicholson was particularly enthusiastic about the outstanding play of 
        Emily Rizza '02, a goalie who returns to the team after studying abroad 
        during last season. Nicholson said that she thinks Rizza's contributions 
        will be of immeasurable value in the team's NESCAC title quest.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Success for the team also depends upon the ability of newcomers to fill 
        the void left by the graduation of seven senior starters. However, junior 
        forward Shellie Chessie suggested that the team isn't too worried about 
        an absence of experience. According to her, in preseason play, &quot;everybody 
        looked good. In particular, our freshman class is strong and has played 
        really well,&quot; she said.<br>
        Chessie went on to say that the team's starting lineup has been changed 
        dramatically, but that the squad has gelled and is playing well together.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The women's sound defeat of Colby (whom Bowdoin has not lost to in twenty-eight 
        years) during a preseason matchup suggests that the team has truly adjusted 
        to the pressures and changes of being a young team. The Bridgewater State 
        defeat seems to confirm this assumption.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team must face down some excellent opponents in order to continue 
        its string of early successes. The Lady Polar Bears play Williams tomorrow, 
        and follow with an Amherst matchup on Sunday. The following Saturday, 
        they face Middlebury. <br>
      </p>
      <p>All three home games are expected to be extremely competitive, and should 
        help to project how far the Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team can go this year.<br>
