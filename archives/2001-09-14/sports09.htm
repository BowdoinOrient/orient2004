      <p>The 2001 season looks to be a promising one for the Bowdoin Men's Golf 
        Team. Boasting a roster of fifteen players, the squad is looking to finish 
        in the top half of NESCAC, according to coach Terry Meagher. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This year's captains are seniors Brian Shuman and Andy McNearny. Rounding 
        out the pool of seniors are Pascal Chiasson, Bob Harmon and Simon McKay. 
        Others who will be competing include the following: Mike Fensterstock 
        '04, Nick Gladd '03, Mike Healey '03, Josh Jones '04, Seth Obed '03, Ed 
        Pierce '03, Jo Pierce '05, and Nathan Riddell '05. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;This [team] is a special group of people that represents the school 
        well,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;The players are a lot of fun to be around.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're looking forward to this program maturing into a formidable 
        force in NESCAC golf. If we can keep Shuman out of the woods and have 
        Gladd and McNearny shoot the same rounds in competition as in practice, 
        and have our younger players with promise produce it, it should be a really 
        fun year,&quot; he continued. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This weekend's Bowdoin Invitational, slated to take place September 16 
        and 17 at the Brunswick Golf Club, will be the Polar Bears' first test 
        of the season. On September 23, the men will travel to Waterville, Maine, 
        to face Colby's sterile Mules. The NESCAC golf championships will be hosted 
        by Williams College on September 29 and 30. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This season, the men's team will compete in a total of nine matches, 
        two of which will be hosted by the College at the Brunswick GC. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This fall marks the newly formed Bowdoin Women's Golf Team's inaguaral 
        season. The roster is comprised of six students: Tara Talbot '02, Kathryn 
        Crowley '02, Homa Mojtabai '02, Kristie Miller '02, Emily McKissock '03, 
        and Emily Blum '04. The team, under the tutelage of women's ice hockey 
        and softball coach Michelle Amidon, also practices at the BGC.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The players bring varying degrees of golf experience with them, but share 
        an enthusiasm for being part of Bowdoin's first women's team. &quot;Most 
        of the women on the team are pretty new to golf, so it's exciting for 
        us all to have the chance to play every day,&quot; Talbot said. &quot;Hopefully 
        our athleticism and our competitive nature will make up for our lack of 
        experience. Either way, I'm sure we'll all have a good time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In previous years, women who were interested in playing at the College 
        had to compete on the men's team, a situation that led many promising 
        female golfers to opt out of competing, according to Amidon. &quot;I'm 
        pretty pleased with the levels and numbers for this year,&quot; she said. 
        &quot;Now that we have a separate and defined women's program, increasing 
        both talent and numbers shouldn't be difficult.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The women's season includes four matches, the first being the Bowdoin 
        Invitational this weekend. On September 22, the Lady Polar Bears travel 
        to Massachusetts to compete against Wellesley. Bowdoin Women's Golf will 
        also represent at the NESCAC tournament, hosted by Williams on September 
        29. Their last competition will be the CBB tournament on October 6.</p>
