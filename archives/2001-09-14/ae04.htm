      <p>&quot;We are simply gonna change music forever, and the way people think 
        about music. And don't think we can't do it, we will.&quot; So said Sigur 
        Ros, a relatively new Icelandic band whose latest album, Agaetis Byrjun, 
        has just recently begun to the receive the attention it deserves. Agaetis 
        Byrjun was released in Iceland in 1999 and in the UK a year later. It 
        is the second album for the band, whose first release was the Steindor 
        Anderson EP. <br>

      <p>Critics everywhere have heaped praises upon praises on the album-the 
        spectrum has ranged from assertions that it is the most important band 
        of the 21st century, to comparisons of their album sounding like &quot;God 
        weeping tears in heaven.&quot; The album is good, scarily good in some 
        places, but I hesitate to endorse it, or the band, as the next Nirvana 
        on the basis of only one album. It isn't because they aren't good enough, 
        but because their music is often too complex and intricate to satisfy 
        the desires of a large audience.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The album is mellow to say the least. The songs are long, averaging around 
        seven minutes, and they wind their way through intricate orchestral arrangements 
        and varied changes, which sometimes blends the album into a continuous 
        river of sound. While this is relaxing, at times I found myself becoming 
        distracted, and forgetting that the music was even on. This is why, for 
        albums like this, a weak song that disrupts the flow is a problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately the song &quot;Hjartao Hamast&quot; is the only weak link; 
        the rest, especially &quot;Staraflur&quot;, &quot;Flugufrelsarinn&quot;, 
        &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot;, and the title track, &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot; 
        shine with a quiet, focused energy that manages to overcome the monotony 
        which is often problematic for this type of album.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The music on Agaetis Byrjun is methodic, purposeful, and infused with 
        mystery. It is undeniably new and modern, but often feels old, even ancient. 
        Some songs employ full orchestras, and there is a distinctive soft wall 
        of sound that guitarist Jonsi Birgisson creates by bowing his guitar instead 
        of strumming it. Songs move inexplicably back and forth between these 
        feelings of new and old. <br>
        &quot;Olsen Olsen&quot; is the best example. It begins with a plodding 
        baseline and slowly builds to a full symphony that, by the end, reminds 
        one of something from a late Beatles album.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The percussion on much of the album is strictly background. Brushes drag 
        slowly across snares and there are few driving beats. The exceptions are 
        breathtaking. &quot;Staraflur&quot;, whose movements can only be described 
        as classical, starts soft but builds with a piercing bass drum that sounds 
        like a beating heart. Strings and horns swirl all around it, until the 
        whole song is stripped away to only an unamplified electric guitar and 
        vocals. On &quot;Ny Batteri&quot;, the most &quot;rock-like&quot; song 
        on the album, Orri Pall Dyrasun pounds his drum kit so hard it sounds 
        as if he is going to punch holes through them and break his cymbals.<br>
        By far though, the most striking aspect of the sound of Sigur Ros is the 
        singing. All the lyrics are in Icelandic, so it is impossible to know 
        what the lead singer, Jonsi Birgisson, is singing about. It hardly seems 
        to matter, and gives the songs an even greater mystique. <br>
      </p>
      <p>His voice is otherworldly, due to the sound of the language and the effects 
        that are laid over the vocal track. Birgisson's gradual transition between 
        notes and songs, and his plaintive, brutally honest voice make his vocals 
        sound like an evanescent cream. He sings as if the notes are the last 
        drops of water he is ringing out of a rag.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As an album, this is one of the most noteworthy made in the last twenty 
        years. Honestly. It is not for everyone, however; it progresses slowly 
        and can drag at times, but those moments are inconsequential in the larger 
        context of the album. Agaetis Byrjun manages to sound eerily haunting 
        and unabashedly triumphant at the same time. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The next Nirvana? The next Beatles? Absolutely not. The songs on Agaetis 
        Byrjun are closer to symphonies than tidy pop nuggets. Sigur Ros will 
        not change music as we know it, simply for the fact that most people will 
        not have the patience or willingness to listen close enough. But they 
        should.<br>
