      <p align="left">Giving one of the few science-related Common Hour talks 
        in recent years, Marcia Barinaga '77 spoke September 7 on the numerous 
        ethical issues concerning the sciences today. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Barinaga centered her Common Hour talk not on the profession 
        of science journalism, but rather on the evolution of science both in 
        the public eye and behind the bench. <br>
      </p>

            <i>Science</i>, listens to a question at last week's Common Hour. 
            (Karsten Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      </table>
      <p align="left">As an undergraduate at Bowdoin interested in the sciences 
        in the mid '70s, it was apparent to Barinaga that many of her classmates 
        did not share her curiosity on the subject.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I learned a lot about expressionist art and the political 
        philosophy of Hobbes and Rousseau around the dinner table, but the exchange 
        was not reciprocal,&quot; Barinaga said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A Bowdoin graduate with a double major in biochemistry and 
        environmental studies, Barinaga went on to graduate school at the University 
        of California-San Diego where she received a Ph.D. in biology. Shelater 
        completed work at Stanford as a post doctorate, in the area of molecular 
        neurobiology.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Barinaga adopted an interest in science journalism and underwent 
        training at the University of California Santa Cruz. Since then, she has 
        been working as a correspondent for a number of science magazines, including 
        Nature, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Dallas Morning 
        News, and her current focus, Science.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a science journalist who also has experience in research, 
        Barinaga has deep insight into the communication and interactions between 
        scientists and non-scientists; she emphasized the importance of being 
        informed on scientific issues affecting society and encouraged rational 
        discussion between the two multitudes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Science and, in particular, biology is in the public 
        spotlight today more than ever and one reason is because the research 
        is going so well. It's producing results and products that have an impact 
        on society,&quot; Barinaga said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the subject of gene therapy, Barinaga brought up the 
        case of 18-year-old Jessie Gelsinger, who was suffering from a milder 
        version of a genetic disease that impaired his body's ability to remove 
        ammonia from blood. In September 1999, Gelsinger volunteered for a new 
        gene therapy treatment aimed at patients with a much more severe case 
        of the disease. He died from a massive immune attack, a complication that 
        had been noted in early animal testing of the drug. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This incident and others like it gave the public reason 
        to doubt and mistrust their word and that slowed down a line of research 
        that I think does have great potential for society,&quot; Barinaga said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Genetically engineered food, another hot topic, is generating 
        concerns such as the potential for these crops to develop a resistance 
        to herbicides, as well as the possibility of interbreeding with surrounding 
        vegetation. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Barinaga pointed out many positive arguments for the genetic 
        modification of crops including the removal of allergens from particular 
        foods, such as peanuts, and the incorporation of immunizations in foods 
        such as potatoes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Barinaga, as of March 2000, one-third of the 
        US corn crop and one-half of the US cotton and soybean crops are already 
        genetically modified. Yet people, especially those affected economically 
        by the decision, are still very anxious about the introduction of more 
        of these types of crops.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This kind of emotionality associated with it really 
        does a lot to block the potential for any rational debate,&quot; Barinaga 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final issue Barinaga raised in her talk is perhaps the 
        most controversial and publicly debated one to date: stem cell research. 
        As Barinaga explained, stem cells are pluripotent cells, that is, they 
        can grow to differentiate into any cell in the body. It appears that these 
        cells can only be derived from embryos, which would curtail much of the 
        debate relating to the use of adult stem cells instead of embryonic cells. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With these three issues in the forefront of scientific debates, 
        Barinaga reminded all that society has been in a position of doubt before 
        regarding scientific advancements and technology.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Some people are repelled today by the idea of foreign 
        genes in their food or of using embryos for research in human cloning. 
        But the generation before rejected putting animal genes in bacteria and 
        before that, society was very leary of in vitro fertilization. Today in 
        vitro fertilization is welcomed as a life-giving technology for infertile 
        couples, and diabetics are injecting recombinant insulin&#133;&quot; Barinaga 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She took note of the differences in both circumstance and 
        purpose involved in each specific technology, but also admitted that the 
        public may accept all these advances just as they have in the past.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We shouldn't get to that point by default. We should 
        get there by intelligent discussion,&quot; Barinaga said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Scientists need to be willing to discuss issues rationally 
        with non-scientists and to refrain from donning that cloak of superiority&#133;that 
        paternalistic attitude. But it's also really important for everyone to 
        have a basic level of scientific literacy if society is going to respond 
        intelligently to new technologies.&quot;<br>
