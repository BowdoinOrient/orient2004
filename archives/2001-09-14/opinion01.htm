      <p align="left">Most of us have probably never heard of Gotthold Ephraim 
        Lessing. Lessing, however, is along with Goethe and Schiller, one of the 
        most often read or analyzed German authors of the 18th century. If Goethe 
        is the Shakespeare of German literature, then perhaps Lessing parallels 
        Christopher Marlowe in that Goethe mimicked Lessing's style. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I hadn't heard of him until I began a German Literature 
        class this semester and became overwhelmed by the modern lessons in his 
        classic Nathan Der Weise, or &quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;(remember English 
        is a Germanic language). It could be argued that it is one of the most 
        meaningful works of dramatic literature at this moment in time. The lessons 
        in it apply not only to the Middle East today, but of course to UN delegates 
        at the Durban Conference, and to us here at Bowdoin as we work to combat 
        discrimination and overcome the horrific tragedies in New York, Washington, 
        and Pittsburgh. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lessing's classic play is set in Jerusalem in the 12th century. 
        Nathan is a wise, wealthy Jewish merchant whom others try to trick into 
        giving them money. One of the most famous and most explicated passages 
        in all of German literature is where a Muslim Saladin tries to manipulate 
        Nathan into giving him money. Saladin bets Nathan that he is not wise 
        enough to figure out which of the three major religions in Jerusalem?Christianity, 
        Judaism, and Islam?is the most divinely inspired Lessing uses and slightly 
        alters &quot;The Parable of the Rings&quot;, borrowed from Decameron, 
        by Italian renaissance author Giovanni Boccacia, to explain his protagonist's 
        answer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For those of us who are not familiar with Lessing's version 
        of this parable, it is one that is profound in its simplicity. The story 
        is about a man whose father gives him a ring, to give to his son, as a 
        family heirloom. It is meant to be given to the most worthy son as an 
        example that he is the &quot;true heir.&quot; However, generations later, 
        the man with the ring has three sons who are all worthy to receive the 
        heirloom. Instead of choosing one, the father has a good jeweler copy 
        the original ring twice and gives all of his sons &quot;the ring.&quot; 
        Of course the sons soon realized what the father had done and quarreled 
        among each other over who was the worthy recipient of the ring. Consequently, 
        they take the matter to court. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The true message of the story is found in the wisdom which 
        Lessing's judge imparts on the three brothers: &quot;live as if you are 
        the true heir and then return to me in a thousand years and we'll see 
        who earns the right to wear the ring.&quot; Obviously we can see that 
        in nearly a thousand years since the setting of this play, little has 
        changed in the Middle East or the world. Last week four explosions went 
        off in Israel, taking the lives of seven innocent Israelis. And it is 
        speculated that the attacks in the United States were orchestrated by 
        a religious fundamentalist group. The threat of terrorism is now tragically 
        more real to us here in America than it ever had been previously in our 
        history. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Earlier this week, pundits have thrown different thoughts 
        across the airwaves as the best response to this cowardly attack on our 
        American soul. Here again I seek Lessing's prescience for guidance. At 
        the end of his play, many of the characters realize they are related to 
        each other. Though they feel happy, it is not clear that their prejudices 
        have changed much. Again, one cannot help but think not only of the Middle 
        East and the World Trade Center, but of the recently concluded UN conference 
        on racism in Durban, South Africa. There, the delegates used lofty language 
        condemning racism and using the genome project as a demonstration of our 
        bond as a human family. </p>
      <p align="left">However, I doubt that the world's problems with hate can 
        be seriously ameliorated by one overrated conference. It will take leadership 
        on the part of the world's nations to teach their people that radical 
        and violent factions within faiths do not represent entire religions. 
        This week's tragedy and Lessing's play challenge us to learn that it is 
        not necessarily best to be the winner, it is rather best to be the wiser.<br>
