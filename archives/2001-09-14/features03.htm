        Staff Writer</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As we begin to settle into the new year at Bowdoin, our 
        classes decided, rooms fully decorated, and neighbors met, our thoughts 
        may turn to other areas of our lives: namely sex and relationships in 
        their various incarnations. Despite the statistics tour guides like to 
        spew out regarding our extraordinary marriage rates, Bowdoin students 
        may actually spend their four years exploring an array of romantic options. 
        Sometimes there seem to be too many options while at other times they 
        feel trapped. Therefore, this week I have tried to create a reference 
        guide delineating IN WHAT FORMS DOES SEX AND ROMANCE EXIST AT BOWDOIN?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The Random Hookup</b>: Almost always associated with 
        alcohol, this is the easiest and most common affair. In the real world, 
        this may be known as the &quot;one-night stand.&quot; A random hookup 
        necessitates two people, at least one of whom has usually decided to &quot;hook 
        up&quot; that night, and very high sex drives (often influenced by adolescence, 
        beer, tightly packed parties, and either scant clothing due to warm weather 
        or boredom due to cold weather). Participants are commonly in different 
        classes. Generally, the two people have been introduced before, so they 
        feel comfortable enough to strike up a conversation that includes arm-touching, 
        eye contact, and assorted other innuendo. This interaction lasts anywhere 
        from a half hour to two and results in the couple returning to one party's 
        room, &quot;sexiling&quot; the roommates, and engaging in anything from 
        basic kissing to intercourse. Sleeping over: optional. The random hookup 
        rarely leads to anything, save some awkward encounters later on-&quot;Oh 
        my God, I hooked up with him the other week at _____&quot;. (I can only 
        think of one case in which a random hookup led to a date that subsequently 
        led to a relationship. But I must stress that this is an extremely isolated 
        incident.) <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The Continuous (or Regular) Hookup</b>: What happens 
        when the people involved in the random hookup &quot;clicked&quot; physically 
        or one or more is really desperate? Anything between a hookup and a relationship. 
        Participants generally like to say &quot;we just hook up&quot; or &quot;we're 
        kind of together, I guess, but we are NOT going out.&quot; May last for 
        a while and include a minimal email relationship, but no real emotional 
        involvement is expected. (&quot;Expected&quot; being a key word here, 
        for unfortunately, in many cases, emotional involvement develops and ultimately 
        causes stress, tears and name-calling. This may be avoided with the substitution 
        of basic human kindness and decency in place of misleading clich&eacute;s 
        that may be deemed &quot;what she/he wants to hear.)&quot; Once again, 
        I can only think of a few examples of the continuous hookup leading to 
        anything more. Also leads to awkwardness-&quot;She hates me because last 
        year we were hooking up, and then one night I &#133;&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The Friends Who Hookup</b>: Has potential to be either 
        the least or the most complex of the bunch. In its benevolent form, two 
        friends (who have often had a few beers) have not gotten any in a while 
        and therefore agree to help each other out. Neither is particularly attracted 
        to the other and they remain friends, perhaps even closer than before, 
        having gotten all sexual tension out of the way. This is fine. It is also 
        possible, though, that a &quot;Continuous Hookup&quot; will ensue and 
        therein resides the danger. One or both of them may begin to think, &quot;Well, 
        we really get along, and I am attracted to him/her too. So, if it makes 
        sense for us to 'go out' there is a) the possibility that the other party 
        does not feel the same way, and the friendship may be ruined, or b) the 
        possibility that a relationship will begin. </p>
      <p align="left">It is true that &quot;Friends Who Hookup&quot; may make 
        fabulous couples and one day become another marriage stat. However, it 
        is possible that while two people get along and are perhaps even attracted 
        to one another, they may lack that ineffable &quot;spark&quot; that is 
        needed to sustain a loving relationship. Attraction, loneliness and/or 
        desperation can blind the couple to this for a month or even a year; and 
        when they do, if they are unlucky enough to be in the same close group 
        of friends, they may also realize that although they have made a mistake, 
        it becomes very difficult to disentangle oneself when there are others 
        involved. But give them time, and they will soon be turned off by and 
        even disgusted by the other and exchange nasty emails frequently. Research 
        shows that only time and sycophantic behavior can heal such wounds. </p>
      <p align="left">Thus the hypothesis: If and only if &quot;Friends Who Hookup&quot; 
        truly believe they can make it to &quot;The Healthy Bowdoin Relationship&quot; 
        (see below) then they should go for it; or else they should be wary of 
        the path they tread. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>The Healthy Bowdoin Relationship</b>: This occurs when 
        two people who see each other often (indicating many shared interests)-but 
        unburdened by a history of friendship-realize that they are attracted 
        to each other. They get to know one another better and realize that their 
        attraction is more than physical. One of the two, a common friend, or 
        an uninhibited observer will bring up the fact that their feelings are 
        mutual. Very important to success is that neither of the involved have 
        a boyfriend or girlfriend at home. </p>
      <p align="left">The couple may, at this point, begin to hookup but they 
        are not in immediate danger of any of the problems above, because they 
        have laid a sound foundation, hold no illusions of the other and have 
        the same sort of feelings upon entering the &quot;Healthy Bowdoin Relationship.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In conclusion, I hope I have not touched upon any nerves. 
        Rather, this simplified catalogue is intended to remind you what your 
        options are, here, beneath the pines. I would like to stress, moreover, 
        that these are hardly the only possibilities; they are but the most common 
        and easiest situations to find oneself in. And do not despair you Polar 
        Bears who leave parties with your own two hands in your own two pockets. 
        Just as enjoyable may be the evenings you rush home to call Dominos before 
        two and share pizza and laughter with good friends. </p>
