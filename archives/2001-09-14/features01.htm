      <p align="left">Quite early one morning in October '57, I climbed onto the 
        roof to observe a tiny man-made object streaking across the sky: Sputnik, 
        the first satellite. The Space Age had dawned. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Down below on Planet Earth, the Cold War continued unabated. 
        Three years later, the Soviets shot down a U-2 spy plane high over Russia. 
        This act would wreck President Eisenhower's Open Skies plan, which had 
        been launched at a superpower summit in Geneva.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Across the hall from me lived an aspiring black actor named 
        Roscoe Lee Browne, who would one day star in major Hollywood films with 
        the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and John Wayne. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Roscoe, at the time, was managing the career of his friend 
        Leontyne Price, who had just graduated from the Julliard School of Music 
        and was destined for international stardom as an opera singer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He and I first got talking in the chow line of the International 
        House cafeteria. Roscoe recommended the spinach; it would 'put lead in 
        my pencil.'<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After a recital Leontyne gave at International House, I 
        got to know her too and was invited to a party at her place in the Village. 
        I also met her husband, William Warfield, the original Porgy in 'Porgy 
        and Bess.' <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Like so many people I was to encounter in New York, Roscoe 
        was gay, a term not openly used yet as many people still tried to keep 
        their homosexuality secret.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While convalescing at Harry's from my bout of hepatitis, 
        I began exploring Manhattan. One day, while sitting by the fountain in 
        Washington Square, I got talking to another aspiring thespian. Though 
        actually 'Negro', as people then still said, Ronald, with smooth black 
        hair and light skin, could have been taken for Latin American. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A passionate fan of Big Band music and band leader Stan 
        Kenton, he also was fond of classical music. There ensued a heated argument 
        about the different approaches to Beethoven (his favorite composer and 
        mine too), and of conductors like Arturo Toscanini and Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler. 
        Furtw&auml;ngler's tempi were too slow, Ron claimed. Toscanini made the 
        Ninth sound like Big Band music, I countered.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Born and brought up on Chicago's South Side, Ron had enlisted 
        in the Army, still segregated and, lying about his race, been assigned 
        to an all-white unit, that was stationed, like myself a few years later, 
        in Germany. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having tried without success to get into the Actor's Studio 
        of Lee Strasberg, with whom his great idol and 'method actor' Marlon Brando 
        had studied, Ron eventually was accepted by Herbert Berghof, another great 
        name among drama teachers at the time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Wish me luck,&quot; he said, on his way to an audition, 
        as we parted. <br>
        Next day Harry and I left for Provincetown. Along with philanthropist 
        Walter Chrysler and the German &eacute;migr&eacute; painter Hans Hoffman, 
        Harry was to judge the painting competition held annually there. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That finished, we called on Harry's old friend Leonard Bernstein 
        and his wife Felicitas at their summer home on Martha's Vineyard. Showing 
        us his studio over the garage, completely bare except for grand piano 
        and cushions strewn about the floor, the composer of Westside Story explained 
        he did his composing lying on the floor. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;So does Herbert von Karajan,&quot; I blurted out, 
        in reference to one of my conducting idols. Lenny gave me a long and hard 
        look. &quot;Fuck Karajan, Ludwig.&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On our return, I had a surprise call from Ron, to whom I 
        must have given Harry's number. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He asked me if I wanted to go to Coney Island with him. 
        Borrowing Harry's car, a Chevy convertible, I went to pick Ron up at his 
        room on the Westside. He came to the door stark naked. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Coming back from the beach, I introduced my new friend to 
        Harry who treated him with great courtesy, but may have guessed what would 
        happen next. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not long after, I blithely announced I was moving to the 
        Westside. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I'd rented a room on 71st Street, I explained, just off 
        Central Park West (a block from the Dakota Apartment Towers where John 
        Lennon was to live and die). Ron was to share it with me. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'll see you through this,&quot; Harry said, words 
        I've never forgotten. Naturally, I felt bad about leaving him so abruptly. 
        All the more so, in retrospect, as Harry was tragically killed when run 
        over by a truck, aged only 58 in 1972. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Life with Ron however wasn't to be a bowl of cherries either. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My new friend was a classical Oedipal case. Ron's father, 
        half white, had killed himself when Ron was only eight. Henceforth the 
        light-skinned little boy, named after matinee idol Ronald Colman, shared 
        the deserted marital bed with his black Mom, an ardent Colman fan. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Remaining on friendly terms with Harry, I used to walk across 
        the Park to meet him at the Collection. There was such tight security 
        at the Frick; I would be escorted up to his office by an armed guard, 
        most of whom were Irish. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On Sundays there were concerts in the Rotunda given by famous 
        musicians such as Wanda Landowska, grande dame of the harpsichord. Landowska 
        used to wear elbow-length gloves that she laboriously removed before starting 
        to play. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After such glimpses of cultured high life on the East Side, 
        I would, without regrets, return to Ron and low life on the Westside, 
        less cultured but more exciting. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There was only one drawback. Having dropped out of Columbia 
        Graduate School, with my living expenses no longer paid by my sponsor 
        old Nellie, I had to start thinking about getting a job. <br>
