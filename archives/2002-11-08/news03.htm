      <p align="left">Beginning yesterday, over 100 high school seniors, who describe 
        themselves as students of color, traveled from 18 states to get a sense 
        of Bowdoin beyond what the guidebooks and rankings say. The Bowdoin fall 
        invitational for prospective class of 2007 students kicked off yesterday 
        after long days of waiting around in airports, bus trips, and shuttle 
        rides for the invitees.</p>
      <p>&quot;All of the 118 visiting students are very talented young people 
        who have so much to contribute to the Bowdoin community,&quot; said Erby 
        Mitchell, director for multicultural relations and the head of planning 
        for the weekend. He hopes that students will settle in and experience 
        what Bowdoin has to offer. </p>
      <p>&quot;This weekend is a chance for people who haven't had a chance to 
        look at the college to do so. It's the most important thing we do all 
        year for our student of color recruitment,&quot; said Dean of Admissions 
        James Miller.</p>
      <p>This weekend will mark new leadership for the program with Mitchell taking 
        the post held the past four years by Fumio Sugihara, now assistant dean 
        of admissions. Speaking about his predecessor, Mitchell said, &quot;Fumio 
        has been instrumental in diversifying this place. He has invested four 
        years of his life to his alma mater to make this place more diverse.&quot;</p>
      <p> &quot;Bowdoin has become increasingly diverse in the broadest sense 
        in the last few years,&quot; said President Mills. &quot;This is the result 
        of the committed effort across the entire community to make Bowdoin accessible 
        to the best and brightest regardless of race or income.&quot;</p>
      <p>This inclusive focus is marked by what Mitchell called, &quot;a uniquely 
        personal feel.&quot; Wil Smith, director of multicultural student programs, 
        added, &quot;The broadening to where the entire campus hosts this population, 
        not just students of color hosting students of color, is a big deal. This 
        embrace is positive and offers the students a realistic view of Bowdoin.&quot;</p>
      <p>President Barry Mills extended the invitation, &quot;To come and get 
        to know our community. When we say we are diverse and committed, visitors 
        need to get a sense of how true it really is. This small college in Maine 
        is a picture of what America is.&quot;</p>
      <p>The weekend will be full of activities and opportunities for prospective 
        students to get to know the Bowdoin community. Students can attend an 
        art lecture, Common Hour with Dr. Robert Vilas, a play in Memorial Hall, 
        hypnotist Dale K, Gospel Fest put on by the Bowdoin Christian Fellowship, 
        a dance sponsored by the African-American Student Organization, a Korean 
        dance performance, and a salsa-merengue dance sponsored by the Latin American 
        Students Organization.</p>
      <p>All visiting students will also have admissions interviews which caps 
        off the newly instituted application process for acceptance to the November 
        invitational. &quot;We had 143 applicants and will only have 118 attendees. 
        Our goal this year was to get the most serious students to come because 
        the college makes a huge commitment and investment to bring them here,&quot; 
        said Mitchell.</p>
      <p>&quot;I didn't know anything about Bowdoin before I got here,&quot; said 
        Jerry Edwards '04, a product of the invitational in Fall 1999, &quot;I 
        definitely made the right decision to come here. I was impressed by the 
        passion of the people around me here regardless of what they look like. 
        I'm growing and Bowdoin's a great place for me to do this.&quot;</p>
