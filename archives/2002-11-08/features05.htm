        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        DUDLEY COE HEALTH CENTER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;It seems like there are a lot of people 
        here struggling with eating disorders. What can we do to help out?&quot; 
        P.W.</p>
      <p>Dear P.W.: We don't know the exact prevalence of eating disorders on 
        campus, but we do know that it's too high.</p>
      <p align="left">
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, over 5 million Americans 
        suffer from eating disorders. Studies have estimated that up to half of 
        female college students consider themselves &quot;extremely worried&quot; 
        about body image, weight management, or out-of-control eating. At Bowdoin, 
        according to last Spring's Survey of students, over 40 percent of women 
        describe themselves as only &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;never&quot; 
        satisfied with their weight, and an even higher number report &quot;feeling 
        fat&quot;. Over one-third of Bowdoin students report feeling pressured 
        to eat or limit their eating at least once or twice weekly, and nearly 
        half report feeling negatively impacted by someone else's eating habits.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Nationally, the statistics are somewhat clearer. Some 15 percent of young 
        women have at least substantially disordered eating troubles. Some 1,000 
        of those women die each year from complications of anorexia nervosa alone, 
        most commonly from suicide.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The non-fatal medical complications of eating disorders can be debilitating. 
        Anemia, lowered immune function, bleeding disorders, pancreatitis and 
        kidney stones are not uncommon. Loss of body fat and malnutrition quickly 
        lead to hormonal dysfunction and thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). 
        Bone loss can certainly lead to stress fractures, but more importantly, 
        can rob young women of the skeletal strength they will need for the rest 
        of their lives. Osteoporosis in undernourished women cannot be prevented 
        by taking birth control pills, and if prolonged, can be irreversible.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The most common eating disorders include bulimia nervosa (binging and 
        purging) and anorexia nervosa (food restricting). Compulsive exercising 
        and over-exercising, either in combination with restricting, binging or 
        purging, or on their own, belong to this same family of troubles. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even normal exercising by an underweight, undernourished individual can 
        be quite dangerous. With excessive weight loss, the heart (a muscle, after 
        all) thins and gets smaller and weaker. Its ability to pump harder and 
        faster on demand is compromised, and normal elevations of heart rate, 
        blood pressure and oxygen consumption, all healthy responses to the aerobic 
        challenge of exercise, become impaired. Abnormal heart beats and conduction 
        abnormalities commonly result, and these can prove dangerous indeed. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In trying to help a friend with a possible eating disorder, it's important 
        to remember that the disordered eating likely represents an attempted 
        solution to other problems. It may represent an effort to cope with other 
        inner struggles, and to communicate the pain of those struggles. A friend 
        might be trying to manage the anxiety of low self-esteem, feelings of 
        helplessness, problems at school, or troubled relationships with family 
        or others. Disordered eating and exercising behaviors are intended to 
        be self-protecting, but in reality become self-destructive and very dangerous.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you speak to a friend about a possible eating disorder, stay focused 
        on how you feel about what's happening to her or him. Express your concerns 
        about specific changes you've noticed or observations you've made (about 
        her or him as a person, not about the disordered eating itself). You'll 
        need to have realistic goals for your conversation. Prepare yourself for 
        the possibility that you'll make your friend defensive and even angry. 
        Hopefully, you'll be able to open the door to talking more, to show your 
        support and concern, and to offer to help get help.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are many resources on campus for help with eating disorders. Feel 
        free to contact someone at the Health Center, the Counseling Center, or 
        W.A.R.R.I.O.R.S. The Health and Counseling Services both have on their 
        websites a quick and confidential on-line screening test for eating disorders, 
        depression, and alcohol problems. Both websites also have information 
        and links for further reading about eating disorders. Check out the American 
        Anorexia and Bulimia Association at www.aabainc.org, &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot; 
        at www.goaskalice.columbia.edu, &quot;Something Fishy&quot; at www.somethingfishy.org, 
        or &quot;About Face&quot; at www.about-face.org.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We live in a culture that idealizes distorted body images and equally 
        distorted lifestyle expectations. We all need to do our part to start 
        changing our culture. We must also be willing to reach out to each other, 
        to try to understand each other, to support each other in our struggles. 
        This means trying to build a sense of true community here at Bowdoin. 
        Maybe it is our obligation to each other-and to ourselves. Certainly the 
        effects can be life-changing. They might also be life-saving.</p>

        To all of our healths!</p>
