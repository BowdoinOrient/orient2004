        <font size="2">TIMOTHY J. RIEMER <br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The past week's economic news seem to indicate that the 
        economy is approaching a fork in the road that will determine whether 
        it continues to recover or whether it loses the little steam that it has 
        gained and falters once again. The economy appears to be coming to a screeching 
        halt. In the economic news for October that has been released since Tuesday, 
        there has been only one positive economic indicator. The growth rate of 
        the service sector decreased. Factory orders fell 2.3 percent and manufacturing 
        declined. The unemployment went back up one tenth of a percent to 5.7 
        percent. The only positive indicator about the economy from October is 
        that its growth rate, or annualized gross domestic product surged 3.1 
        percent from 1.3 percent in the previous quarter. This rapid boost in 
        GDP, however, was driven by strong sales in the auto industry. Without 
        the auto industry, the economy only grew by 1.5 percent, a rather daunting 
        figure that suggests that the current growth rate might not be able to 
        last. Even with this strong growth rate, the economy looks as if it might 
        enter the red once again.</p>
      <p align="left">In light of all these negative indicators, the Federal Reserve 
        Board decided in their Wednesday meeting to cut interest rates 50 basis 
        points, or half a percentage point to 1.25 percent. The vote to cut the 
        interest rate was the first unanimous vote by the Fed in almost a year. 
        This seems to indicate that the members of the Fed Board feel that the 
        economic recovery might stall. The Fed also changed their risk assessment 
        stating that the risks that they saw for the economy were not only weakness 
        of the economy but also inflation as they lowered interest to below the 
        inflation rate of 1.8 percent. This seems to worry many people, because 
        the last time the Fed cut rates to below the inflation, we saw the high 
        inflation rates of the 1970s. However, this, in my opinion, raises a bigger 
        concern than inflation. This seems to indicate that the Fed might be trying 
        to curtail the possibility of deflation, which is becoming an increasing 
        concern as prices fall. Deflation is one of the economic crises that have 
        kept the Japanese economy in stagnation for more than a decade now. Many 
        signs indicate that prices will continue to drop. The increase in the 
        unemployment rate and the 0.4 percent decrease in consumer spending are 
        only two of the factors that point to deflation. These factors suggest 
        that consumers will not be able to purchase goods and services as they 
        do not have the money. The lack of demand, will in return drive down prices 
        to the point where consumers can once again afford goods and services.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The most interesting aspect surrounding all of this news is the performance 
        of the stock market. In the past five days of trading, the Dow has ended 
        up each day. Since the close on October 31, the Dow has increased 373.94 
        points to close at 8771.01 on Wednesday. Since October 9, when the Dow 
        reached its lowest point in several years at 7286.27, the Dow has risen 
        1484.74 points. In this whirlwind of bearish news on the economy, this, 
        in my opinion, is the light at the end of the tunnel. Changes in the market 
        usually precede changes in the overall economy. The strength of the market, 
        despite weak economic news, could mean that the economy is gearing towards 
        a solid recovery. This relationship between market changes and changes 
        in the economy, however, is not very strong and is not a solid sign of 
        future improvement in the economy but the market does appear to be recovering, 
        and this is always good. In this economy, with business investment being 
        one of the weakest parts of the economy and consumer spending, although 
        declining, having been a strong part of the economy during these tough 
        times, the turnaround in the markets would, in my mind, lead to an economic 
        recovery riding on the coattails of increased business investment. The 
        turnaround in the markets would lead to an increase in business investment 
        because the market turnaround means that firms would have more money, 
        which in turn means they can spend more.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This potential market turnaround could be hurt by economic problems stifling 
        investor confidence. If we run into further economic problems before the 
        economy truly recovers, then this might make the investor very wary about 
        investing his or her money in the markets amid economic uncertainty. The 
        economy and the markets are truly at a fork in the road. The economy and 
        markets could go just as easily go into another recession as it could 
        recover.</p>
