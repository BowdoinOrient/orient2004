      <p align="left">After a disappointing, but standings-wise meaningless, 0-0 
        tie against Bates last Saturday, the Bowdoin Men's Soccer Team is primed 
        and ready to challenge Amherst, Middlebury, and Williams for the NESCAC 
        tournament crown at Pickard Field this weekend.</p>
      <p align="left">
        For the seniors on the team-Kevin Folan, Bart McMann and Chris Fuller-this 
        weekend will mark their final opportunity to capture the NESCAC title 
        and the automatic NCAA tournament bid that accompanies it. These three 
        seniors have had a profound influence on the program since arriving on 
        campus in 1999.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We have a very young team. I think [the captain's] have done a terrific 
        job this season,&quot; said head coach Brian Ainscough. While it is the 
        Polar Bear players who make the difference on the field, Ainscough is 
        the general who has successfully led his troops into battle so many times 
        this fall.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Coach Ainscough is the best manager in the NESCAC,&quot; said McMann. 
        &quot;He's an honest man who demands a lot of hard work from his players. 
        I feel I have improved every year under his tutelage, and I hope to deliver 
        him a championship this season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Such praise for Ainscough is consistent among the Bowdoin players. A tough 
        coach who is both respected and commanding of respect, Ainscough is not 
        afraid to put himself on the line to defend one of his players, whether 
        it is against an official or an opponent. The fierce temper of the former 
        1983 Irish national team player has rubbed off onto McMann as well.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I play with a lot of emotion on the field and often my emotions 
        get the best of me. I hope my actions demonstrate to the team my willingness 
        to work hard and give a 'dig out' to every other player on the field,&quot; 
        said the fiery midfielder.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Playing with emotion and confidence is different than downright arrogance, 
        however. McMann talks about his personal desire to win a championship 
        for his coach and the team's &quot;desire to work hard and win a championship 
        for [Bowdoin president] Barry Mills.&quot; Some captains from other teams 
        in this weekend's tournament apparently weren't McMann's classmates in 
        Humility 101.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On the Williams website, an article features several quotes from senior 
        co-captain Alex Blake. For those of you attending this weekend's tournament, 
        give Blake, #9, a nice Bowdoin hello for all of us. According to this 
        forward, the NESCAC tournament is a mere formality. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Said Blake, &quot;Amherst has a more skillful team than Bowdoin I think, 
        but we're definitely better than both of them. There's nothing we'd like 
        more than to beat Amherst on Saturday, and then beat Bowdoin's [butt] 
        on their home field on Sunday.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This confidence comes even after the Ephs dropped each game they played 
        against Amherst and Bowdoin this season. Unfortunately for Blake and his 
        teammates, their best skill will not be applicable, as the game is soccer 
        is predominantly played on one's feet, not their knees. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For example, just last season, a Williams player used his knee to break 
        sophomore Jacques Guana's arm, a cheapshot move that almost brought Ainscough 
        to blows with the Williams coach.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While Williams players joked on the sidelines on course to a runaway win, 
        tempers flared on the Bowdoin sideline, only fueling the fire for this 
        weekend. The most ridiculous aspect of Blake's comment is that Williams 
        won't play either Amherst or Bowdoin until Sunday, and then only if they 
        defeat Middlebury on Saturday. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Polar opposites of Williams, Bowdoin is confident and level headed entering 
        the tournament, knowing from last weekend's experience that any NESCAC 
        team is capable of wining any given game in this balanced conference.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Williams team, also known as the training squad for the Jamaican national 
        team, features three Jamaican players, Blake included. Though Jamaica 
        has been independent from Britain for nearly 40 years, Blake still believes 
        in the monarchial system.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We are sure that we'll show everybody that we are still the kings 
        of the NESCAC-kings of New England.&quot; In a country that is independent 
        yet still allows its highest court to be controlled by the British, Blake 
        may want to rethink his statements of royalty, even though the pretty 
        purple color of the Ephs' uniforms would surely look super on the flowing 
        robe of a king.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This is not a pot (paying homage to Bob Marley) shot at Blake's native 
        country. Jamaica is surely a beautiful place. And who doesn't like the 
        feel-good film Cool Runnings, the story of the Jamaican bobsled team's 
        improbable winter Olympic showing? </p>
      <p align="left">
        Still, as with the Jamaican bobsledders in the 1988 Calgary games, Williams 
        may be setting themselves up for a crash ending to their season. By overlooking 
        a tough, competitive Middlebury team, Alex Blake and the Ephs might just 
        find themselves watching as the Panthers take on the winner of the Amherst/Bowdoin 
        game. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And if both Williams and Bowdoin get through their first round matches, 
        you can be guaranteed fireworks on Sunday, as there is no love loss between 
        the players or coaches of these two teams.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Blake might want to take a cue from McMann on how to properly deal with 
        the media. Said McMann, &quot;One must approach each game in a professional 
        manner believing that he will win his battle out on the field.&quot; This 
        is a testament to both McMann and the team he, along with Fuller and Folan, 
        leads, as this modest statement was made far before Blake's comments were 
        posted. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If both Williams and Bowdoin are fortunate enough to get through their 
        semi-final games, look for McMann and the Polar Bears to give Blake and 
        the Ephs a free Sunday lesson regarding the main points of Humility 101. 
        The final exam for these self-proclaimed &quot;kings of the NESCAC&quot; 
        will cover the finer points of how to observe as a team with true dignity 
        and a fine leader at the helm carry the NESCAC championship trophy across 
        the same field that Blake had hoped to &quot;beat Bowdoin's [butt]&quot; 
        on.</p>
