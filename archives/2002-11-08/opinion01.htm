        <font size="2">JAMES BAUMBERGER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Democratic losses in the midterm congressional elections 
        were somewhat surprising, yet not entirely unpredictable. The Democrats 
        could not simultaneously distinguish themselves from their Republican 
        challengers and avoid a shift too far to the left of a popular president.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush campaigned more than any sitting president ever has for a midterm 
        election. It was a gutsy move. By making himself so visible, he set himself 
        up for a potentially damaging political defeat. He made a wise choice 
        though, one that netted Republicans control of both the House and the 
        Senate in Tuesday's election.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dubbed &quot;historic&quot; by the White House, this election was indeed 
        a political anomaly. Not since the time of Franklin Roosevelt has a first-term 
        president's party picked up House seats in a midterm election.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush simply made the election about himself. Since the 9/11 terrorist 
        attacks, Bush's approval rating has been astronomically high. Currently 
        in the upper 60 percent range, his public support is unprecedented for 
        a president two years into his term. He stumped for Republican candidates 
        in 40 states, encouraging voters to &quot;Win one for George Dubya!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        His campaigning worked. Bucking the trend, the Republicans not only kept 
        the House, but even gained seats. The Democrats lost two seats in the 
        Senate (pending a possible recount in South Dakota and a runoff election 
        in Louisiana) and will relinquish control of the body, giving Bush a majority 
        in both houses of Congress.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While most pundits expected the Democrats to hold onto the Senate, this 
        analysis was probably based more on historical trends than the current 
        political environment. In the midst of national unity behind a popular 
        president waging a war against terrorism, the Democrats could hardly have 
        expected to come out better than they did.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The voters resonated with the Republicans on national defense, largely 
        because Bush has been the center of the popular War on Terrorism. In Georgia, 
        successful Republican challenger Saxby Chambliss defeated incumbent Democratic 
        Senator Max Cleland by portraying his opponent as uninterested in homeland 
        security. Cleland, by the way, lost three limbs serving his country in 
        the Vietnam War.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Democrats could not convince the voters that the economic downturn 
        was the fault of the Bush administration. The economy was the number one 
        concern of Americans going into the election and the Democrats failed 
        to capitalize on their distress.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But what where they to do? </p>
      <p align="left">
        Come out with an economic package that would have included a repeal of 
        Bush's tax cut? While probably the right thing to do, this would have 
        been just as politically unwise as hoping the economy would backfire on 
        Bush. Without any strong issues of their own, the Democrats allowed this 
        election come down to Bush and his agenda.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many of the Democrats in the closest races voted with Bush on the tax 
        cut and Iraq, further complicating their reelection situation. Again, 
        these Democrats were trying to navigate between two bad situations: either 
        coming off as too liberal or appearing indistinguishable from their Republican 
        challengers.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Under the circumstances, the Democrats did not do all that badly. After 
        all, they were stuck with a set of impossible choices.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking to the future, the Democrats did pick up several governorships, 
        which will surely help in the 2004 presidential election.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush's support, stemming largely from international issues, will now translate 
        into domestic power. This will be a painful two years for Democrats as 
        they watch Bush make his irresponsible tax cut permanent, wage a war in 
        Iraq, and fill the Federal judiciary with conservative judges who could 
        possibly overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
