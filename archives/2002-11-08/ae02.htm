      <p align="left"><i>A Servant of Two Masters</i>, written by Carlo Goldoni 
        in the Eighteenth century, fits right into the colorful 1930s Venetian 
        movie set that fills the stage. Although language and nuance may change 
        a bit with time, the essence of what is funny never will. Clever slaves, 
        silly masters, multiple love intrigues, the promise of a happy ending-in 
        short, the defining factors of comedy-will always conjure up laughs.</p>

      <p align="left">The director of the play, theater professor Davis Robinson, 
        noted that comedic &quot;[comedic] situations are immortal.&quot; Goldoni's 
        comedia, one of the few that was written down during his time, stemmed 
        from an art form that thrived on pure improvisation. The actors &quot;had 
        a page or two of plot,&quot; but besides that, they pretty much winged 
        it up on stage, depending on their wit and their involvement in the dilemmas 
        of the characters to carry them through. Comedia was performed in the 
        market place, and usually starred stock characters of the new comedy genre; 
        characters that were well-known and well-loved by all audience members.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The actors in this production deliver lines from Goldoni's script but 
        simultaneously must try to mimic the improvisational vigor of the original 
        Comedia. &quot;While performing comedy,&quot; said Robinson, &quot;you 
        get a sense that you are always improvising.&quot; Actors must react to 
        the moment, to the audience, and to other actors on stage. &quot;The lines 
        are not brilliant gems. It's all about how they're spun. Comedy is a constant 
        quest for spontaneity. It makes people laugh because it is in the moment-it 
        is real.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Not only does the director know what audiences want, the actors do also. 
        Michael Wood '06 plays the part of the clever slave, Truffaldino, to perfection. 
        Ellen Powers '06 is scrumptiously ditsy as the lover Clarice. Marcus Pearson 
        '05 runs around the stage with a sword stuck in his pants as Silvio, Clarice's 
        goofy counterpart. Most importantly, however, none of the actors are playing 
        to be funny. They inhabit their parts and, by doing so, they cannot help 
        but be risible. &quot;As long as actors are focusing on the situations 
        and aren't trying to be funny, they will be funny,&quot; commented Robinson. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The players must truly appear to believe in the importance of their dilemmas 
        for the comedic effects of the play to fall into place. Indeed, this production 
        hits the mark. Even though the plot is predictable, the audience is kept 
        in enough suspence to remain intrigued by the action unfolding on stage. 
        Will Beatrice's true identity be discovered? Will Clarice end up with 
        Silvio? Will the clever slave, Truffaldino, get rewarded despite his trickery 
        and tomfoolery? It is comedy-the answer, of course, must be yes, yes, 
        and yes. But the pleasure derived from accompanying the characters through 
        difficulties that will surely be resolved in everyone's favor is unbeatable. 
        That is the charm of comedy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The version of the play being performed is relatively new, having been 
        written by Tom Cone for a performance in 1980 at the Stratford Festival 
        in Canada. Robinson, however, tried to give the production a hint of the 
        Marx Brothers, a dash of Laurel and Hardy, and the kind of artificiality 
        that was practically a trademark of the 1930s comedy movie genre. Besides 
        the performers, it was also clear that those behind the scenes had gotten 
        into the heady aspects of comedy. Crew member extraordinaire Adrienne 
        Heflich '05 noted that &quot;there is humor in every aspect of the production: 
        even the props get a chuckle.&quot; In short, if you miss seeing this 
        production, you'll be missing a chance at experiencing a seamless comedy-in 
        terms of acting, props, and scenery.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>A Servant of Two Masters</i> will be playing November 
        7, 8, and 9 at 8:00 p.m. in Pickard Theater. The Production is being sponsored 
        by the Department of Theater and Dance of Bowdoin College.</p>
