      <p align="left">Pop quiz: What do Tiger Woods and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have 
        in common?</p>
      <p align="left">
        (A) Both revolutionized their respective sports.<br>
        (B) Both dominated like no other athletes before them.<br>
        (C) Both were black men.<br>
        (D) The rules of the game changed in an attempt to limit their influence.<br>
        (E) All of the above.</p>
      <p>The correct answer is (E). Although Abdul-Jabbar starred as a rookie 
        in the NBA in 1970 and Tiger Woods entered the PGA in 1996, their early 
        careers have been, in part, defined by a powerful force: institutional 
        racism.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Before Kareem dazzled the NBA with the skyhook, he was known as Lew Alcindor, 
        a talented 7'1&quot; center at UCLA who dunked at will. In his first game 
        as a collegiate athlete, he dropped in 61 points against Washington State's 
        man-to-man defense. He then led the Bruins to the first of three straight 
        national championships.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, after Alcindor's sophomore season in 1967, the NCAA banned the 
        dunk-a regulation that lasted until 1976.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alexander Wolff, a staff writer for Sports Illustrated, explains the ban 
        in his book entitled Basketball: A History of the Game: &quot;Many people 
        considered the rule the last desperate act of a grounded majority frustrated 
        at watching basketball become an increasingly high-wire, black game.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While NCAA basketball argued that the new rule would limit injuries and 
        protect equipment, Wolff notes that it was &quot;probably also to limit 
        the incipient dominance of 7'1&quot; UCLA center Lew Alcindor.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unable to take advantage of his dunking ability, Alcindor improved his 
        all-around game and perfected his famous skyhook. The NCAA's racially 
        motivated rule change backfired, as Alcindor raised the bar and increased 
        his dominance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Three decades later, another sport is supposedly being threatened by the 
        ascendancy of a black athlete who is redefining the game. The sport is 
        golf, his name is Tiger Woods, and the PGA is employing strategies to 
        curb his dominance-just like the NCAA did to Alcindor in 1967. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The trademark courses of the Professional Golf Association, including 
        the fabled Augusta National Country Club, are in the midst of being &quot;Tiger-proofed.&quot; 
        Golf purists argue that Woods' unparalleled length and accuracy off the 
        tee changes the way the game is supposed to be played. Although they are 
        too politically correct to admit it, they feel pressured by a black man's 
        rise to stardom in professional golf.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After winning his first of two green jackets at the Masters played at 
        Augusta, course officials and members decided that the course was too 
        short. Due to his uncanny ability to control long irons and place his 
        long drives consistently on the fairway, Tiger was simply dominating the 
        tournament. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1997, Woods shot a course-record 18 under par to earn a 12-shot victory. 
        In 2001, he again humbled his opponents by recording a two-stroke victory 
        with a 16 under par aggregate.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In an attempt to neutralize Tiger's advantage off the tee, Augusta lengthened 
        nine holes in 2001, adding a total of 285 yards to the course. Despite 
        this attempt at Tiger-proofing, Woods recorded his third Masters title 
        in 2002, becoming the second youngest player to win the tournament three 
        times. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Woods' ascendancy and the course changes are not coincidental events for 
        the exclusive country club.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although the first Masters took place in 1934, a black golfer did not 
        play in the tournament until 1974, and a black man was not allowed membership 
        until 1990. In the year 2002, Augusta still refuses to extend membership 
        privileges to women. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Considering Augusta's reluctance to allow African Americans access to 
        the course-as well as their ongoing denial of women's rights-it doesn't 
        take a genius to realize that the traditionally racist and sexist club 
        would react negatively to Tiger's rise to stardom. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, like Alcindor, Woods' overall game continues to improve, and 
        his dominance permeates the sport despite Tiger-proofing. Every Major 
        tournament is his to lose-unless he falters, his competitors don't stand 
        a chance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At age 26, Tiger Woods has solidified his status as the greatest golfer 
        of his generation. To top it off, he's doing it all in a sport that has 
        traditionally barred minority access to the game. Not only has he broken 
        through a racial divide, he's the world's number-one ranked player.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Decades later, history has repeated itself. Only today, we don't call 
        it &quot;racism.&quot; We call it &quot;Tiger-proofing.&quot;</p>
