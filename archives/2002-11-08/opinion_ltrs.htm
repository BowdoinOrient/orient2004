      <p align="left"> To the Community:</p>
      <p>Around the world, billions of people are plagued by hunger and poverty. 
        One in five live on less than one dollar a day. Over a billion lack access 
        to safe water, sanitation, and shelter. What's more, poverty can not be 
        compartmentalized as a problem for developing countries only. In the United 
        States, 32.2 million people, about 12 percent of the population, live 
        below the poverty line. Hunger plagues 31 million U.S. citizens and vast 
        numbers do not have access to adequate healthcare.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On Wednesday, November 13, 2002, Bowdoin students, faculty, and staff, 
        along with members of the Brunswick community, will join nearly a million 
        others around the country who are participating in Oxfam America's Fast 
        for a World Harvest campaign to help fight poverty and hunger around the 
        world. The event is a Hunger Banquet, a dramatization of the unequal distribution 
        of resources and wealth in the world. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Each guest at the Hunger Banquet will be randomly assigned a low-, middle-, 
        or high- income tier and will be served a corresponding meal. The Banquet 
        also includes speakers like Professor Jonathan White, the founding director 
        of Sports for Hunger, and a program that brings to life the inequities 
        of our world and challenges participants to realize how our decisions 
        affect others in the world. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Banquet costs one dollar for students with transferable board and 
        five dollars for non-students and students without board. Further, several 
        local businesses have donated services and goods for a raffle. Raffle 
        tickets are one dollar each. The funds raised from the Banquet and the 
        raffle will all go to Oxfam America's hunger- and poverty-relief programs 
        in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and the Americas, including the United 
        States. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Poverty is not inevitable. It is the result of the denial of such opportunities 
        as education, economic options, and participatory government. For more 
        information on what we can do, or for tickets for the Hunger Banquet or 
        raffle, stop by the Global Help table in Smith Union or email Molly (mfarneth) 
        or Debbie (dwissel).</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I write in response to a letter in last week's Orient and to clarify 
        that my opinions reach far beyond grieving over increased grade competition. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        I am indeed upset that student opinion was not given greater consideration 
        in changing the grading system, and I doubtlessly believe that grade competition 
        will increase. What bothers me most, however, is that our new system, 
        at least on paper (and, in my opinion, in reality), has changed the tone, 
        focus and mission of Bowdoin College.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In over three years of college, it has become quite apparent that work 
        for and inside the classroom comprises a small percentage what it takes 
        to round and improve our lives. The new grading system can do nothing 
        but increase student focus on our studies, which must come at the expense 
        of enhancing our lives. This change in the spirit of the student body 
        will arrive (or has arrived) simultaneously with a change in the spirit 
        of Bowdoin as a whole. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I do not agree that our task as students is &quot;to relentlessly pursue 
        academic excellence,&quot; but rather, to use our time and resources to 
        become better, fuller people, an endeavor which extends far beyond the 
        confines of our curriculum. If choosing a college means nothing more than 
        choosing a place to pursue academic excellence, what distinguishes Bowdoin 
        from anywhere else? </p>
      <p align="left">
        Two years ago, I might have agreed with your willingness to accept such 
        a change. But having gained a more intimate knowledge of Bowdoin's essence 
        and it's significance to my life, I choose to continue to &quot;beat this 
        horse&quot; while I yearn and plead for the message and spirit of our 
        system of old. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So yes, I am distressed that our voices have gone unheard, but even further 
        distressed by your call for passivity and silence. What once made Bowdoin 
        uniquely great was the school's apparent understanding that the realities 
        and truths of life cannot be uncovered solely through our studies, and 
        that we should worry less about how much room we have for improvement 
        on paper and more about actually improving ourselves as people. More than 
        anything, I guess, I'm distressed by the apathy and lack of ideals that 
        seem to lurk among us. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And for those who have chosen to float in between classes and the library, 
        concerned with little more than &quot;achieving their 'best' possible 
        work,&quot; why are you even here in the first place? I'm sure you'd fit 
        right in as another face in the crowd at any school as devoid of personality 
        as its diploma-hungry student body. </p>
      <p>Sincerely, </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Student digest acted fairly</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To The Editors,</p>
      <p>As the moderator of the Student Digest, I would like to respond to last 
        week's letter. The student digest is an important tool. According to the 
        digest itself, &quot;the student digest is a moderated daily bulletin 
        which includes notices and information relevant to the entire student 
        body.&quot; Each message is reviewed by the Chair of the Student Computing 
        Committee (the moderator) and either accepted or rejected based on its 
        content and formatting. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I would like to clear up a number of facts. The Bowdoin Women's Association 
        sent a message on October 20 to be included in the next days digest. The 
        original message spoke of a group with a mission, but did not include 
        information regarding where, when, and how people could participate; i.e., 
        no table information was included nor was any specific event announced. 
        The request was made by the moderator that the group simply include a 
        time and place of meeting.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A sample message was to the BWA to facilitate inclusion. Additionally, 
        the moderator offered to re-moderate the digest later that evening to 
        ensure the message would be included. Ultimately, the BWA violated the 
        Computer Use Policy by bypassing the Student Digest and sending their 
        message to the affiliate lists. The SCC received a number of student complaints 
        about this action, as some students found the message to be &quot;invasive&quot; 
        and &quot;inappropriate.&quot; A number of explanatory emails were exchanged, 
        and eventually the BWA sufficiently modified the message for it to be 
        included - basically, an event was announced.</p>
      <p align="left"> The original messages may be viewed at <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/%7Emcowger/">http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mcowger/</a>. 
        The moderator reviewed the message with several others, including college 
        staff, and concluded that the message needed to be modified. The allegation 
        of censorship is without merit, as a message did go out once it had proper 
        information attached. There was no desire to limit the freedom of speech; 
        there was only the intent to have all individuals follow the guidelines 
        that have been historically used by moderators throughout the years.</p>
      <p align="left">
        An active and involved community is in the best interest of all and therefore 
        the BWA was invited on October 1 to appoint a member to help the SCC review 
        these policies. To date, we have yet to receive a response of any kind. 
        As has already been stated, the SCC would love to hear student's ideas 
        and policy suggestions-we have a number of things on the burners and hope 
        to hear more of your ideas! You can contact us about this matter or any 
        other any time by emailing scc@bowdoin.edu.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Matt Cowger, Student Computing Committee Chair.</p>
