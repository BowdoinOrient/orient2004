        <font size="2">PAT ROCKEFELLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> If I read one more article about Bowdoin's political apathy 
        in the Orient, I am going to just stop caring all together. Even more 
        disturbing is a trend in the articles that says that for some reason it 
        is a good idea for students who are apathetic to &quot;get out there and 
        vote.&quot; </p>
      <p>Voting is not a cure for apathy. It is, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, 
        the silver frame around the golden apple that is civil engagement. Encouraging 
        the apathetic to vote is like giving Super Bowl tickets to someone who 
        has never even seen a football game before and really doesn't want to. 
        To make myself abundantly clear, I hope those of you who are politically 
        apathetic did not vote. </p>
      <p>This is not to bash the &quot;politically apathetic.&quot; If you are 
        apathetic, that is your business. I am sure you have your own interests-chemistry, 
        reading, sports, drinking heavily-and politics may not be one of them. 
        This is directed more towards the politically active who take it as their 
        sacred duty to ensure that all people vote, regardless of how much they 
        know or care.</p>
      <p>Current trends in informed political thinking say that voting is an unquantifiable 
        good in and of itself. Therefore, anything that can increase the number 
        of people who vote is good. I cannot tell you how relieved I am that such 
        a large percentage of our population does not abide by this logic. </p>
      <p>We have come to see low turnout-especially among youth-as a national 
        tragedy, and representative of the failure of the system. We therefore 
        make efforts to get as many people to register and vote as possible. We 
        have, for example, Motor Voter Laws, Get out the Vote Drives, and most 
        disturbing of all MTV's Rock the Vote. </p>
      <p>If I were ever to endorse a ban on political speech it would be any political 
        speech coming from MTV. I do not say that lightly, as political speech 
        is perhaps the most important kind of free speech. I came to this conclusion, 
        however, when I saw MTV give its support in 2000 to Alan Keyes because 
        he stage-dived into a crowd of 20-year-olds to the tune of Rage Against 
        the Machine. If you are familiar with Alan Keyes, you will understand 
        why this was perhaps the single most awkward event that I have ever witnessed. 
      </p>
      <p>But why is it such a sin that those who do not care, and therefore do 
        not inform themselves, also do not vote? The logical conclusion regarding 
        low turnout is that most people are, on the whole, satisfied with the 
        way things are, and therefore do not feel that it is worth their time 
        to vote. This is anathema to the politically active, but no less true. 
      </p>
      <p>I saw a disturbing poll last election cycle that said most young people 
        get their news from late night talk shows. These are funny shows, but 
        the foundation of an educated populace they are not. One of the fears 
        of democracy was of the Tyranny of the Majority. Fortunately, due to low 
        turnout, we need not fear the Tyranny of the Morons as well.</p>
      <p>Voting is an important responsibility, and as such should be done by 
        people who take political issues seriously. Voting for the sake of voting 
        does not enrich our Republic, but diminishes it. Soon, with the advent 
        of the internet, we will no doubt see online voting, so people can vote 
        at home in their underwear between checking email and reading The Onion. 
        And a beautiful day for democracy and freedom that will be. </p>
      <p>Unlike what your parents said about driving a car, voting is a right, 
        not a privilege, and so it should be taken very seriously. That said, 
        all rights come with responsibilities. In the case of voting the responsibility 
        is to be informed about who and what you are voting for and against. If 
        you are too apathetic to do that, fine. But I hope you stayed home on 
        Tuesday.</p>
