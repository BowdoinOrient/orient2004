      <p align="left">In the twilight darkness the attackers moved swiftly into 
        position. They knew the trees, the roads, the scattered buildings and 
        for a full year now, they had been waiting for this opportunity. In early 
        October, when the chill of autumn has not yet descended and the warmth 
        of summer is all but passed, there is a stillness in the air that lingers 
        in the breeze and hovers amongst the trees. On this night-the night of 
        decision and action-the sleek armed bodies moved between this pre-fall 
        weather and bore down onto the open field where, from yards away, they 
        could clearly see the easy prey that had assembled there. The first attackers 
        saw the mingling men-men who were new and uncertain as to what was happening 
        yet still dangerous for they sensed the danger that was in the air. Whether 
        they were stupid or courageous, or just plain excited, no one can really 
        tell, for a man in motion, on the attack, exercising the primal human 
        urge to hunt, is a formidable animal under any circumstances. Yet something 
        restrained the first attackers on the field. They, who had waited so long 
        for this moment, halted and aligned, checked their armaments, got into 
        line, and all at once, with a mad screaming yell, charged.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The freshmen did not know what to think. In the dark, on the field beside 
        Bowdoin's newly commissioned Pickard Field House, they were suddenly surrounded 
        by yelling men with large quantities of stinking molasses. As the foul-smelling 
        projectiles began to fly through the air, the two forces-the defending 
        freshmen and the attacking sophomores-collided. But there was no anger 
        in the air; instead there was terror, excitement, shock, and humor. Most 
        of all, however, there was the great sense of accomplishment for both 
        sides-this, after all, was tradition. It was called &quot;Proc Night&quot; 
        when the two opposing classes met in mock battle. The freshmen-the Class 
        of 1941-had started it this year by yelling insults at their upperclassman 
        brothers. The sophomores, their archenemies, in the meantime, had been 
        preparing for their late-night offensive at Whittier Field. The molasses 
        was also tradition but woe to whomever was responsible for cleaning up 
        the mess in the morning. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This was a rite of passage for the young men of Bowdoin in those years 
        before the coming of the Second World War. Many traditions were observed 
        and &quot;Proc Night&quot; was one of the first. For the freshmen, their 
        first year would be one of humiliation and frustration-something that 
        the College probably did not advertise when it sought to sell its old 
        boys' school image to future students. For the sophomores, this was their 
        chance to give back to their young brothers what the class before them 
        had done. It was a part of becoming a Bowdoin man; it was part of the 
        hazing tradition; but more importantly, according to an editorial in the 
        Bowdoin Orient, &quot;hazing is entertaining sport&quot; and &quot;hazing 
        is fun.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Following the molasses bombardment the two classes began to strip each 
        other-another fine male bonding experience. This last activity, however, 
        quickly ended the festivities before the stroke of midnight. Freshmen 
        and sophomores returned to their dorms on the Quad, via the Harpswell 
        Road, or other paths towards the center of campus. Perhaps that reminder 
        of winter air finally settled upon them as they retired towards their 
        warm dorms and un-torn cloths.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Class of 1941 was the largest in Bowdoin's history up to that time. 
        204 freshmen from 15 states joined the College in the fall of 1937. The 
        fraternity system went to work immediately to recruit the youngsters; 
        they received, in total, 179 pledges. The new students came from all walks 
        of life and from all corners of the United States, with a majority coming 
        from Massachusetts and 32 being sons of former Bowdoin men. The American 
        experience up to that point in history was based greatly upon tradition. 
        Among those traditions was to send their children to their parents' alma 
        mater. When asked why he had chosen to attend Bowdoin College, Professor 
        of Physics Emeritus Elroy O. LaCasce '44 commented simply, &quot;I was 
        sent here!&quot; Indeed, the lyrics of the ever-popular &quot;Bowdoin 
        Beta&quot; include the verse:</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>When manhood has found us,<br>
        And children surround us,<br>
        Our college days and friends we'll still recall.<br>
        With heartfelt emotions and deathless devotion,<br>
        We'll send our sons to Bowdoin in the Fall.</i></p>
      <p align="left">
        When the new sons of Bowdoin appeared on campus and filed into the first 
        year brick dorms to begin their college days, they were met with a thriving 
        campus, smug, strong, tenacious, and always independently minded. Here 
        was the campus that had seen many generations of Bowdoin men-men who had 
        stood up to the rigid rules and military discipline of President Joshua 
        Chamberlain; men who had shoved the memorial flagpole into the Chapel 
        as a sign of protest to the administration's plans of placing it in the 
        center of the Quad. These rebellious activities, however, were sometimes 
        without cause and were merely pranks at the expense of the College. In 
        January 1938, a few of these pranksters got into the Chapel's bell tower 
        and cut the rope, disabling the bell. The Sills administration was good 
        humored about such happenings; Dean of the College, Paul Nixon laughed 
        off the incident by noting on his bulletin board a day later: &quot;cutting 
        it [the bell rope] is always good for a laugh&quot; but cautioned &quot;don't 
        monkey with the bell itself, boys. The last time that was done, the clapper, 
        or something, fell out and just missed hitting the man below.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        That year administration restarted a custom that had been retired for 
        three decades: the signing of the matriculation book. In the ceremony 
        the first years were personally greeted by President Sills before signing 
        their names in the book which was last used in 1856 for this sort of event. 
        Having completed this task, they were now bound to the College and it 
        was a bond that many would cherish for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Whether these young men would be as wild and as bold as previous generations 
        was yet to be determined. There was still much to learn and many more 
        traditions to attend to; among them was one that was the major event of 
        every fall week in the 1930s and 40s: football. Bowdoin started the football 
        season in 1937 with a strong game, crushing Massachusetts State by 12-0. 
        Leading the famed Polar Bears was football master Adam Walsh, a member 
        of the College community since the mid-1930s. Under his guiding hand, 
        the Polar Bears had a remarkable season, besting Wesleyan 13-0 in October 
        and beating Colby 30-0 in the same month. Football matches drew huge crowds 
        as students, faculty, and alumni met to cheer on Walsh's Polar Bears.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were other sports too and while none of them had the allure of football, 
        one of them did have a coach who was as equally as impressive as Adam 
        Walsh: the track team's John &quot;Jack&quot; Magee. In 1938 Magee celebrated 
        his twenty-fifth year coaching at Bowdoin. In that time he trained some 
        of the College's finest athletes and earned the friendship of hundreds 
        of students and administrators. Besides Walsh and Magee in athletics, 
        there were also others like the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet and English 
        professor Robert Peter Tristram Coffin (Bowdoin Class of 1915), Professor 
        of English and Director of Dramatics George H. &quot;Pat&quot; Quinby 
        (Bowdoin Class of 1923) whose interests included travel, football, and 
        who was known as a master fencer. There was also the French instructor 
        Arthur Gilligan who told his students, &quot;Gentlemen, you're not going 
        to like me, very few people do, but you're going to learn French!&quot; 
        Professor of Psychology Charles Theodore Burnett, History Professor Nathaniel 
        Cooper Kendrick, and then there were the two masters of the Classics Department, 
        the President and the Dean of the College, Kenneth Charles Morton Sills 
        and Paul Nixon. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These were the men that the students would get to know, learn from, and 
        respect. The resources of the College were also available to the undergraduates. 
        Hubbard Hall's library stacks contained almost 200,000 books. Its collections 
        were under the care of librarian Gerald G. Wilder and it included among 
        its recent possessions the manuscript collections of former U.S. president 
        Franklin Pierce (Bowdoin Class of 1823), and literary legends Nathaniel 
        Hawthorne, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (both of the Class of 1825). 
        An editorial in the Orient noted that few first years were aware of this 
        facility and resource, estimating that not more than a sixth of the student 
        body frequented the stacks. This was a problem and should be rectified, 
        the editorial continued, noting that Hubbard was &quot;the heart of the 
        college&quot;.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Amidst the classes, the sports practices, and daily Chapel events, the 
        freshmen were kept busy. Their lives continued to be complicated by their 
        upper-class associates. In late October, the hazing continued with what 
        was known as &quot;Hell Week&quot;-a series of events whereby each fraternity 
        decided how to humiliate their first-year brothers. In the Fall of 1937 
        there were various activities: different houses had first-year plays, 
        the Sigma Nu members dressed up like tin soldiers while the Zetes had 
        their freshmen carry goldfish aquariums around campus (unfortunately for 
        the fish, little care was observed and many ended up dead in their moving 
        containers). According to the Orient, &quot;new ways of eating&quot; were 
        invented as fraternity feasts went without silverware and &quot;The A. 
        T. O.'s can attest to the fact that eating spaghetti held behind their 
        backs is rather inconvenient. &#133; The Beta's are quite willing to refuse 
        raw eggs the next time they are offered them; they contend also that steak 
        is much better than dry bread and peppery soup.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As these fraternal and traditional bonding rituals continued amongst the 
        students, the College administration was looking on with grave concern. 
        Kenneth Charles Morton Sills, who had seen the horror of a campus during 
        wartime twenty years earlier, felt uneasy. While he had lived with the 
        College's tradition of hazing for most of his life, he felt that its practices 
        were quickly becoming obsolete. Sills also realized early on that there 
        was trouble in the world, the likes of which had never before been witnessed. 
        In Germany, thousands of miles away, Adolph Hitler had been appointed 
        chancellor in 1933 and continued his meteoric rise through coercion and 
        violence. New laws had been created to suppress Jews and other minorities 
        while the German army and navy began to grow again despite the Treaty 
        of Versailles' limitations on its armed forces. Elsewhere, in the Far 
        East the Japanese Imperial armies were massing for a strike against Nanking 
        and continuing their conquest of Mainland China. An incident on the Yangtze 
        River may have alarmed the President even further when the U.S. gunship 
        Panay was sunk by Japanese bombers in December of 1937. The peace that 
        had been bought with millions of lives not more than two decades earlier 
        was quickly falling apart. Even before the Panay's sinking, Sills had 
        been troubled by world events and warned his students in the year's opening 
        Chapel:</p>
      <p align="left">
        No sober minded person can look abroad at the present moment without realizing 
        how deep-seated is the lawlessness of the times. From countries where 
        crime has been prevalent the disregard of law has spread to nations dealing 
        with one another. It is no exaggeration to assert that on at least three 
        continents international gunmen are at work. If the civilized nations 
        of the world cannot by persuasion or power control this lawlessness, civilization 
        itself is in very gravedanger [sic]. You may ask what this all has to 
        do with us. But it seems to a good many of us clear that if during the 
        period of youth there is no respect for law and reasonable order, it is 
        going to be hard for later generations to insist on the value of law and 
        order and their relations one with another. Here at Bowdoin we have very 
        few rules and regulations; it is sometimes said that there are no rules 
        until you break them; but if in your college course you do not learn the 
        great social lesson of abiding by reasonable restrictions and obeying 
        reasonable regulations, you are going yourself to contribute to the general 
        lawlessness of the times.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While lack of awareness in world affairs was one of the reasons that Sills 
        was troubled, there was also the issue of hazing itself that he did not 
        entirely agree with. &quot;To some degree or other we are all of us hypocrites,&quot; 
        the President declared at a Sunday Chapel in December 1937. There were 
        elements in the College, he went on, which decried the despotism of other 
        nations but continued to tolerate racial prejudice and fraternal abuses 
        at home. &quot;You believe in racial tolerance, in social services, in 
        honesty, in working for peach and against war-of course,&quot; the President 
        added, &quot;But are you willing to pay the price if such a position actually 
        costs you something?&quot; Sills continued to hammer at this point throughout 
        the year. Calling the hazing spirit &quot;the kid brother of the militaristic 
        spirit&quot; the President listed his objections to the fraternity system, 
        hinting at its hierarchical spirit: &quot;We sometimes hear that claim 
        made that our college is one of the most democratic in the country. I 
        hope that we can justify that claim. But hazing is not democratic; exclusion 
        is not democratic&#133;&quot; This last comment was likely aimed at the 
        exclusion of African-Americans and Jewish students from fraternities. 
        It was with this spirit of democracy and fairness in mind that Sills helped 
        students in forming &quot;the Thorndike Club&quot; for non-fraternity 
        men. While Bowdoin of the 1930s and 40s was a homogenous community, there 
        were those who were not welcome into fraternities, which had in their 
        charters, expressly stated that their members should be Christians only.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Orient weighed in on the issue early in 1938. Opposed to the recklessness 
        and irresponsible behavior of many students during &quot;Rising Day&quot;-a 
        day in spring when freshmen &quot;rise&quot; against their long time tormentors-the 
        College's newspaper placed part of the blame on the administration, which 
        it accused of &quot;encouraging&quot; vandalism and hazing &quot;by refusing 
        to abolish&quot; the activities. &quot;Tradition&quot;, the Orient continued, 
        &quot;has a stronger hold on the average Bowdoin underclassman than sentiment 
        and respect for hallowed college property.&quot; Despite these attacks 
        against their system and practices, the fraternities continued their activities 
        long into the future-albeit later on at a smaller scale. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many students probably questioned the President's attack on their way 
        of life but they also probably understood what concerned him in these 
        times of uncertainty. While house parties and gala events lighted up the 
        Maine nights on Bowdoin's campus, there was trouble in the wind from across 
        the seas and the continents. Those sons who did not remember the outside 
        world were given a taste of it when, on November 11, 1937, as part of 
        the College's long standing tradition, the members of the different classes 
        gathered solemnly in the Chapel. Casey Sills rose as the doors closed, 
        walked swiftly to the podium as he had done for decades, looked upon the 
        innocent young faces before him, led them in song, and began to read the 
        long roll of names-the names of Bowdoin's sons, his own friends and students, 
        who had, in the previous world war, sacrificed their lives in the name 
        of freedom and democracy. &quot;Warren Eastman Robinson, Harold Sumner 
        Small, Roland Hiram Waitt&#133;&quot; Two minutes of silence ended the 
        proceedings. As the students filed out to go to class or onto their various 
        activities Sills must have wondered for a split second about how many 
        of these young men, this generation, would have to go to war and how many 
        of them would pay the ultimate price in the end.</p>

        Those days of suffering and separation, however, were in the future-not 
        far in the future but in the future nonetheless. In the meantime there 
        was still the busy business of living. Bowdoin played host to its annual 
        house parties that cold Maine winter by inviting to campus some of the 
        prettiest girls on the eastern seaboards. Along to provide entertainment 
        was Artie Shaw and his band. As the undergraduates danced and celebrated 
        life in the chilly night there was happiness and enthusiasm in the air. 
        In the town of Brunswick there was also celebration that Christmas season 
        as Bowdoin fraternities donated $140 for holiday dinners and gifts-feeding 
        up to 230 Brunswick citizens. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For the Class of 1941, the daily routine of Bowdoin life slowly became 
        habit. They went to Chapel, they went to classes, ate in the Moulton Union, 
        served at the whim of their upper-class brothers, debated issues, practiced 
        sports, and generally tried to enjoy their time at Bowdoin. In many ways 
        life was simpler and easier. Rail communications with Boston and Portland 
        were established and the railroad station was a quick walk away. Laundry 
        was even easier; all a student had to do (if he lived within a few states 
        of Maine) was to drop his dirty cloths in a basket, send it down by rail 
        to his parents and wait for it to be returned. So successful was this 
        operation that the Railway Express could afford to print an ad, complete 
        with photograph, in the student paper. &quot;Whether it's send collect 
        or prepaid&quot; the ad read, &quot;your laundry always arrives quickly, 
        safely, by Railway Express-the favorite laundry route of generations of 
        college men and women.&quot; Young Everett Parker Pope from North Quincy, 
        Massachusetts, a member of the Class of 1941, was one such individual 
        who enjoyed this service. &quot;We used to send [the laundry] home to 
        my mother and that had some advantages,&quot; he remembers-these advantages 
        being brownies or other such treats in the laundry basket when it returned.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The young men of Bowdoin could thus concentrate on their work and fun. 
        In the spring of 1938, almost a year after the Class of 1941 had come 
        to the campus, they began to try out for Walsh's Polar Bear Football team. 
        84 reported to the coach, including a handsome fullback named Andrew Haldane. 
        As the flowers began to bloom, the freshmen rose to fight once more with 
        their tormentors, the sophomores, in a frenzy of rotten fruit and spraying 
        water. The Orient proclaimed it &quot;one of the wildest, fruit slingin' 
        water dousin', panel breakin', clothes strippin' scraps that has met the 
        eyes of Bowdoin men in several years.&quot; With these fights and other 
        dreaded events-such as finals-the academic year ended in June of 1938. 
        The seniors graduated into an uncertain world, still trying to disbelieve 
        the obvious truth that another war was swiftly coming. In China the Japanese 
        armies entered, destroyed, and massacred thousands of innocent civilians 
        in what was known as the Rape of Nanking. In Europe indecision amongst 
        the allied powers aided rather than prevented Hitler's armies from marching 
        into Austria and uniting it with the growing German nation. Be aware of 
        international events, Sills warned graduates and returning students alike: 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you think the question of international affairs has nothing to do with 
        you, go out someday and read the names of your older brothers inscribed 
        on the memorial flagstaff. A score of years ago or so, the undergraduates 
        of Bowdoin did not think what was happening in Europe was any concern 
        of theirs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The generation that Sills alluded to in his speech were on campus later 
        that year. Members of the Class of 1912, feeling that they should give 
        something back to their alma mater returned to donate a 20-ton Westerly 
        White granite polar bear statue. Sculpted by the famed F. G. R. Roth of 
        New Jersey-the same man who created Columbia University's Lion and Princeton 
        University's Tigers-the 11 foot monument was a gift and as Henry A. Shorey, 
        a member of the Class of 1941 and Orient correspondent put it, &quot;The 
        doners hope, of course, that Bowdoin men past, present, and future will 
        take the Bear to their hearts and look upon it as a definite expression 
        to them of much that Bowdoin means.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The members of the Class of 1941 survived their first year virtually intact. 
        They were no longer the youngest members of the College community and 
        thus with their embarrassing and fond memories of their first years behind 
        them, they went on vacation, knowing that their best moments at Bowdoin 
        College were yet to come.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Elsewhere, men and tanks were moving and a depressed world crept ever 
        closer to full-scale war.</p>
