      <p align="left"> It's true that there are two sides to every story. Although 
        music provides endless enjoyment and pleasure for so many people, it is 
        certainly not an industry without its share of scary and sad events. In 
        fact, sometimes it seems that popular music has more than its share of 
        unfortunate circumstances, and the past decade has been no different. 
        This article will delve into and spotlight some (but certainly not all) 
        of the major downfalls of modern rock and roll.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We'll start with hashing over the music industry at large. We can't dismiss 
        Satan himself, a.k.a. Ticketmaster. I hate Ticketmaster. If anyone knows 
        what the &quot;convenience charge&quot; is for that TM happily slaps on 
        to our already ridiculously overpriced tickets, please let me know because 
        I certainly don't find it &quot;convenient&quot; to give them any more 
        money than they already suck out of me. They are what's making rock and 
        roll die; corporations are ruining our chances to see the shows that we 
        want to see. Who has $50 (or $75, or $100&#133;) to drop every time a 
        popular and fun band comes to town? Not me. So we dig into the bars and 
        clubs, not into the arenas and stadiums. Let's just hope TM doesn't get 
        claws of &quot;convenience charges&quot; into those places too.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I can't write an article talking about the devastations rock and roll 
        has faced in the recent past without talking about some things that are 
        much weightier than the usual substance of my column. One of these issues 
        is the untimely loss of Sublime. The Long Beach guys managed to make original 
        and beautiful music that has become popular-unfortunately not until after 
        Brad Nowell's death-in a time when original and beautiful music is sometimes 
        seen as too chancy in exec's eyes. 40 Oz. To Freedom is one of the greatest 
        albums ever recorded, and if you read this column then you know how hesitant 
        I am to glorify any band that has become famous within the last ten years. 
        Brad's death was a huge blow for the music world&#133;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &#133;As was the end of Kurt Cobain. Our parents talk to us about the 
        influential explosion known as the British Invasion; we're going to talk 
        to our kids about Nirvana.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Enough heaviness. Let's stop discussing music we wish could still be made 
        and talk music that we only wish would go away&#133;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Creed. There isn't even one thing to bitch about with these guys because 
        the entire package sucks. I'm glad they have found God and are comfortable 
        preaching about their faith, but leave me the hell alone. Whenever I hear 
        them I immediately think the end of the world is upon us. Then I realize, 
        &quot;oh, it's not Armageddon-IT'S EVEN WORSE.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The return of the boy band is equally sad. The difference between the 
        boy band of yesteryear (let's use the Monkees as an example) and the boy 
        band of today has to do with exposure. The only time you hear the Monkees 
        now is on the oldies station; in other words you have to voluntarily seek 
        them out. Unfortunately, we have to suffer through what I am sure plenty 
        of people did with the Monkees: facing the Backstreet Boys everywhere 
        you look-music, magazines, posters, TV, movies, lunch boxes, sheet sets?!&#133; 
        I have come close to O.D.ing on them on several occasions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        What's even worse than boy bands? The Billboard 2002 Music Awards lineup: 
        Avril Lavigne, Creed, Nelly, and Puddle Of Mudd. That is the most horrendous 
        excuse for an awards show lineup I have ever heard. I suppose it shouldn't 
        surprise me too much however; last year's big winners were R.Kelly, Destiny's 
        Child, and Tim McGraw. And the worst part of all? Creed has won Billboard's 
        &quot;Rock Artist of the Year&quot;&#133; twice. It's a sad, sad world. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        I'm really not a mean person. I honestly give credit to all of these artists 
        for achieving what everyone else wishes they could do: make a living being 
        a performing musician. I don't give them credit for being talented musicians, 
        but they are nonetheless still making a living from it. Despite my negative 
        tone, I'm sure there are plenty of great things happening in popular modern 
        music&#133; I just can't think of any.</p>
