      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the pines on the outskirts of the Bowdoin athletic 
        fields lies a forest that we all call the "Town Commons." This natural 
        haven has been here since the beginning of the College in 1794, and has 
        attracted thousands of students and local residents to walk its peaceful 
        paths or to run through the trails of its somber woods. Currently this 
        treasured place is threatened by development sprawl. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The trails extend three miles beyond Bowdoin College land 
        through the woods to the ocean, providing students with a great recreational 
        path for running, biking, cross-country skiing, bird-watching, and hiking. 
        The trail runs from campus to the water's edge at Middle Bay, and over 
        80% of the land along which the trail runs, is privately held by developers. 
        267 houses have been built within a mile of the Commons in the past twenty 
        years. It is important that Brunswick and Bowdoin act now to protect the 
        quality of this precious resource for the college students of today and 
        for generations to come. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The owners of this land have recently received increased 
        pressure to develop the land. Through the efforts of a group called FRIENDS 
        OF THE COMMONS, 112 acres of forest surrounding the Commons and including 
        the entire trail corridor are currently available for purchase by the 
        community. The purchase of this land would protect the existing trail 
        system from being developed. This would be wonderful for Bowdoin College 
        students who like to bike, cross-country ski, or run to the Commons. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon there will be students selling "Meals & Deals" coupons 
        in an effort to help this worthy cause. These coupons give an array of 
        bargains ranging from restaurant discounts to movie tickets in the Brunswick 
        area. Please help these students give to the future of Bowdoin College 
        by contributing. </p>
