      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Your recent editorial suggests that PETA's priorities are 
        askew, that animal activists shouldn't worry about the vicious, prime- 
        time stabbing death of a pig on Survivor because billions of animals endure 
        horrific conditions and cruelty on American factory farms. Please be assured 
        that PETA's tireless, decades-old vegetarian campaign has inspired countless 
        people to go vegetarian and vegan. Visit PETA's Web site, PETA.org, and 
        you'll learn that our undercover investigation of a factory farm resulted 
        in first-ever felony indictments for animal cruelty against farm workers 
        in North Carolina for hideous pig abuse. You'll find media releases announcing 
        our actions for animals raised for their flesh, including protests outside 
        a convention of pig exploiters and Burger Kings all over the country. 
        You'll realize America's meat addiction is cruel, unhealthy, and wreaking 
        havoc on our environment. You'll also find loads of vegetarian resources 
        and recipes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and our list of hundreds of cosmetics companies that 
        don't test their products on animals includes Mary Kay (we won that battle 
        years ago). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Why gripe about "the plight of one wild pig" on the game 
        show Survivor? Because it's wrong to exploit and kill animals for ratings. 
        Because there is suspicion that the pig was planted to give a bloodthirsty 
        contestant a "thrill kill," thereby titillating viewers with violence 
        (authorities are investigating the charge). Because the prime-time killing 
        sends a dangerous message to kids-that viciously stabbing an animal to 
        death is okay and that you'll make friends for it, all because an innocent 
        animal suffered and died. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What about the good samaritan who tries to stop individuals 
        from carelessly chucking personal trash on sidewalks? Would the Orient 
        suggest that his efforts are frivolous, given that a measly styrofoam 
        cup pales in comparison to pollution created by animal agricultural industries? 
        Should the parent of a bully not care that her kid is taunting his classmates 
        because other students are gunning their peers down? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; PETA says care about pollution, teenage violence, and corporate 
        cruelty to animals-and care about the Styrofoam cup, the kid, and the 
        "one wild pig." </p>
