      <p>The Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is on the subject of parking at Bowdoin. I live in 
        the Cleaveland Street Apartments, and I have a car for the first time 
        since I entered Bowdoin, and thankfully for the last. I have never been 
        treated with less respect or consideration than I experienced in dealing 
        with Security on this issue. We have only 7 or 8 spots for a building 
        that holds 14 people, mostly seniors. Consistently throughout the year, 
        faculty and staff members have been parking in our spots, and they never 
        get tickets.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; At one point last semester, I called Security every day for 
        a month to inform them of illegally parked faculty and staff cars, to 
        no avail. Just the other day, when there were no student spaces left, 
        I called them again. I couldn't park in the street, because it is only 
        two-hour parking, and I couldn't be there in two hours to move my car. 
        I have done it in the past and have received multiple tickets from the 
        Brunswick Police. So I parked in a faculty spot, of which there were at 
        least 4 or 5, and called Security to tell them, hoping to avoid receiving 
        a ticket. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; They say no; I can't part there. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I ask them where should I park? I am put on hold for a few 
        minutes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; No, I definitely can't park there.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I ask them where should I park? Again, they put me on hold 
        for 5 minutes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; They offer a few suggestions: Howell, Quinby, or Burnett. 
        So I go, move my car, and guess what? There are no free spots there, either. 
        By this time I was missing a lab. But who cares about academics as long 
        as I don't park somewhere I shouldn't, just because they are incompetent. 
        I have begged, pleaded, and talked to the assistant of security, and have 
        written to Res. Life and the director of Security. Every time, they very 
        politely tell me tough luck. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I know that there is limited parking, but the situation is 
        ridiculous. The College should be here for the students, but apparently 
        there are more important things to be considered. The least they could 
        do is reimburse me for the 25 dollars I have paid in parking tickets.</p>
