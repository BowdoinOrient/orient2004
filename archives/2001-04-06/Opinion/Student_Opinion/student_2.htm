      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I returned from Spring Break (spent right here in beautiful, 
        downtown Brunswick) to see a brand new addition to Thorne Dining. No, 
        I'm not talking about the new music selection (although I did hear some 
        Cranberries and Nickel Creek tonight at dinner), nor am I talking about 
        new mints in the shape of Presidental-Appointee Barry Mills's head. No, 
        the change that caught my eye was the new light fixtures hanging in the 
        main room.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You may have seen these keen, modern looking objects-dé-art 
        and wondered, "What the hell are those?" Well, I'm here to reassure you 
        that no one else has any idea, either, so don't feel too bad. Sure, the 
        "rock concert" ambience created by the ever-changing colors is a stark 
        contrast to the light fixtures themselves, which look as if they were 
        purchased at the Museum of Modern Art (just check out www.momastore.org 
        if you don't believe me), but you have to admit that this new lighting 
        system makes it a whole heck of a lot easier for us to see our food.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if you're sitting in the booths by the window, 
        which could be better lit with fifty scented candles from The Works, it 
        is still very difficult (read: "impossible") to see your food. I realize 
        that this "low lighting" is designed to create a more romantic ambience, 
        but even Brad Pitt looks goofy with food spilled down the front of his 
        shirt. It's also difficult to have a romantic conversation with the guy 
        or girl sitting across from you if you can't see his or her face. (Now 
        I realize that some people find anonymous sexual encounters in Thorne 
        Dining Centre exciting; if you're one of those people, I suggest that 
        you join Professor Potholm's "Conflict Simulation/Conflict Resolution" 
        class to discuss your non-normative sexual practices while simultaneously 
        researching the number of pornographic movies on the College's intranet.) 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have also heard a rumor that the College spent upwards 
        of $50,000 to pay for this lighting system; this begs the question, "Who 
        authorized that purchase?" I would have been glad to function as the College's 
        "Lighting Consultant" for $50,000 because, after a trip to Home Depot 
        for some Philips outdoor spotlights and a few colored gels, I could pocket 
        approximately $49,924.71. This $50,000 could also probably have been spent 
        doing renovations in the Tower (my wall is chipping as we speak) or providing 
        a few scholarship dollars to needy students. Just a thought.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In any case, I think that we should all start to enjoy - 
        not to question - this new menagerie of glass, plastic, and metal. I usually 
        go eat dinner at around 5:15pm but now, because of the time change, I'm 
        going to wait until it gets dark. I'll sit down at one of the long tables, 
        scrape my chair across the marred hardwood floor, and look up, admiring 
        the changing colors as my food sits, uneaten, on my tray.</p>
