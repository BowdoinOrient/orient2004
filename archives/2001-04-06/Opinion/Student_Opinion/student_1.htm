      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I like April Fools Day, well not if the biggest joke of 
        all is snowbanks and more classes. But still, it's a great chance to illicit 
        a fit of laughter, of course, at someone else's expense. But I realized 
        something this past Sunday, and it really had nothing to do with practical 
        jokes. Instead, the day reminded me just how much I hate really bad jokes. 
        You know the kind, the type the guy you are standing next to thinks are 
        the funniest things in the world, as you stand there barely able to break 
        a painful smile. I can hear them now: "So, two guys walk into a bar."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Jokes are schizophrenic, and hard to deliver. Good jokes 
        can leave your audience rolling around in laughter, while the mediocre 
        will leave people in your presence struggling to utter some sort of forced, 
        utterly fake, inevitably pathetic, laugh. And so, I find it interesting 
        the steps that someone will take to be polite, even to the worst joke 
        teller - even more interesting to realize the thought processes even I 
        myself will undergo when faced with a horrendous joke.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps before the extent to which a person will go to be 
        polite while struggling to laugh is explored, the scenario in which these 
        things occur should be explained. For some reason, unbeknownst to me, 
        it seems that when people are placed in social settings in which they 
        know not the company by which they are graced, they often deem it necessary 
        to whip out some lame jokes they heard ages ago, which often leave you 
        struggling to get the anachronous punch line. They feel as though a joke 
        will elevate their status amongst the group, making them the crowd favorite. 
        But what they fail to understand is that a bad joke can devastate first 
        impressions faster than they are even made. And so, spring break afforded 
        plenty of opportunities in which I was surrounded in company that of course, 
        I knew not, and inevitably, out came the lame jokes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I make faces. I know I do. I can't help it. And no, I'm not 
        good at hiding it, like so many people are. What I'm thinking is plastered 
        on my face, and if a joke isn't funny, well then, I'm just not smiling. 
        I'm sure my face contorted in a thousand ways this past break, as I was 
        presented with jokes that just didn't fall in the comic category. I knew 
        I really should be the polite audience that everyone else is, and in a 
        valiant effort I forced myself to smile, but this smile stemmed not from 
        laughter, but from nervousness. I hate being embarrassed for other people, 
        you know that feeling, when you feel so bad for the person you wish you 
        could help. So, I figured a smile is the best way to help. So there I 
        was, countless times, forcing a fake smile, all the while wishing I could 
        vaporize from the situation. And as far as laughing, forget that, it would 
        have sounded as if I was choking.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But, honestly, I love a good joke. I love to laugh. Often 
        times, I laugh at things that aren't even funny. And so, for a joke to 
        crash and burn in my presence, it needs to be lame - with a capitol L. 
        I think the remedy for bad joke tellers is for them to first recognize 
        that they are not funny, as often the people delivering these jokes feel 
        as though they are the funniest people on the face of the planet. Second 
        of all, they need to rebuild their arsenal of jokes, perhaps update to 
        the funny version. More importantly, all old, redundant jokes need to 
        be outlawed. No more chickens crossing the road, no more small pianists, 
        and no more bars. Originality is key in jokes, and often one-liners are 
        the best of them. There's nothing worse than listening to a long-winded 
        joke, and then not even laughing when the tirade is over. But most of 
        all, I feel that bad joke tellers need to realize that often the best 
        humor happens spontaneously, when things are not even intended to be funny. 
        This would at least ease the stress that all of us feel when we know we 
        should be laughing, and we just quite can't. There's nothing worse than 
        a silent audience after the jokester has just delivered the punch line. 
        But, ironically enough, that's what makes the situation comical - and 
        hey, maybe they'll get it: they're just not funny.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And oh, by the way, the third one ducked. </p>
