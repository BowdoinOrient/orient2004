      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 10 a.m. on Saturday, May 26th, Bowdoin College will 
        hold its 196th Commencement Exercises. This will be a time when students 
        of the class of 2001 celebrate Bowdoin by recalling their memories and 
        accomplishments during the past four years.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And, if we are to believe, the Commencement Weekend pamphlet 
        recently distributed by the College to graduating seniors and their families, 
        this is also a time when Bowdoin will be "celebrating [the] success and 
        bright futures" of its departing students.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; If we read further on in the Commencement schedule it is 
        clear that the College plans to waste no time in sending its students 
        forth into these "bright futures." The last event on the calendar, scheduled 
        for that very Saturday: "6:00 p.m. College Housing closes for all students."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After all, since "the Class of 2001 is an outstanding class," 
        surely its members will happily and easily be able to handle the task 
        of loading a year's worth of belongings into the car, on a day likely 
        to be among the busiest and most emotional of their young lives. Moreover, 
        who could imagine a better culmination to such a proud day than extended 
        heavy lifting? And what a bonding experience for the family, too; "Grandma, 
        thanks so much for coming, now just grab that sofa right there."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course students could limit this stress by accomplishing 
        some of this evacuation procedure earlier, but that would pose several 
        problems. Even in the simplest case, for a Maine resident who owns a car, 
        this would still necessitate missing some of the commencement schedule 
        and precious last moments with friends, to make one or more trips homes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For those students who do not live nearby, or do not have 
        a car, the process of packing threatens to consume even more time. While 
        not being able to "join librarians to view plans of ongoing renovations" 
        might not bring tears to the eye, missing a final lunch with a friend 
        because Bowdoin insists on a Saturday departure, is a real shame.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot stay forever; we know that. But, it probably would 
        not do the College any great harm to allow students to leave a mere 24 
        hours later. Nor is this scheduling particularly wise for Bowdoin on a 
        purely financial level. Bowdoin has already stepped up the campaign to 
        siphon money from its students as they prepare to make their way into 
        the workforce. Wouldn't the alumni purse strings be just a little more 
        loose if students' last memories of the College were not being thrust 
        out the very second they received their diplomas?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin's administration pontificates a lot about how the 
        college experience is about personal growth, cultivating a lifelong love 
        of knowledge, and helping our community. When the College expels its graduating 
        class just a few hours after commencement, the experience seems to be 
        more about money. Thanks for the cash, and don't let the door hit you 
        on the way out. "Bowdoin, from birth, our nurturer and friend / To thee 
        we pledge our love again, again…"</p>
