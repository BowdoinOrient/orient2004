      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might not be a great catch to start a commentary with 
        a caveat, but we'll offer one nonetheless. Students not doing honors projects 
        this term (Oh, you clairvoyant ones!) might find this editorial a tad 
        extraneous to their existence, and those undertaking honors projects will 
        perhaps want to avoid any discussion of them. That said, for those less 
        weary students doing projects, and for Bowdoin's faculty, we provide a 
        suggestion for the evaluation of honors projects.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Normally when students complete their honors projects their 
        papers are deposited at the doorstep of the appropriate department, where 
        professors gather to logically shred, er...read the papers submitted. 
        An oral examination follows, after which professors discuss the papers 
        and decide upon whether-and in some cases to what degree-students deserve 
        honors. Lastly, the beleaguered students trudge to the library to submit 
        their papers and nurse their wounds.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Bates, our sibling institution to the north, adds an interesting 
        element to this process. When students complete their theses, the department 
        sends them to professors of the same discipline at peer colleges for review. 
        In fact, several Bowdoin professors are, at the moment, commenting on 
        Bates students' projects. The remarks of these outside adjudicators will 
        then be taken into account by Bates faculty members when they evaluate 
        students' candidacies for honors.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This system has a couple advantages over our own. First, 
        the Bates protocol benefits students by allowing them a larger, if only 
        slightly, audience. The majority of all papers we write at college are 
        read by only one other individual, belonging to the same institution as 
        ourselves. Even if our papers do not make it more than a half-hour away 
        to Bates, it is consoling to think a full year's worth of punishing work 
        will be appreciated by a person outside Bowdoin's faculty before dying 
        a dusty death in Bowdoin's archives (who can honestly say they have checked 
        an honors project out from the library?).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, and most importantly, the Bates scheme provides 
        at least a partial antidote to departmental biases and politics. If Bates 
        professors were to malign a student's work and an outside professor were 
        to praise its scholarship, which would send a clear message to Bates professors 
        that they might at least question their initial reactions. While Bowdoin 
        professors are very unlikely to be unfair, it surely boosts students' 
        confidence in the evaluation process to know that checks and balances 
        exist. And a little consolation is all many honors candidates are looking 
        for these days.</p>
