      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>After an inadvertently-long break, today we resume 
        our series with the story of the author's final year at Bowdoin, and his 
        apologies for having missed publication on March 9 due to a mix-up in 
        dates. </i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to efforts on my behalf by Professors Whiteside 
        and Brown, another spell Beneath the Pines was made possible through a 
        Rotary Club Scholarship. In return, I was to give talks at Rotary Clubs 
        throughout the State of Maine, including the one at Brunswick of course. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before my talk there could go ahead, however, there 
        occurred an embarrassing hitch. Having mixed up the dates (an innate failing 
        it seems) for my planned appearance before this prestigious audience of 
        local worthies, including College President Stacy Coles, who was to introduce 
        me, I blithely went for a walk down McKeen Street at the appointed hour. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a frantic call to the fraternity from Stacy saying 
        that the assembled Rotarians were waiting for me to address them, someone 
        came running after me. Hotfooting it downtown, I arrived just as they 
        were settling down to coffee and cigars after the luncheon I was to have 
        shared with them as guest of honour. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of breath and flushed with embarrassment, I stammered 
        something by way of apology before starting my talk that luckily made 
        them laugh. Turning serious, I, as always, discussed the artificial border 
        between East and West Germany, one for which Winston Churchill in a now-famous 
        speech at Fulton, Missouri, had coined the phrase "Iron Curtain." Little 
        did anyone know that this was not to be raised for more than a generation. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scholarship covering tuition only, Old Nellie had 
        kindly offered to defray my travel and living expenses. While continuing 
        to take meals at the fraternity, I now roomed off-campus, sharing the 
        top floor of a house on Union Street-appropriately enough owned by a Mrs. 
        Lincoln-with Zal Colodny and Ed Povoll. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine was the small room at the back with a slanted ceiling 
        and a dormer window on the side of the lovely old clapboard house where 
        "Jancy," the Jeep station wagon, stood parked, on loan to me from Bill 
        Beckett, Nellie's adopted son. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill and his wife Nancy now drove a brand-new Mercedes 
        given to them by her as a belated wedding present. Not quite brand-new, 
        actually, since I had chauffeured the old girl in it around Europe for 
        six weeks in early '56, having picked it up in person at the factory in 
        Stuttgart. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Madrid, Nellie came down with a severe cold and was 
        confined to bed for several days with an alarmingly high temperature. 
        A doctor I called was amazed to hear the patient was nearly eighty. Let's 
        get the hell out of here, Lou, she defiantly said one morning, and so 
        we did. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving in Rome on Palm Sunday, we parked opposite 
        St Peter's. One would need diplomatic corps plates or Mafia connections 
        to do that today. Walking across the colonnaded square, tiny crosses made 
        from palm leaves were handed to us by smiling people just coming from 
        mass. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several days in Florence, we moved on to Venice, 
        invariably staying in four- or five-star hotels, and from there, we drove 
        through the Dolomites to Vienna. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included in our program at Vienna were the Spanish Riding 
        School, the Prater (with Ferris Wheel, famously used by Orson Wells in 
        the "Third Man"), the wine village of Grinzing high up the other side 
        of the Danube (no longer blue, alas), and the Opera House, just re-opened, 
        with Beethoven's "Fidelio" being performed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the trip, I introduced Nellie to my parents 
        at Bonn. Over dinner at the Hotel Petersberg-now a government guest house 
        where the Queen, de Gaulle, and Breszhnev stayed during state visits in 
        the sixties and seventies-overlooking the Rhine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nellie jokingly asked them if she could take me back 
        with her to America. Okay. Okay, my father laughed, about the only words 
        of English he knew. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accumulate sufficient credits to qualify 
        for a BA in English, I had been advised to attend summer school before 
        returning to Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nellie suggested the University of Virginia, where I 
        spent two weeks before transferring to Columbia University, my first choice, 
        though not hers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A big city held too many distractions and temptations 
        for a young man like me, she claimed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As usual, she was right of course. Though enrolled at 
        Columbia for courses in 19th-century English literature-the novels I liked, 
        the poetry less so-I was really studying at the University of Life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such extra-curricular activities began on arrival in 
        New York, a new landfall, with my friend Simon whisking me off to a room 
        Nellie had reserved for me at the Plaza Hotel. Comparatively innocent 
        though these were, they amounted to a fall from grace it would take a 
        Victorian novel to describe, rather than a series of short, if entertaining, 
        features nearing the end anyway. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, once safely back Beneath the Pines-out of reach 
        of metropolitan distractions (though not necessarily temptation) as intended 
        by the Puritan founders of Bowdoin-I wholeheartedly once more devoted 
        myself to strictly academic pursuits. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among books not on the reading lists I devoured was 
        a novel by Thomas Mann called Felix Krull, which described the adventures, 
        amorous and otherwise, of a happy-go-lucky young man not for nothing called 
        Felix, to whom "nothing human is alien." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else I read, off and on, for most of the year 
        were the Journals of André Gide. Starting one of my own, I copied appropriate 
        quotations from his such as "What is more glorious than a soul when it 
        liberates itself?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting Gide's grave at Cuverville in Normandy 
        not long ago made me think of how I discovered the great French author, 
        who died in 1951, only a few years later at college. Likewise, I also 
        read Henry James, about whose late novels and short stories I was to write 
        an honors paper. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the space of a few months, my life had profoundly 
        changed in several respects-emotional as well as intellectual. For one 
        thing, I had discovered physical love, though for the time being not the 
        kind considered acceptable by the majority. However when eventually discovering 
        the approved sort, I was to do so with a vengeance, as though wanting 
        to make up for lost time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For another, I no longer wanted to be a politician, 
        but an author. And still do. It's never too late, they say. </p>
