      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"><b>&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dear 
        Dr. Jeff: I was recently seen in the Health Center for possible mono. 
        I already had mono once before, and you said you weren't supposed to be 
        able to get it again (though some people believed they had.) I tested 
        negative this time, but you said that didn't absolutely mean I didn't 
        have mono. I'm confused! What's the story here? L.T.</font></b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear L.T.: Infectious Mononucleosis is a contagious 
        illness characterized by fever, pharyngitis ("sore throat"), swollen lymph 
        nodes ("glands"), and often severe fatigue. It is caused by Epstein Barr 
        Virus, a member of the Herpesvirus family, which infects primarily the 
        cells lining the nose and throat and B cell lymphocytes (white blood cells). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Viral DNA is incorporated into B cell DNA, and these 
        transformed B cells carry the infection to other organs in the body, especially 
        the liver and spleen. Some of these infected B cells become "immortalized", 
        forever harboring the viral genome. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full import of this transformation is not yet well 
        understood, but it has been linked to a variety of disorders, including 
        Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and certain malignancies in Africa.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the developing world, infection with Epstein Barr 
        Virus is widespread and most commonly occurs in early childhood as a mild, 
        often unnoticed "cold". In the United States, fewer than half of children 
        have been infected by the age of 5. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 12 percent of susceptible college-age men and 
        women are infected each year with the virus, and about half of them develop 
        clinical mononucleosis. That means that nearly 1 in 50 students may come 
        down with mono every year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transmission of Epstein Barr Virus takes place through 
        contact with infected saliva (hence mono as the "kissing disease"). The 
        incubation period is about 30-45 days. The illness typically lasts 2-4 
        weeks, is almost always self-limited, and rarely requires medical intervention. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of communicability, however, is prolonged, 
        and viral shedding in saliva may persist for a year or more after the 
        infection has "resolved".<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because mono usually causes inflammation of the liver, 
        and often leads to swelling of the spleen, alcohol and contact sports 
        must be avoided during the illness. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B cells infected with Epstein Barr Virus produce a variety 
        of new antibodies, among them the "heterophile antibody." Most "mono tests" 
        (for instance, the "Monospot" test we use at the Health Center) look for 
        this heterophile antibody in a patient's serum, but test results can be 
        difficult to interpret. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the antibody is present at some point during the 
        illness in about 90% of patients, it may appear earlier or later. It usually 
        disappears 3 or 4 months after the illness, but it may persist longer. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, a monospot test might be falsely negative 
        if done too early, or falsely positive if done too soon after a prior 
        (and resolved) infection-and "too early" might mean anywhere from 1 to 
        4 weeks, and "too soon" might mean 6 months or more!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heterophile antibody is not protective against Epstein 
        Barr Virus. It is produced by infected B cells, which are prompted by 
        the incorporated viral DNA, and it reacts with the red blood cells of 
        other species (hence "heterophile").<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antibodies directed against Epstein Barr Virus itself 
        are also made soon after infection (by uninfected T cells and B cells). 
        They are believed to confer long-term immunity. Their presence is also 
        more straightforwardly diagnostic of an acute infection. They are detected, 
        however, by laboratory tests which are far less common, and far more expensive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important laboratory sign of Infectious Mononucleosis 
        is the presence of large numbers of "atypical lymphocytes" (the infected 
        B cells). Taken alone, however, this finding is not terribly specific. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many different viral illnesses also cause an 
        increase in atypical lymphocytes, including those which also cause Infectious 
        Mononucleosis-like illnesses nearly indistinguishable from Epstein Barr 
        Virus infection (like Cytomegalovirus, Human Herpesvirus Type 6, Toxoplasmosis, 
        and Rubella).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, then, diagnosis of mono can be a little 
        complicated. Though it may cause short-term misery, the illness is fortunately 
        almost always short-lived, and rarely causes complications. </p>
