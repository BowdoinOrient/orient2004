      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touted architectural connection between Bowdoin 
        and Harvard is frequently limited to the nascent years of our institution. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massachusetts Hall and the Quad bear a striking resemblance 
        to similar features of the Yard upon which our campus was modeled. The 
        extent of our connection is often limited to this Georgian period in our 
        history, but at the turn of the century, a similarity with our sister 
        institution resurfaced. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the predominant social structure of 
        the campus was oriented toward the fraternal houses. A place where students 
        of different backgrounds and affiliations could socialize was desperately 
        needed, both at Bowdoin and at Harvard. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This need resulted in the construction of some of the 
        first collegiate "union" buildings in America. As with Massachusetts Hall 
        and the Yard, Harvard provided the example.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1901, the beaux-arts architect Charles McKim was 
        commissioned to design a "great house…a meeting-house of all Harvard men-alumni, 
        students, teachers." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was indeed a great house, inspiring the words of 
        such figures as Henry James and George Santayana. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-seven years later, Bowdoin commissioned the same 
        firm to design a union building. Although on the exterior the buildings 
        bear little resemblance, their internal resemblance is noteworthy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great hall in both the Harvard and Moulton (Bowdoin) 
        Unions, McKim's firm designed a tall stone chamber, the bottom story of 
        which is finished in ornamental wood. The classical organization is punctuated 
        by clerestory windows in each and constructed with similar proportions. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Differences are apparent, however; Bowdoin's building 
        features a second-story balcony and Harvard's a prominent over-door finished 
        with wrought-iron gates.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking similarity of the two buildings is 
        not part of the interior detailing; it is the original functioning of 
        the two buildings. Both served as places of quiet repose and conversation 
        apart from academic or fraternal structures on the campuses. One might 
        characterize them as gentleman's clubs for students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the original unions of both campuses do not function 
        as they once did. The Harvard Union has been transformed in a controversial 
        renovation which divided the great hall into two smaller humanities halls. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moulton, although not used for academic purposes, functions 
        as an administrative center of campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both buildings are remnants of a different time and 
        no longer suit the needs of the institutions which built them as unions. 
        The time when students socialized in armchairs by fireside is gone, but 
        the value of the spaces as gathering rooms has not been diminished.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moulton Union is the best example of neo-classic and 
        modern synthesis on the campus. The integrity of the exterior facade and 
        historic interior spaces is intact. The modern additions to the building 
        are sympathetic and engage in meaningful discussion with the classical 
        elements. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such architectural dialogue has been woefully absent 
        in more recent stylistic syntheses on campus, such as the renovations 
        of Searles and Memorial Halls.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moulton Union embodies the best of both styles, yet 
        manages to make them work together to achieve the comfortable domestic/academic 
        feeling particular to Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Moulton Union has been severed from its original 
        function, yet serves our campus nobly for other purposes. It would nonetheless 
        be wonderful to capitalize on the kind of spaces it offers to students. 
        One way to re-integrate the old union into a new student body would be 
        to use the Maine Lounge for formal dining on a regular basis. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universities in England have long benefited from more 
        formal dining settings where academic discussions penetrate into mealtime. 
        This would be a welcomed addition to the already renowned dining services 
        Bowdoin has to offer and would help students and faculty alike to refamiliarize 
        themselves with our history and a wonderful building. </p>
