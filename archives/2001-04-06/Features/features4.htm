      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The continent stretched from one bright blue ocean 
        to another. Between its great valleys and magnificent rivers was an untapped 
        well of prosperity and opportunity. Its evergreen forests bristled with 
        life. Its unending prairies teemed with herds of buffalo that grazed without 
        fear of any other beast. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its swamps and bayous, alligators and snapping turtles 
        crawled through the luscious mud and emerged in the grand rivers that 
        divulged their plentiful bounty into the grand gulf which would soon be 
        named Mexico. From its mountain tops, the majestic bald eagle flew with 
        wings unhampered by the rippling winds that blew from valley to mountain 
        and onwards to the sea. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of years ago, they emerged on this continent 
        via a bridge that was soon swallowed by the fury of the ocean and the 
        shifting of the continents. From the tip of that new land, they moved 
        southwards and eastwards until they were separated from each other and 
        became different tribes and cultures. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were those who hunted and those who fished. There 
        were those who planted and grazed their animals. They camped in the fields, 
        hibernated in the forests, swam in the lakes, and became the children 
        of the new land. They had great respect for this continent that had taken 
        them in. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For generations they prospered, taking only that which 
        they needed to sustain themselves. There was peace, but there was also 
        war, for they had varying concepts of life and honor and death. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the violence, there was a strange beauty 
        to their existence. Not one of pearls and diamonds and cloth, but one 
        of natural eminence. They were the pinnacle of natural creation, and they 
        were the guardians of a land they came to call home.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the east, there came ships one day, and from these 
        ships came an unknown group of human beings. They recognized these strangers 
        as human beings, but they could not understand what they wore or why their 
        skin was so much whiter than their own. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these sailors and explorers came more settlers, 
        and within years there were so many of these people from across the sea 
        that the natives began to feel uncomfortable. These people brought with 
        them long sticks they called muskets and powerful drinks that made a man 
        lose control. They came and they took what the wanted. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The natives fought them, but they were no match for 
        the armor of the men who wore red and blue. And thus the continent began 
        to change, and the natives began to worry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strangers called the land America and went about 
        their business for a long while. During this time, large villages and 
        grand enterprises were created and eventually blossomed. There was peace 
        with the new arrivals, but the natives could not help but feel that there 
        was a danger in them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wars began and ended in treaties, which were broken, 
        which led to more wars. Slowly the natives were pushed back, deeper and 
        deeper into the continent. Tribes met and discussed the fate of their 
        continent. No one quite knew what was happening to it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one day there was a spark in the cities of the intruders 
        and from the forests around the town called Concord, Massachusetts a flame 
        was ignited. For the first time the word "liberty" was proclaimed, and 
        thus the continent stirred with the painful spasms of birth. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was waged a war of rebellion that lasted for many 
        summers. The natives took part in this as well, not knowing what was to 
        become of them should either side succeed. In time there rose a government 
        unlike any the world had ever seen. This government began in earnest to 
        conquer the continent. They called it "Manifest Destiny," and from the 
        ports and towns of the East, there came an invasion force of unknown proportion. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settlers with families and children on horse drawn carriages 
        and wagons moved inland, in search of a place to call home. Others moved 
        more rapidly with pick axes and shovels in search of gold and fortune. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far removed from the growth on the East Coast, a small 
        band of Native Americans continued to do what they had been doing for 
        centuries. They would soon be named the Nez Perce by some French Canadians. 
        Their first encounter with their new neighbors was cordial enough. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Native American woman led two foreign men named Lewis 
        and Clark through their territory in what was to the foreigners the year 
        1805. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nez Perce homeland encompassed a great deal of land 
        on the north-western border. They would soon learn that the settlers had 
        named their territory. Washington Territory, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and 
        Wyoming were all within their range. It is in the eastern part of the 
        Washington Territory that our story really begins, and it begins with 
        the birth of a young Nez Perce by the name of Joseph. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph's father had also been named Joseph, thanks to 
        a Christian missionary who had settled in the area. The younger Joseph 
        had a brother named Ollokut and a land that had been unspoiled by war 
        or invasion. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he grew, however, young Joseph learned that his ancestral 
        territory was being shrunken by the new settlers. He paid little attention 
        to this and continued to do what young New Perce did. He indulged in the 
        fruits of the earth. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned to become an excellent horseman as almost 
        all the Nez Perce were. He swan in the lakes, hunted in the forests, spoke 
        with the land, and became a part of it, but sensing too that its days 
        were numbered.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1855, a treaty was made with the governor of the 
        Washington Territory. The treaty set aside vast lands for the many tribes 
        of the Nez Perce. This settlement would hopefully retain the peace between 
        the two cultures. The Old Joseph agreed to this, as did most of his fellow 
        chiefs from the other Nez Perce groups. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1860, however, gold was discovered in Nez Perce territory, 
        and settlers began to encroach upon their hunting lands. Violence exploded 
        as settlers and Nez Perce clashed. A new treaty was formed in 1863, this 
        time reducing the Nez Perce territory by an even greater amount. Old Joseph 
        did not sign this treaty, but a majority of the chiefs did. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph returned to his home in the Wallowa Valley, and 
        on his deathbed in 1871, he made his son swear that he would never surrender 
        this land. To this, the young Joseph did swear, but he knew full well 
        that, despite the fact that there was no gold to be had in the Wallowa 
        Valley, there would soon be trouble with the settlers and with the military. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, young Joseph was diplomatic. He sought peace, 
        but again and again the white settlers intruded and broke the already 
        fragile relationship. Still, Joseph was reluctant to spill blood. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Washington D.C. came an order for Joseph's Nez 
        Perce to move from the scarred Wallowa Valley to the Lapwai Reservation 
        where other Nez Perce had been living since 1863. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn between his responsibility to the land and by his 
        unyielding need to seek peaceful solution, Joseph appealed to the military 
        department commander for a conference. This was granted, and in 1877, 
        right before the start of the Nez Perce War, Joseph, along with many other 
        chiefs, came to the bargaining table one last time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representing the government of the United States at 
        this bargaining table was a Bowdoin graduate and a Civil War veteran by 
        the name of Oliver Howard.<br>
