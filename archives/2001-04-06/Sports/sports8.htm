      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not gonna lie, I knew absolutely nothing about 
        crew before I decided to write about it for the spring sports section 
        of "The Oldest Continuously Published College Weekly in the United States" 
        or something like that. So I sat down with the men's team captain William 
        LoVerme '02 in an attempt to gain a b.s.-worthy knowledge of the sport 
        so I could at least give credit to the rowers that deserved such. Here's 
        a preview of the 2001 spring rowing season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case you faithful readers haven't noticed, Maine 
        is experiencing a shortage of bare ground and grass, more so than normal 
        for this time of year. The calendar claims 'tis the season for budding 
        flowers, chirping birds, mosquitos, hatching chicks and all that; however, 
        many of the spring sports teams at Bowdoin have suffered from the mass 
        accumulation of snow that refuses to melt. For sports such as lacrosse 
        and tennis, the athletes have been able to practice indoors at Farley 
        Field House.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the unfortunate crew team was unable to get 
        on the water until the second week of spring break, due to the fact that 
        the river was still frozen. "This is the longest we've ever had to stay 
        on the erg [machine]," stated LoVerme. Because of this, continued LoVerme, 
        the team is still working on technique in preparation for the upcoming 
        spring sprint season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears lost two important rowers to graduation last 
        spring, Will Colvin '00 (6'9", 220 lbs), and Dave Thomas '00 (6'4", 210 
        lbs). LoVerme noted that due to this fact the men's V1 boat is smaller 
        in size than it was last spring, with an average height of 6'1" and an 
        average weight of 180 lbs. The men's team finished the fall season with 
        a 52-1 record, not including Head of the Charles. Rowing in the men's 
        V1 Stroke: Will LoVerme '02, 3: Tyler Lang '03, 2: Gordon Clarke '03, 
        bow: Tom Scifres '03, with Leah Chernikoff '04 as coxswain. Rowing in 
        the men's N1: stroke: Tom Ricciardi '04, 3: Colin Drake '04, 2: Elliot 
        Jacobs '04, bow: Chad Pelton 04, with coxswain Juleah Swanson '04. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approaching the spring season, the men's team has many 
        titles to defend, and we're much smaller [in physical size] than we were 
        last year" said LoVerme. "If we can nail down the technique and get our 
        stroke rate back up, we should be in great shape this season. We've done 
        the conditioning, now we need to apply the technique." This remains a 
        challenge to the team, due to uncontrollable conditions [the frozen river], 
        but the team remains optimistic. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team had high hopes in the fall and finished 
        the season 33-14. They meet the spring season with many injuries. Due 
        to these injuries, a few changed have occurred in the boat rosters. The 
        women's V1 roster is as follows: Stroke: captain Erin Jaworski '01, 3: 
        captain Kelly Ricciardi '01, 2: Lindsey Sortor '02, bow: Abby Lockwood 
        '01, with Mary Miner '02 as coxswain. In the women's N1: stroke: Sadie 
        Anderson '04, 3: Jackie Templeton '03, 2: Alison McConnell '04, bow: Alicia 
        Smith '04, with Katie Smith '03 as coxswain. Ricciardi comments on the 
        team's attitude towards the spring season: "While there have been some 
        difficulties with injuries and illnesses over the past few weeks, it has 
        been great to see the effort and poise shown by many people on the team 
        who have had to move up and fill some pretty big shoes. I am looking forward 
        to another incredible, successful season!"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring crew season includes three early season races 
        and three championship races. On April 7, the team heads to Lake Quinsigamond, 
        in Massachussetts, to compete against Assumption and the Vermont schools. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the cold and the rest, hopefully the races'll run.
