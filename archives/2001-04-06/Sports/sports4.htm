      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if you'd need another reason to spend your weekend 
        at MIT, the men's tennis team will be playing against the Engineers this 
        Sunday (that really is their mascot, by the way). The Polar Bears expect 
        an exciting game, as MIT is one of their biggest rivals. "We anticipate 
        a great season all around," said Louis Plough '03. "Last season was the 
        best in Bowdoin's history." The team was ranked 16th at the end of last 
        year and their preseason ranking puts them 15th in the nation for Division 
        III.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's tennis players have already started out with 
        a strong record. They spent their spring break in Hilton Head, South Carolina, 
        claiming many notable victories including a 7-0 win against the Coast 
        Guard. In addition, they defeated Wesleyan and Principia, both by a score 
        of 6-1. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skidmore and Luther went much like the Coast Guard, 
        winning not a single match. "We started out strong on our trip to South 
        Carolina and that was the spark that the team needed," said Bowdoin head 
        coach, Jane Paterson.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our first years gained a lot of confidence and that 
        translated into some clutch wins during critical matches. We'll look to 
        match last year's recipe this spring."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Paterson has been coaching both the men's and 
        women's tennis teams for three years. During her career as Bowdoin's tennis 
        coach, she has helped them achieve a 16-3 record, the best in school history. 
        She also saw them advance to the NCAA second round for only the second 
        time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, coach Paterson hopes to look towards the 
        future. She has built the men's tennis team of younger players, mostly 
        sophomores, five first years, and one Senior, Evan Klein, who is also 
        the captain.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining the team this year are John Carolan '04 who 
        plays number five in singles, Pat Soong '04, sixth in singles and third 
        in doubles, Ed Holmes '04, who plays second doubles alongside sophomore 
        Nicolas MacLean. Other doubles players are first-years John Posie, Peter 
        Carter, and Fred Warburg. Returning veterans include sophomores August 
        Felker, Colin Joyner, Louis Plough, Andy Miness, and MacLean.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyner and Felker look forward to this season, especially 
        after having advanced to the NCAA championship doubles tournament last 
        year. Their overall record was an impressive 19-7, with a record of 14-3 
        in dual matches. "Colin and August are fierce competitors and they work 
        very hard to be prepared for every match," said Paterson. "Whether it 
        is in doubles or singles, they feed off each other's energy and give us 
        great strength at the top of the line up."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to playing MIT this weekend, the Polar Bears 
        will face off against Babson on Saturday. "You don't need to worry about 
        Babson. They equal Joke. We expect to beat everybody. We're not going 
        to lose to anyone," said Plough.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polar Bears' first on-campus matches are next weekend. 
        They play Tufts on the 13th, Middlebury on the 14th, and NYU the next 
        day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their most exciting match of the season should come 
        on April 22 when they return to Amherst to claim a victory that should 
        have been theirs a year ago. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's a big one," said Plough. "We're out for blood, 
        bro. Last year we were intimidated by the Amherst name. We didn't play 
        our game. But now we're back and we're better than ever. Definitely."
