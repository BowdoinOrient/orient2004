      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring is just around the corner and these warm sunny 
        days have students and alumni alike yearning for the chance to jump into 
        the pool. This week you get to meet a student who excels at just that. 
        According to Coach Harvey Wheeler, for the past four years Singer has 
        been the most consistent D-III diver in the country.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer began diving when she was eight years old. Perhaps 
        ironically, diving was her second choice, "I originally wanted to do gymnastics, 
        but my parents didn't want me to. So diving was the next closest thing." 
        Like most young swimmers and divers she got her start at her summer club 
        and continued to swim and dive until high school, when diving became her 
        primary athletic focus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most divers, Singer mentioned Greg Lougainis as 
        a hero of hers: "He is by far the most amazing diver, and overcame so 
        much adversity both in his childhood and adult life. He is definitely 
        a hero of mine." While she doesn't have any particular female athlete 
        whom she looks up to, Singer stressed the importance of women's sports, 
        emphasizing that "Participating in sports does so much for a person, and 
        I think it's critical that girls be encouraged to partake." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer claims, as most athletes are wont to do, that 
        she has grown steadily less superstitious. Nonetheless she admits to having 
        a lucky suit and bringing stuffed animals to meets.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since arriving at Bowdoin, Singer has worked closely 
        with Coach Wheeler, and she credits him with helping her grow and improve 
        both in and out of the water. In the water," says Singer, "he has such 
        a vast understanding of the sport, and finds ways to help us understand 
        how to improve our dives. He also puts in more effort outside of the pool 
        than any coach I have worked with." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer also paid tribute to her coach for helping her 
        understand the value of hard work, even when it doesn't yield the desired 
        results. She also says "Harvey has been a wonderful coach and friend to 
        me over the past 4 years." And isn't that what a coach truly should be?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singer may remain humble about her success, claiming 
        not to have really thought about being a five-time All-American, her coach 
        is plenty willing to offer praise. And well he should be. The first thing 
        Wheeler had to say was that Singer is truly an amazing athlete, pointing 
        out that she the first Bowdoin diver to earn first team All-American honors 
        for four straight years. Singer was also a finalist in the New England 
        championships eight times (the maximum possible) and named the NESCAC 
        Senior diver of 2001 (awarded to the diver who has scored the most points 
        in the championship meet over four years). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Wheeler continued though, saying, "I could go 
        on and on about all the records that she has broken, but the most meaningful 
        factor, in my opinion, is her work ethic. She has maintained an attendance 
        percentage, FAR above expectations. She has practiced during pain, frustration 
        and illness. She has been willing to address her weaknesses as well as 
        her strengths. It has given me great pleasure to see such a deserving 
        athlete accomplish so much 'the old fashioned way.'"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer's Bowdoin career includes much more than just 
        diving; she is an economics major and government minor, a grader for the 
        economics department as well as a tutor at a local school. She does point 
        to being part of the swimming and diving team as an integral piece of 
        her Bowdoin experience. She says that diving has "been a great outlet 
        from the academic world, and allowed me to continue a passion I developed 
        early on." She also spoke highly of her teammates and of the athletic 
        community at Bowdoin in general, mentioning, "All [Bowdoin] athletes have 
        a special respect for one another, and are very supportive of each other." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singer also spoke fondly of the feelings of camaraderie 
        and competition fostered at Nationals among the divers there. She said 
        "Division III Nationals is definitely the most enjoyable meet I have ever 
        competed in. The energy level there, and being surrounded by so many talented 
        athletes is really amazing. There is definitely something special about 
        collegiate sports."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she leaves Bowdoin this spring, the Polar Bears 
        will lose one of their top athletes and most accomplished competitors. 
        In closing Singer would like to wish the Bowdoin Swimming and Diving Team 
        all the best in the future. </p>
