      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin's Ultimate team, the Stoned Clown, has made 
        a turn around this year. The Clown, who previously had few tournaments 
        with a winning record, emerged from the fall season with a winning record 
        and looks forward to the coming season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Jon Knapp '02 stated that the turn around was 
        the result of a several changes. "We had new blood in the freshmen, they 
        knew what they were doing and were pumped about playing. They got the 
        others pumped. Additionally, there was a feeling among the upperclassmen 
        of being not so hot on losing."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the year the year the Clown held a meeting 
        at which they decided that they were tired of losing after an 0-5 showing 
        at one tournament. After that the Clown went to sectionals and went 4-1, 
        beating several strong college teams.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning sectionals qualified them for regionals. Knapp 
        said that the Clown had not ever qualified for regionals before. There 
        were several leaders of this turnaround, according to Knapp. "The captains, 
        me and [Brian Mohr '01], provided some leadership. But some of the leadership 
        also came from Brendan Dickinson and [Professor David] Silbey."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the fall season the Clown was ranked 16th 
        regionally and fifth within their section, behind such ultimate powerhouses 
        like Harvard and Tufts.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harvard is the best team in the section," said Knapp. 
        "MIT is probably second, and third is kind of fuzzy. We are in the mix 
        for third with Boston University, University of New Hampshire, and University 
        of Maine Farmington."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clown placed second in Maine last semester behind 
        Farmington, losing to the Beaver by one point at the Pine Tree championships. 
        The Clown record was 6-6 against other colleges and 15-10 overall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the Clown's favorite memories of last season 
        revolve around the turn around at sectionals. Jeremy Katzen '04 stated 
        that the comeback against Tufts was a great time, as was "embarrassing 
        that high school team." Katzen was referring to the Clown's defeat of 
        two-time national high school champion Newton North.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brendan Dickinson '04 stated that the whole day was 
        fun. "There was a level of excitement at those games," he said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickinson and the Clown have been preparing for the 
        upcoming season. "We have been running, lifting weights, playing basketball 
        to work on agility, as well as throwing around indoors," he said. He added 
        that he would have liked to have done more.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dickinson and Knapp both look forward to the Clown's 
        success at the sectional tournament. "We will do well at sectionals," 
        said Knapp. "We will face some challenges at the regional level though." 
        Dickinson also predicts that the Clown will do very well at the smaller 
        tournaments the Clown will attend this season. </p>
