      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Liquid Platypus will be playing this Saturday at 9:30 p.m. 
        in the Pub. The band members sat down for a quick interview before rehearsal.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: So you're playing in the pub this weekend. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Yes. It's a big step up for us, as our last gig 
        was in a grungy dive, but we think we're ready for it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Orient: I hope so. I know you've gone through many ups and 
        downs in your time together; has this meteoric rise upset any of the band's 
        cohesiveness? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Only a little bit. Just the other day we were 
        arguing about the proper sideburn length for our image, and Emily's flute 
        often brings to the fore some of the male band members' own insecurities 
        with their masculinity, but otherwise it's been more or less fine. The 
        important thing is the band's recent attainment of self-satisfaction. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: I've noticed that you're answering all my 
        questions collectively, speaking in unison in an eerie monotone. How have 
        you attained that kind of togetherness with all the recent additions to 
        the personnel? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Well, you see we have a flute as our lead instrument. 
        Some people say it's like this, and some people say it's like that, but 
        peoples is peoples. The flute lends an interesting quality, we think. 
        We have always thought. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: Well, then… How would you describe your music? 
        Some people have said it's funky, some people have said it's rockish, 
        and some people have said you play "an interesting blend of alternative 
        rock and jazz." Explain. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: The use of ordinary language is inadequate. We've 
        found the best descriptions for our style come from the underwater world 
        of the humpback whale. (They take out a tape player and press play. The 
        incredible sounds of the whale's song fill the room.) I'm sure this will 
        help you to understand. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: Yes… I see it much more clearly now. I suppose 
        the only way to truly understand it is to listen to it, am I wrong? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: You understand us exactly. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Orient: Okay… returning to the "funky" aspect of your music, 
        how would you describe that element? Being Bowdoin College students, you 
        obviously don't look terribly funky… <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Take off your sunglasses. Orient: Excuse me?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: You have to take off your sunglasses so you can 
        see the funk. <i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Orient</i>: (takes off sunglasses) Ah, yes. I see it now. 
        Anyway, do you think you could give us any information about the members 
        of the band? There are many rumors floating around about you guys… <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Well, most of those are terrible lies. Dana is 
        not, and never has been, involved in any kind of mafia activity and that 
        thing about Steve and the twelve Haitians is complete fabrication. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: Interesting. I'm glad you've given me the 
        opportunity to let the truth be known. Now, how long have you been together 
        as a band? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Forever. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: What do you mean? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Forever. Orient: There must have been a certain 
        time when you met… <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: No. Orient: Well, when were you born?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: (silence). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Orient</i>: Ok… Well, good luck on Saturday and it's been 
        a pleasure talking with you. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>LP</b>: Thanks. </p>
