      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this Friday's Common Hour, Anna Deavere Smith, an 
        award winning playwright, actor, and teacher, will be at Bowdoin to deliver 
        a special presentation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Smith has been called "the most exciting individual in American 
        theater," and in 1996 received a prestigious "Genius" fellowship from 
        the MacArthur Foundation, for her creation of "a new form of theatre-a 
        blend of theatrical art, social commentary, journalism and intimate reverie." 
        She has appeared in films including Philadelphia, The American President, 
        and Dave as well as television series including The West Wing and The 
        Practice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout her wide-ranging career, Smith has continually 
        received praise for her various accomplishments. Over the past 18 years, 
        Smith has created a body of theatrical work, which she calls "On the Road: 
        Search for American Character." The media, critics, and audiences across 
        the country have praised Smith's work, which explores the American character 
        and our multifaceted national identity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Smith has written and performed several critically acclaimed 
        plays including "Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn and Other 
        Identities" and "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992." "Fires in the Mirror", 
        written in 1991, which explores the riots between black and Jews in Crown 
        Heights, Brooklyn. In this play, Smith portrays the brother of a young 
        Lubavitcher, speaking in an Australian accent while wearing a Hasidic 
        hat. In "Twilight: Los Angeles", Smith depicts the former L.A. police 
        commissioner in the aftermath of the riots triggered by the beating of 
        Rodney King. These are just some examples of the wide variety of characters 
        that Smith decides to portray in her performances, and attests to her 
        unique ability to assume different roles.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Her latest play, a work-in-progress called "House Arrest," 
        explores the singular and mythic role that the presidency has played in 
        the American psyche throughout history. "House Arrest" premiered at the 
        New York Shakespeare Festival/ Joseph Pratt Public Theater in the Spring 
        of 2000. In addition to her roles as actor and playwright, Smith teaches 
        at New York University and at Stanford University, where she is the Ann 
        O'Day Maples Professor of the Arts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As a talented playwright and performer, Anna Deavere Smith's 
        work is so impressive because she uses material from real people in order 
        to reveal a story about contemporary America. Her constructions delve 
        into controversial issues facing society today involving race, gender, 
        class, and religion. By interviewing people from all different walks of 
        life, Smith is able to gain a unique perspective, which she incorporates 
        into her theatrical pieces that reflect realties of American life today. 
        The successful portrayal of each inter viewed person's character is one 
        reason why Smith has received so much praise. As a one-woman performer, 
        she accurately and effectively captures the voice of a diversified group 
        of people, in her quest to convey truths of today's society. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1998, Smith founded the Institute on the Arts & Civic 
        Dialogue based at Harvard University. Founded in association with the 
        Ford Foundation, the mission of the Institute is to explore the role of 
        the arts in relation to critical social issues.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Smith's presentation is entitled "Snapshots: Glimpses of 
        America in Change." Smith has also written a book based on her observations 
        and impressions of her time spent in Washington while compiling information 
        to be used for her play "House Arrest".<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Following her presentation in Pickard Theatre, which begins 
        at 12:30 p.m., Ms. Smith will respond to questions from 1:30 to 2:00 p.m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There will also be a booksigning and reception with Ms. Smith 
        in Drake Lobby of Memorial Hall in Pickard Theater from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. 
        Books will be available at the book signing, and at the Bowdoin bookstore 
        prior to the event. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This Friday's Common Hour will require tickets. Tickets are 
        free of charge with a Bowdoin ID and are available at the David Saul Smith 
        Union Information Desk.</p>
