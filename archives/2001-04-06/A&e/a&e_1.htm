      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the rare college student who has never heard a cappella 
        music at some point in his or her academic career. It seems to have become 
        as ubiquitous as "streaking the quad," with enough different types of 
        a cappella as there are students to listen. Example: Yale University has 
        no fewer than seventeen-that's right, as in SEVENTEEN-a cappella groups, 
        and even smaller campuses such as Swarthmore College have upwards of seven 
        or eight. And while Bowdoin holds its own in the a cappella arena with 
        a conservative three groups, one still has to wonder: why all the hubbub 
        over a bunch of singers without instruments?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This Friday, the Boston a cappella supergroup Ball in the 
        House is coming to a Morrell Lounge near you to show the Bowdoin community 
        just what the hype is all about. Their motto is simple: "Six guys. Six 
        mouths. That's it." With these few tools, however, Ball in the House manages 
        to create a dazzling array of sounds, some of which shouldn't physically 
        be able to come out of human beings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Founded in the mid-nineties, BitH (their own abbreviation, 
        trust me) has gone through many incarnations in lineup and style to arrive 
        at the "urban pop" sound they have created for themselves today. Originally 
        a four-man ensemble, the group grew to six in order to incorporate a vocal 
        percussion section that has become a crucial part of their trademark sound. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And while members Jon, Jason, Mike, Dave, Scott, and Stephen 
        (last names are irrelevant in the world of a cappella) all joined the 
        group at different points in its history, they have created an amazingly 
        cohesive sound over the last few years.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Another feature that distinguishes BitH from many-alright, 
        almost all-other a cappella ensembles is the fact that they actually write 
        their own music. Bucking the trend a cappella music seems to have set 
        of arranging versions of already-written songs, BitH has written many 
        of the songs they perform, a unique twist that has helped form a legion 
        of fans from the Boston area and increasingly wherever they tour. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The present group has done more than 600 shows together, 
        opening for such big name acts as Paula Cole, Hootie & the Blowfish, and 
        the Goo Goo Dolls. They have even warmed up crowds for the likes of 98 
        Degrees and-get ready-N'Sync. Now, this fact invites a number of unfortunate 
        comparisons between such similar instrument-lacking, all-male groups, 
        but fortunately for Ball in the House, they have serious talent, despite 
        the swooning you might glimpse from members of the audience. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And for those of you who have waded so patiently through 
        this article to find out exactly why they're called Ball in the House, 
        here's your reward: Remember the episode of "The Brady Bunch" when Bobby 
        breaks a vase? Me neither, but you can probably guess the connection. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Any a cappella concert of such magnitude wouldn't be complete 
        without a little collaboration. In this spirit, Bowdoin's three ensembles-BOCA(or 
        the Indies, depending on who you ask), Miscellania, and the Meddies will 
        be opening the show on Friday night at 8 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; BOCA will be sharing some more of their coed magic with us 
        previously seen this semester in the group's "Bathrooms Tour," an incredibly 
        clever way of exploiting the amazing acoustics of bathrooms (notice how 
        you sound better in the shower than when doing karaoke?). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellania has been kicking it old school for the past couple 
        of months, delving into a little Diana Ross with a hip-hop twist, and 
        will also be warming up the crowd for Ball in the House. And the Meddies…they 
        always have something interesting going on, even though the exact nature 
        of these intriguing "goings-on" is sometimes a mystery. The concert starts 
        at 8 p.m. tonight in Morrell Lounge, and it's free, so come out and see 
        how a band with no instruments can be way cooler than one that has them 
        all.</p>
