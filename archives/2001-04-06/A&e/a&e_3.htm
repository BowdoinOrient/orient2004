      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Question: What do you get when you combine female kickboxing 
        with excessive amounts of nudity, plus a little international intrigue 
        to boot? Answer: A video masterpiece. Angel Fist by far and away exceeded 
        my expectations and surpassed my strict standards of video quality. The 
        box proudly announced, "If looks could kill, they wouldn't have to kick!" 
        Now that is a mighty claim, and a shrewd observation at that, but could 
        it hold true? Would kicking not be a necessary means of claiming a life 
        if looks could indeed kill? Having seen the film, I must say that I am 
        uncertain, but what I can say with the utmost certainty, is that a wet 
        naked girl kicking the crap out of a posse of impolite terrorists (come 
        on, she just stepped out of the shower!) is a beautiful thing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Angel Fist takes place in the Philippines, where a secret 
        society known as the Death Brigade is planning to drive out the democracy-loving 
        Americans by any means necessary. Unfortunately for them, Christi, an 
        American kickboxing star, photographed their latest assassination hit. 
        Unfortunately for Christi, the Death Brigade tracks her down and stabs 
        her repeatedly. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When Christi's older sister Cat Sassoon, a Los Angeles police 
        officer, hears of her sibling's death, she immediately flies off to the 
        Philippines to find some answers and kick some terrorist ass. Cat joins 
        the female kickboxing circuit, quickly rising to be the top-ranking competitor. 
        When she's not in the ring round-housing her opponents, she's in the shower, 
        cooling off her hot body. And if she's not in the ring or in the shower, 
        she's probably fending off sword-toting assassins.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Things really heat-up when she meets Joey, or inexplicably, 
        Alcatraz to his friends. He's a gambler with a heart of gold who wants 
        to help Cat find her sister's killer as well as help her remove his pants. 
        The set for Joey's apartment looks like it would be more appropriate for 
        a film like Thighs Wide Open, but Cat doesn't seem to mind the stripped-down 
        decor. Joey confides in his newfound flame that his dream is to own a 
        sailboat and travel the world by sea. "So what's your dream?" he asks. 
        "I don't really have one. All I want is to know who killed my sister." 
        "I never had a brother or sister, so I never lost one. I don't know what 
        it's like." Thank you Captain Redundancy. While working the kickboxing 
        circuit, Cat discovers that the Death Brigade is operating from inside 
        the karate league itself. When their cover is about to be blown, the Death 
        Brigade captures one of Cat's teammates, demanding information. Information 
        about what, I'm not sure, but that really is of no importance. They try 
        to make her talk by pressing her bare chest against a large block of ice. 
        But she is strong, and resourceful. "When was the last time you undid 
        a bra?" she later asks a guard, who apparently hasn't undone a bra in 
        a very long time. The guard unties her, unbuttons her shirt, and yes, 
        undoes her bra. He is so stunned and perplexed by the sight her boobs, 
        that she is able to kick him in the face. Now that's girl power. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile Cat is fighting for her life in the finals of the 
        Kickboxing Championship. "Today will be your unlucky day!" her evil competitor 
        growls before the match. The dialogue reads like fine poetry. All hell 
        breaks loose when another assassination attempt is made at the karate 
        tournament. Cat Sassoon doesn't hesitate for a second, and jumps out of 
        the ring to kick the crap out of every terrorist in the joint. Soon enough, 
        she and Alcatraz are sailing away into the sunset. The End. Whether or 
        not she ever found her sister's killer, things were left a little unclear, 
        but it sure was a wild ride.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Angel Fist gets an A+++++ (that's pronounced "A" quintuple 
        plus). This film shall forever remain a benchmark in straight-to-video 
        quality. This is one of the few movies I've watched that truly delivered 
        all that it promised, plus a little bit more. Join me here next week: 
        Can you say Steve Guttenburg?</p>
