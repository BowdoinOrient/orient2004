      <p>This week, the Film Society brings you a trio of films all about Superheroes. 
        All these characters got their start in comic books, but have each been 
        expertly brought to the screen. There is a lot of action, crazy costumes, 
        and great one-liners. And even though there are no "Pow! Bam! Zonk!" numbers, 
        you can still have a good time. As always, the films will be shown free 
        of charge in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall and are open to everyone. </p>

        <i>X-Men </i>(2000) <br>
        Directed by: Bryan Singer <br>
        Starring: Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Famke Jansen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna 
        Paquin, Tyler Mane, Ray Park, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Rebecca Romijn-Stamos <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Last summer's blockbuster film is really enjoyable. For those 
        who just want to see a good movie, there's action and comedy; but for 
        comic fans that know the X-Men, there are some great things inserted into 
        the film for fans "in the know." What else would you expect from Bryan 
        Singer, the director of <i>The</i> <i>Usual</i> <i>Suspects</i>? The film's 
        storyline concerns a group of mutants-a new species that is the next step 
        in human evolution. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; These mutants have special powers that make them feared by 
        the general populace. As the government is trying to rid the world of 
        them, Professor Charles Xavier is training his mutant students to combat 
        evil and show that mutants are beneficial to society. To do this, they 
        must face off against a group of renegade mutants, who think the best 
        way to stop their persecution is to prove that they are better and stronger 
        than humans are. <b><br>
        Rated PG-13 </b></p>

        <i>The</i> <i>Phantom</i> (1996) <br>
        Directed by: Simon Wincer <br>
        Starring: Billy Zane, Kristy Swanson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Treat Williams, James Remar, Patrick McGoohan <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask around, you'll probably hear that this movie is 
        awful. Don't listen to those lies! This movie is great. It is right up 
        there with <i>Deep</i> <i>Blue</i> <i>Sea</i> as one of those movies that 
        was made to be serious, but when viewed as a comedy, it's top-notch. Some 
        of the lines in this movie are genuine classics. "Who are you?" "I'm Kit 
        Walker." "And who's Kit Walker?" "I am." It is so absurd and over-the-top; 
        you can't help but laugh. The performances in this film can't be beat. 
        You have Billy Zane (of Titanic fame), Kristy "I'm the real Buffy" Swanson, 
        a before-she-was famous Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Treat Williams in one 
        of the greatest performances as a villain ever. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The story involves a family of crime-fighters without super 
        powers (except for a magic ring). Every son in this family takes on the 
        role of the Phantom, so that it appears he never dies (hence his title 
        "The Ghost Who Walks"). In this story, The Phantom goes up against evil 
        tycoon Xander Drax, who is completely original and wants to rule the world. 
        In all actuality, the plot really doesn't matter. This movie is just fun 
        and silly, and everyone should see it. <b><br>
        Rated PG </b></p>

        <i>Batman</i> (1989) <br>
        Directed by: Tim Burton <br>
        Starring: Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Robert Whul, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Michael Gough, Jack Palance <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first and best entry in the modern Batman franchise 
        (we all know that it can't compare to the original, 1960's Batman, but 
        what can?). Tim Burton does a perfect job bringing the dark world of Gotham 
        to the big screen, and Jack Nicholson gives one of his finest performances. 
        Michael Keaton does great in a dramatic role, even though I do prefer 
        the Johnny Dangerously-era comedic Keaton. There are also great supporting 
        roles, especially Robert Whul and Billy Dee, who was able to take time 
        off from his heavy Colt 45 schedule to make this film as a personal favor 
        to Tim Burton. This movie is really great, and deserves a repeated viewing 
        by everyone. And if you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch 
        it. <b><br>
        Rated PG-13 </b></p>
