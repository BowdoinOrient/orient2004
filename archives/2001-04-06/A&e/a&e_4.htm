      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I sit, on the railing of Quinby House, observing the 
        most interesting ritual at Bowdoin, the Campus Wide. Tonight's theme is 
        quite ambiguous; it's just "Costume Party." This is dangerous, because 
        now every girl has simply far too many different ways she can hooch it 
        up for the night. And indeed, I believe that there are in fact too many 
        options and so she is forced to revert to, "Guys, I have such a funny 
        idea! I'm going to go as a hooker!" The number of times I have heard this 
        is truly unsettling. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, it's really weird how this always seems to 
        be a novel idea. And second of all, a hooker? A hooker. Guys, I am going 
        as a hooker. I think it's a really good idea to go as a hooker. I'm sorry, 
        but I cannot stress enough how funny I think this is. "I have a good idea, 
        and that good idea is to be a whore." Ah yes, brilliance. Innovative and 
        tactful. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, back to the party. There go a bunch of freshman 
        girls, who I guess are dressed as Reindeer…no, actually, no, on closer 
        look, Reindeer Hos. Of course. Girls in very small red tops, red mini 
        skirts, red heels and antlers. Another stroke of creative genius and- 
        Uh oh, one of them was from my Pre-O. Where do I go? Stairway…too...crowded...must…escape. 
        Oh NO. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Julianna!!! I-You-remember when we went kayaking? Ohhhhh 
        kayaking!!!" she screams.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh. Laurie. Hello." My god, look at you. "Yes, I in fact 
        do remember when we went kayaking." Six months is quite some time, understandable 
        how it might have slipped my mind. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "I am so embarrassed!" she says drunkenly staggering right 
        up to my face. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "You? No." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at my antlers! I have antlers, Julianna, antlers."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, so you do." Yes, you also have on just a red sequined 
        bra with matching stilettos. But if the antlers are what's getting you 
        down, then the antlers will be what's getting me down, because I am your 
        Pre-O leader, and I care about you. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Julianna, I have to tell you something. But it is a secret. 
        So don't tell him."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh no no no no no. Please don't ask me to set your Reindeer 
        Ho-ass up. "I won't tell him." I should walk away right now. Just go, 
        Julianna, she is very drunk, she won't even notice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "You're friends with Zed Fierce, right?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Blast it all! I knew this was going to happen. What do I 
        say? "No."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes you are, I've seen you have dinner before."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, Zed, yes of course. Thought you said 'Ted' and I mean, 
        who is named 'Ted', really? That would have been really weird. But you 
        said Zed, so I was wrong, not you. Silly me. Terribly sorry."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I thought this kind of I'm A Psycho blather was going to 
        have to keep falling out of my mouth until she lost interest, but luckily 
        I was saved by the return of the rest of the red-sequined herd, who all 
        gaped at my moccasin clad feet with a mix of disgust and wariness. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Laurie," said one. Perhaps this is Dancer? No no, definitely 
        Prancer, "If you don't go talk to Zed Fierce right now, I am going to 
        go instead."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, true friendship. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, Claudia, I was going to-but if you want to-it's not 
        a big deal, I-"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Jesus. Here is my chance to walk away, but how do I 
        let this social injustice continue? I already hate Claudia and she has 
        only said one sentence. This must be stopped.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, Laurie,"… am I really going to do this? Sigh. 
        Yes, yes I am… "I don't know how this escaped me (considering I remember 
        kayaking with you an entire six months ago) but Zed was actually just 
        asking about you, I'll take you over there."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You are so busted, Claudia. And I am so glad I finally get 
        to wield my sophomore power. This was a good decision, I am glad I did 
        not walk away. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I take Laurie over there, make introductions, "Zed, this 
        is a prostitute-I'm sorry-girl from my Pre-O trip. We kayaked in Maine, 
        you're from Maine, you guys can take it from there." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While I enjoy thwarting Claudia's evil, evil plans, I still 
        do not care to watch Zed "get his groove on." I really don't care to be 
        here at all, because quite frankly (and quite obviously) the fun of the 
        campus wide has worn off entirely. As a freshman I was sure that there 
        was no greater invention than the campus wide, and that I would go to 
        every single one until the day I graduated. However, somewhere along the 
        way I was like "Oh, bad beer, sweaty, sleazy men, many many hos doesn't 
        equal fun. Right."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But somehow, here I am on the stairs of Quinby House. I just 
        can't watch Zed comfort Laurie about her antler anxiety, so instead I 
        watch the rest of the herd trot off to take on another one of Bowdoin's 
        favorites, Wavis Tummings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Claudia has clearly set her sights on poor Wavis and is zeroing 
        in for the kill, when she is suddenly interrupted by the eerie silence 
        that lingers right before you hear "Life is a mystery, everyone must stand 
        alone, I hear you call my name, and it feels like…" dramatic pause as 
        every girl in the house readies themselves for the charge…"HOME!" Mad 
        chaotic rush to the dance floor, where everything is forgotten for four 
        minutes of Pure Girl Joy. Sorry, Wavis. </p>
