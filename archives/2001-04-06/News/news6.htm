      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A project is being undertaken by Friends of the Commons 
        to expand the Brunswick Town Commons by 95 acres to the south and 17.3 
        acres to the north. Famous to Bowdoin students as well as Brunswick residents, 
        the Town Commons is an ideal place to relax and exercise. With trail entrances 
        located behind the fields at Farley Field House, the current 80 acres 
        of land has come under developmental pressures in recent years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends of the Commons, a committee of Brunswick residents, 
        was established in 1999 with a goal of preserving and enriching the Town 
        Commons; since its creation, the committee has been planning and raising 
        money for the Town Commons Trail Project, a plan aimed at developing a 
        system of trails from the Bowdoin campus to the ocean. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the trails run from the edge of Bowdoin's 
        campus to Middle Bay Road, where it is possible to continue on to the 
        oceanfront. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the main focus is raising the $525,000 needed 
        to go ahead with the plan by the June 15 deadline. In strong support of 
        the project, the Brunswick Town Council is providing $225,000 in financial 
        aid, and the Land for Maine's Future program matched a grant of $150,000. 
        The committee was also able to collect $100,000 in donations and pledges 
        from local residents and other supporters. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with the help of two foundation grants 
        of $25,000 from the Dean L. Fisher Charitable Foundation and $12,000 from 
        the Fields Pond Foundation, a community-based nature and land conservation 
        organization, Friends of the Commons has come within $50,000 of their 
        goal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This total land expansion of 112 acres will help to 
        secure the preservation of the Town Commons as an integral part of the 
        Brunswick community. Also involved in the project is the Town Commons 
        Planning Committee, a group of town-appointed individuals responsible 
        for overseeing the care of the Commons. The committee is very interested 
        in engaging the Bowdoin community in the project.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Town Commons are so frequently used by Bowdoin 
        students; it's so nice to see, for instance, the cross country team out 
        on the trails training. The College is such an integral part of this project," 
        Barbara Desmarais, Chairman of the Town Commons Planning Committee said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundraising is scheduled to be completed in mid-June 
        and the transfer of property will immediately follow. For more information 
        on the project visit the Town Commons Planning Committee website at www.curtislibrary.com/towncommons 
        or the Friends of the Commons website at www.brunswicktrails.org/friendsofthecommons.htm.
