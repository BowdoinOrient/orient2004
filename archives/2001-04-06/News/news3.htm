      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past month, a student at Bowdoin was the target 
        of a peeping tom, who, after more than an hour of skulking outside her 
        windows, was detained by Brunswick Police and discovered to be a Bowdoin 
        employee. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 5, a female student had been playing basketball 
        at the Union and returned to Moore, her dorm, around 11:30 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, she noticed someone standing outside her 
        window, and because it was so snowy, she could not tell who it was. Initially, 
        she thought it was someone she knew, until she made eye contact with the 
        individual and he ducked behind a tree. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an "uneasy feeling," she closed the window shade 
        and left her room. When she returned, the peeper had repositioned himself 
        so he could look into her bedroom window. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was really nervous and called Security immediately," 
        she said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After pulling that shade, the peeper moved again so 
        he could see into the final window. Janie pulled all the shades, turned 
        off all the lights, and called Security again. Security then dispatched 
        the Brunswick Police who pulled over a car matching the student's description 
        and discovered that the alleged peeping tom was in fact a Bowdoin employee. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there, Bowdoin security officers conducted an hour-and-a-half-long 
        interview with the suspect. According to Director of Security Bruce Boucher, 
        the suspect "didn't deny he was in the area, but he wouldn't say what 
        he was doing." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following day, the suspect resigned and moved out 
        of state with no forwarding address. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No formal charges were pressed by local police because 
        there was not enough evidence to charge him with trespassing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Bowdoin Security is obligated to uphold a level 
        of confidentiality with the cases they handle, they did divulge the information 
        that the suspect was hired within the past few months and did not receive 
        a salaried position.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unclear whether the suspect had a prior criminal 
        background, or even if he did, whether Bowdoin would have been aware of 
        it when hiring him. The Bowdoin College Employee Handbook states that 
        "The College reserves the right to conduct investigations of personal 
        history in determining a candidate's qualifications for employment or 
        transfer. Such investigation may include obtaining a driving record report 
        or criminal background check…" but often the College does not exercise 
        this ability when hiring employees, especially unsalaried ones.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past four years, there have been five reports 
        of sexual assault, eight counts of aggravated assault, and 38 reports 
        of burglary for both on- and off-campus students.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Victims of sexual harassment or assault can either contact 
        Security by calling x3314 or Sexual Assault Services of Midcoast Maine's 
        24 hour hotline, 1-800-822-5999. </p>
