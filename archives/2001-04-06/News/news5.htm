      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newspaper advertisement designed to both apologize 
        for the social effects of slavery and argue against government-funded 
        reparations to black Americans has ignited firestorms of controversy in 
        many colleges across the country. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advertisement was sent to some college newspapers, 
        although it bypassed the newspapers of most liberal arts schools, including 
        Bowdoin. Although the advertisement has generally been met with a good 
        deal of debate, at some colleges, the advertisement has arrived and departed 
        very quietly.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advertisement is a list of ten reasons "why reparations 
        for slavery are a bad idea for black people--and racist too." It was written 
        and submitted by conservative columnist David Horowitz, who offered up 
        to $800 to 59 major college newspapers, including those at Florida State, 
        Columbia, the University of Virginia, Brown, and the University of Illinois, 
        to print the ad. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Horowitz's count, 35 papers chose not to run the 
        ad, 14 printed it, and 10 are still deciding. The advertising blitz was 
        focused on daily newspapers with a relatively large circulation in urban 
        areas; most liberal arts college newspapers, including <i>The Orient</i>, 
        have not been asked to sell space for it, although the <i>Dartmouth Daily</i> 
        received and declined to accept Horowitz's list.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horowitz is not a stranger to political controversy 
        following him to campus. In the 1960s, he edited a radical left-wing journal, 
        <i>Ramparts</i>. Throughout the 1970s, Horowitz made a well-documented 
        journey to the opposite side of the political spectrum.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a column written a few months ago, Horowitz wrote 
        about "the ugly iceberg of paranoia and hate that the political left--beginning 
        with Al Gore and Jesse Jackson and going on to Patrick Leahy and Ted Kennedy--has 
        recently planted in America's political heart." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rhetorically," <i>Salon</i> columnist Alicia Montgomery 
        says, "Horowitz has much more in common with rabble-rouser Al Sharpton 
        than he cares to admit." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horowitz's rhetoric is famous for its grittiness, and 
        it is his tone, not simply his ideas, that causes such a stir on campuses. 
        When he spoke at Berkeley last month, he shared the stage with 30 armed 
        campus police and two personal bodyguards. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the University of Wisconsin, the editors of the <i>Badger</i>-<i>Herald</i>, 
        which printed the ad on February 28, confronted 100 of their readers storming 
        the editorial offices demanding an apology for the decision. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spokesperson for Wisconsin's Multicultural Students 
        Coalition accused the newspaper as well as Horowitz of "exercising their 
        racism, their power to institutionalize their racism." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Brown, newspapers containing the ad were removed 
        by students and replaced with flyers objecting to the paper's decision 
        to run it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those protests have generated additional controversy 
        on campuses regarding freedom of the press. Horowitz has compared the 
        student protesters at Brown and Wisconsin to Nazi brownshirts, reminding 
        readers that "the Nazis took over universities first." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some editors, too, are responding forcefully to accusations 
        of racism and thefts of entire print runs by angry students. After all 
        but 100 issues of the <i>Brown Herald</i> were destroyed by student protesters, 
        the paper declared that "we will not apologize for printing a legitimate 
        advertisement that may offend some of our readership" and labeled the 
        theft of the print run "an unacceptable attempt to silence our voice."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, as students at the University of North Carolina 
        marched to protest the ad, Bowdoin remained unaffected by the controversy. 
        The issue of reparations for slavery has not been the subject of any recent 
        lectures or presentations here, said professors in the Africana Studies 
        and Government departments. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new book in favor of reparations by Randall Robinson 
        entitled <i>The Debt: What America Owes To Blacks</i> has been ordered 
        by, but not yet delivered to, Hawthorne-Longfellow Library. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the <i>Orient</i>--along with weeklies at most small 
        liberal arts colleges--has, so far, been left alone. </p>
