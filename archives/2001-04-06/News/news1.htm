      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rolling blackouts throughout California and the 
        high heating costs in the Northeast this year have once again put a spotlight 
        on the state of energy in our nation. The spotlight is hitting Bowdoin 
        College, too, as energy expenditures rise on campus with no certainty 
        of when oil prices will level to a more accommodating cost. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partly as a result, the Trustees of the College have 
        decided to increase next year's tuition by five percent, compared to last 
        year's increase of four percent, raising further questions of just how 
        serious the energy situation is on campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with Bowdoin's annual budget of $90 million, only 
        $2.25 million is devoted to costs for utilities such as heating and electricity. 
        For the first time, utilities are running up a $300,000 deficit for the 
        fiscal year, and their budget is now approaching close to $2.5 million. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unexpected deficit is the result of the primary 
        oil called "#6 fuel," which has risen in price from $20 per barrel last 
        year to a current $30 per barrel. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fuel is a very thick oil that is first heated and 
        then burned in the Central Heating Plant to supply energy to academic 
        and many residential buildings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is purchased from Maine Power Op tions, a non-profit 
        electric co-op out of Augusta that supplies low-cost power to non-profit 
        organizations, colleges, and universities throughout Maine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Bowdoin pays six to seven percent less for 
        its oil than it would otherwise pay if it did not purchase through Maine 
        Power Options. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the cost of #6 fuel increased by 50 percent 
        as it did this year, that single-digit discounted rate was not of much 
        significance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only are members of the College's budget committee 
        concerned about the increase in the cost of the fuel, but the increase 
        in its consumption has also become a growing concern. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rick Parkhurst, assistant director for Properties and 
        Budget Administration, said that because of recent major construction 
        and renovation projects, there are more buildings to heat than ever before. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, over the past five years, the College has increased 
        its purchase of #6 fuel by 6.8 percent to cover the additional energy 
        demand for the extra buildings. Both the rising cost of oil and the increase 
        in consumption on campus have contributed to the budget deficit. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerald Boothby, associate vice president and director 
        of budgets and associate treasurer, said that regardless of the utility 
        budget deficit, tuition is not going to be affected, at least not because 
        of the high energy costs. It is not yet enough of a financial impact on 
        the College for that consideration to be made.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the possibility of future utility deficits, natural 
        gas has been considered as a possible long-term substitute for #6 fuel 
        if the pattern keeps up. However, natural gas prices have also increased 
        dramatically-to the point where a comparable barrel of natural gas is 
        more than twice the price of #6 fuel, and natural gas is not as power-efficient 
        as the oil. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Parkhurst, natural gas provides 85 percent 
        of the power that #6 fuel offers, and even when natural gas was less expensive 
        than #6 fuel, the Administration still needed to purchase more natural 
        gas to compensate for its lower power return. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With #6 fuel, Parkhurst said, you get "the most bang 
        for your buck." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, after consideration, the prospect of using 
        natural gas was easily dismissed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is just a matter of waiting for prices to drop, 
        since the cost of energy is beyond the control of the Administration. 
        However, the College does have control over consumption.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With academic buildings such as Searles Hall fully illuminated 
        on a Saturday night, and with dorm lights left on all day, high energy 
        consumption is something that the College community has the ability to 
        change. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boothby said, "Energy conservation, especially in the 
        Northeast, needs to be aggressive, and not complacent." Otherwise, what 
        may have been seen as a brief moment in the energy spotlight could turn 
        into an energy crisis. </p>
