      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin students Jared Hickman '99, Andrew Mountcastle 
        '01, and Isabella Sarkisyan '01 have been awarded Thomas J. Watson Foundation 
        fellowships, allowing them to pursue independent research projects while 
        traveling outside the United States for one year after their graduation 
        this year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarkisyan's project is entitled "Bridging Borders: Young 
        People Building Peace." She will be travelling to five divided societies: 
        Northern Ireland, South Africa, Cyprus, Macedonia, and the Republic of 
        Georgia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of her research is to explore the unique 
        role of young people in peacebuilding and how particular initiatives such 
        as peace camps, coexistence workshops, dialogue groups, and bi-communal 
        projects encourage the next generation to break the cycle of violence 
        and prejudice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarkisyan said, "I believe that young people have an 
        enormous potential for peacebuilding because they are still young enough 
        to experience profound psychological and perceptual changes, yet mature 
        enough to understand the importance and difficulty of the challenges they 
        face."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mountcastle's project is entitled "The Cultural Response 
        to Whale and Dolphin Strandings." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his Watson Fellowship, Mountcastle will study the 
        cultural response to whale and dolphin strandings in several countries, 
        including the Azores Islands (Portugal), Scotland, the Faroe Islands (Denmark), 
        Norway, and New Zealand. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His research will involve exploring the relationship 
        between the scientific and public sectors of a community as they deal 
        with the issues that arise from marine mammal strandings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will be conducting research in affected communities 
        and through local marine conservation organizations, stranding networks 
        and research institutions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hickman's project is entitled "The Magic Worldview of 
        Latin American Folk Catholicism." He will be traveling to Spain, Portugal, 
        Italy, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Bolivia.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty fellowships were awarded to college seniors across 
        the country, and this year's Thomas J. Watson Fellows will travel to more 
        than 90 countries on six continents while investigating topics like the 
        design of roller coasters, the classification of tropical frogs, monastic 
        gardens, craters of Australia's outback, the role of youth in peacemaking, 
        racial constructs among the deaf, Tuvan throat singing, dolphin and whale 
        strandings, and the international art market.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, more than 1,000 students from 50 selective 
        private liberal arts colleges and universities applied for these awards. 
        Students must first be nominated by their college or university and then 
        compete on a national level. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watson Fellows will each receive $22,000 for their year 
        of travel and study. This year of travel provides Fellows an opportunity 
        to take stock of themselves, test their aspirations and abilities, pursue 
        their own in-depth study, and develop a more informed sense of international 
        concern.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thomas J. Watson Fellowship Program was created 
        in 1968 by the children of Thomas J. Watson, Sr., the founder of IBM Corporation, 
        and his wife, Jeannette K. Watson, to honor their parents' long-standing 
        interest in education and world affairs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program identifies prospective leaders and allows 
        them to develop their independence and to become world citizens. Watson 
        Fellows span academic majors from physics to fine arts, and 20 percent 
        of them are minorities.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 2,300 Watson Fellows have gone on to become 
        college presidents and professors, CEOs of major corporations, politicians, 
        artists, lawyers, diplomats, doctors, and researchers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We look for bright, creative, independently-minded 
        individuals who have the personality and drive to become leaders," says 
        Tori Haring-Smith, executive director of the Watson Fellowship Program 
        and a former Watson Fellow. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Watson Foundation continues to believe that the 
        investment in Watson Fellows is an effective contribution to the global 
        community. </p>
