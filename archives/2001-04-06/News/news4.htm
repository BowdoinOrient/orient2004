      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major gift from an anonymous donor will endow a new 
        professorship at Bowdoin College. The $1.5 million gift will establish 
        the A. Myrick Freeman Chair in Social Sciences.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endowment recognizes Freeman for his outstanding 
        contributions to scholarship and teaching during his 36-year career at 
        Bowdoin. Susan E. Bell, department of sociology and anthropology, has 
        been named the first A. Myrick Freeman Professor in Social Sciences.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bowdoin College deeply appreciates this extraordinary 
        gift," said Robert H. Edwards, president of the College. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The donor recognizes that endowed chairs are hallmarks 
        of a truly distinguished faculty. Funds from the endowment will provide 
        support for compensation, research, teaching expenses, and sabbatical 
        leaves. The gift will greatly enhance and forever enrich the study of 
        the social sciences at Bowdoin."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Myrick Freeman is the William D. Shipman Research 
        Professor of Economics at Bowdoin College. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received his Ph.D. in economics from the University 
        of Washington in 1965, at which time he was named to the Bowdoin faculty. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired from the teaching faculty since 2000, he also 
        served as chair of Bowdoin's economics department and director of the 
        environmental studies program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freeman's principal research interests are in the areas 
        of the economics of environmental policy, applied welfare economics, benefit-cost 
        analysis, and risk management as applied to environmental and resource 
        management issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of his work has been devoted to the development 
        of models and techniques for estimating the welfare effects of environmental 
        changes, such as the benefits of controlling pollution and the damages 
        to natural resources due to releases of chemicals into the environment. 
        His most recent research has been on methods for estimating the economic 
        value of ecosystems and their functions and services.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has been the author or co-author of eight books including 
        <i>The Economics of Environmental Policy</i>, <i>The Benefits of Environmental 
        Improvement</i>: <i>Theory and Practice</i>,<i> Air and Water Pollution 
        Control</i>: <i>A Benefit-Cost Assessment</i>, and <i>The Measurement 
        of Environmental and Resource Values</i>:<i> Theory and Methods</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also published more than 70 articles and papers 
        in academic journals and edited collections.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susan Bell, professor of sociology, specializes in sociology 
        of health and illness. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Susan is a model of the scholar/teacher at Bowdoin, 
        devoted to her students and to rigorous teaching, while continuing wide 
        engagement as a scholar particularly interested in individual narratives 
        about illness and in the development of medical technologies," said Craig 
        McEwen, dean for academic affairs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, Susan has continued to translate 
        science and medicine for a wider audience with her continuing contributions 
        to new editions of Our Bodies, Ourselves, one of the most significant 
        books of the last several decades. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She is a wonderful choice to be the first occupant 
        of the A. Myrick Freeman Chair in Social Sciences."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bell's research involves the experience of illness, 
        women's health, and visual and performative representations of the politics 
        of cancer, medicine, and women's bodies. She came to Bowdoin in 1983 and 
        has served as chair of the department of sociology and anthropology. She 
        has taught courses in constructions of the body, sociology of health and 
        illness, and current controversies in sociology.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graduate of Haverford College, where she now serves 
        on the Board of Managers, she received her master's degree and doctorate 
        from Brandeis University. She was a post-doctoral research fellow in sociology 
        in the department of psychiatry at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center 
        of Harvard Medical School.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wrote the birth control chapter for the 1984 edition 
        of <i>The New Our Body, Ourselves</i>, and revisions for the chapter in 
        the 1992 and 1998 editions (<i>Our Bodies, Ourselves for the New Century</i>). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other recent publications include "Empowering technologies: 
        connecting women and science in microbicide research" (<i>Sciences Sociales 
        et Sante</i>), "Experiences of illness and narrative understandings" in 
        <i>Perspectives in Medical Sociology</i>, "Narratives and lives: Women's 
        health politics and the diagnosis of cancer for DES daughters" (<i>Narrative 
        Inquiry</i>), and "Events in the Tuskegee Syphilis Project: A Timeline" 
        in <i>Tuskegee's Truths</i>: <i>Rethinking the Tuskegee Syphilis Study</i>. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been awarded the Kenan Fellowship for Faculty 
        Development at Bowdoin (July 1998-June 2001), a National Endowment for 
        the Humanities Summer Stipend, a Grant-in-Aid from the American Council 
        of Learned Societies, and a National Research Service Award from Harvard 
        Medical School. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a member of the American Sociological Association 
        and International Sociological Association. <br>
