      <p align="left"><font size="5">Smokers take a hit</font></p>
      <p align="left"> In New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg is attempting 
        to curb cigarette smoking. Following in the footsteps of Los Angeles and 
        many other California counties, the Mayor has proposed a ban on smoke 
        in bars, restaurants, pool halls and bowling alleys. While there are many 
        supporters, a large population in the Big Apple disagree and insist that 
        Mr. Bloomberg's proposal challenges their constitutional liberties.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        Barry Mills does not have that problem. President Mills announced in a 
        September 5 email that &quot;smoking is no longer permitted in any college 
        building, including all student residence halls, apartments, and the College 
        Houses.&quot; It is likely that the only opposition he will have is the 
        small assembly of campus smokers. A majority of the Bowdoin population 
        does not smoke and is against first and second hand contact. However, 
        the majority of smokers will not be affected by the school's new policy.<br>
        Depending on housing and roommate situations, many will puff away without 
        bothering others. Undetected by security, smokers will most likely continue 
        without change in various social houses (however, many have instituted 
        policies of their own), Coles Tower, and the apartments.<br>
        President Mills writes, &quot;College survey data indicate that while 
        very few of our students arrive on campus as smokers, a significant number 
        become smokers while here.&quot; The largest component of his statistic 
        is first-years. Here, smokers and non-smokers can be paired together with 
        conflicting habits. Seeing a close friend constantly smoking can either 
        repel or draw in the non-smoker, very often the latter.</p>
      <p align="left">The most important and effective aspect of this new policy 
        is Dudley Coe's gratis counseling and &quot;tools for quitting.&quot; 
        Nicotine patches are readily available after an appointment with the health 
        center staff, a confidential and highly effective instrument. It is important 
        that the college has recognized the great risks of smoking, not only in 
        thought but materially. Just as safe-sex talks will not provide for students 
        already engaging in unprotected intercourse, regulations against dormitory 
        smoking will not curb smokers' trends. However, the open, advertised availability 
        of proven addiction-breakers can immediately affect those trying to quit.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Studies show that the number of students who become 
        addicted to cigarettes during their four years at college can be decreased 
        by 40% just by making college residence halls smoke-free,&quot; said President 
        Mills. It would be interesting to concentrate on the value of making freshman 
        halls smoke-free as this is the most (and perhaps only) effective area 
        for the new rules. Undoubtedly, the pressure on first-years to isolate 
        their habits and eventually cease them will influence the trend as they 
        progress through their four years here. </p>
