      <p align="left"> Well, we had quite a summer, didn't we? Vicious heat waves, 
        economic bad behavior, and of course the usual barrage of stupid summer 
        movies. Unfortunately, the audiences continue to consume this bubbly, 
        pointless, summer slush faster than a buttery bag of popcorn. And for 
        what, I ask you, for what?</p>
      <p align="left">For recycled ideas and mindless sequels that Hollywood can 
        get away with because we just keep paying to see them.</p>
      <p align="left">This summer was full of mostly forgettable flicks and I 
        won't waste my time talking about those because, well, I've forgotten 
        them. But I am going to talk about the summer films that stay with you 
        (even if it's for all the wrong reasons). There's no way I could do all 
        of them justice, but here's a few good examples. </p>
      <p align="left">Scooby-Doo was the first truly mindless summer blockbuster. 
        I've always had respect for the cartoon, but who in the world thought 
        of putting it on the big screen? Not a shred of this movie made sense. 
        The cast was made up of teeny bopper allstars who, regardless of their 
        acclaimed acting skills, seemed to have some trouble working with a blue-screen 
        animated dog. Perhaps they were thrown off because it looked about as 
        real as the Pillsbury Doughboy. </p>
      <p align="left">Now we move to a colorful sequel which also happens to double 
        as this year's bad Will Smith movie. There was something eerily un-patriotic 
        about releasing Men in Black 2 on Independence Day weekend. Burger King's 
        MIB Happy Meal toys kept me more entertained than this. And again, I had 
        respect for the original idea. Men in Black was really funny-Will Smith 
        and Tommy Lee Jones looked like they had fun doing it. But here, Tommy 
        looks like he's ready to kill himself. Maybe it's because he realized 
        at some point during production that release of the film might ruin his 
        career. </p>
      <p align="left">Animal Planet had a quick-serve movie idea up its sleeve 
        this summer too. Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course is the flick based 
        on Australian madman Steve Irwin's misadventures. Whose bright idea was 
        it to have this guy act? I would've accepted some documentary style film, 
        but of course that didn't make it onto the big screen. What did make it 
        onto the big screen was a makeshift plot in which (I can barely even write 
        it) Steve Irwin saves the world. Now that is just ridiculous. </p>
      <p align="left">I know what you're thinking: what about Spiderman and Star 
        Wars: Episode 2? My answer to you is this: May isn't summer yet. Those 
        don't really count. And then you'll say, what about Minority Report, Road 
        to Perdition, and Signs? And I'll say, yeah, I'll give you those. Any 
        or all of those three may be up for Best Picture. But three in three months 
        is bad. Real bad.</p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps the only redeeming factor about the summer movie 
        season is getting to see the trailers for the fall movies-the good fall 
        movies which we hope will totally rule. </p>
      <p align="left">So, as your life gets more hectic, remember that the movies 
        only get better. They're out there for two reasons: to entertain you and 
        to enlighten you. And I'm here to let you know which movies do that and 
        to what degree-and if the outcome is worth your precious time and money 
        then stay tuned.</p>
