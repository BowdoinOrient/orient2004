      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">In his convocation address, President Mills exhorted faculty 
        as well as students to seek out knowledge in disciplines other than their 
        own. The need for such interaction was unintentionally, but vividly, displayed 
        in the speech given by physics professor Madeline Msall.</p>
      <p align="left">In her speech, Professor Msall claimed that differences 
        in human behavior, in part because they are multidetermined and cannot 
        lead to concrete &quot;laws,&quot; are inappropriate for scientific study. 
        What Professor Msall failed to acknowledge is that it is exactly this 
        complexity that motivates social and behavioral scientists. By insinuating 
        that social and behavioral scientists do not adhere to the model of building 
        theoretical hypotheses and generating strong tests of their predictions, 
        Professor Msall indicated a lack of understanding of our fields. At best, 
        these comments were careless. At worst, they constituted a severe criticism 
        of the work conducted by a quarter of her colleagues at Bowdoin.</p>
      <p align="left">It is true that an individual's decision regarding how to 
        act in a given situation is determined by a multitude of forces. Genetic, 
        chemical, and physiological factors play roles, as do characteristics 
        of the situation, cognitive processes, and the developmental history of 
        the person. In their classes, the developmental psychologists in our department 
        encourage students to move beyond the false dichotomy of nature versus 
        nurture implicated in Professor Msall's argument, to appreciate the interdependent 
        and reciprocal ways in which biological and environmental processes act 
        together to determine behavior. Such an approach, involving collaboration 
        between the natural, social, and behavioral sciences, lends strong insight 
        into the human experience.</p>
      <p align="left">Professor Msall's comments regarding the social and behavioral 
        sciences were especially surprising, since she noted early in her speech 
        that following the scientific method holds promise for conquering problems 
        such as racism and poverty. Through the use of scientific methodology, 
        economics professors at Bowdoin predict the responses of consumers, government 
        professors at Bowdoin enhance our legislature's ability to evaluate policy 
        to alleviate social ills, and sociology professors at Bowdoin study processes 
        critical in the design of programs to combat racism and sexism. <br>
        Because a primary purpose of her speech was to encourage female undergraduates 
        to consider careers in science, it is particularly troubling that she 
        chose to dismiss fields in which the numbers and prominence of women equal 
        or surpass men. By suggesting that scientists are defined by whether or 
        not they wear white coats, Professor Msall did a disservice to the legions 
        of psychologists, sociologists, economists, political scientists, and 
        anthropologists who happen to be women. If her goal was simply to encourage 
        young women to study the natural sciences, then it seems to us that the 
        social and behavioral sciences need not have been mentioned by her at 
        all, or at least not discussed in a pejorative way.</p>
      <p align="left">Paradoxically, Professor Msall asserted that social forces 
        have played a strong role in discouraging young women who show promise 
        in science from fulfilling this potential. Presumably, Professor Msall 
        arrived at this belief through her (perhaps limited and selective) exposure 
        to social science. It is equally ironic that she used the science of cognitive 
        psychology to put forth her claims about the nature of everyday problem 
        solving with all the conviction that this science warrants. Thus, Professor 
        Msall appears to dismiss, or at best diminish, behavioral science while 
        at the same time using findings from this science to support her thesis. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">It would have been helpful if Professor Msall had, at the 
        outset of her talk, put forth her formal and explicit definition of science 
        itself. If, as she suggested, her criteria of scientific inquiry include 
        the ability to generate universal causal laws and to predict with one 
        hundred percent certainty the outcome of any individual case, then we 
        are left to wonder whether many areas of inquiry in biology, chemistry, 
        and even physics meet her criteria.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Consider medical diagnostic tests. Though few are 100 percent accurate, 
        they still help us find hidden medical problems. <br>
        Sensitivity measures how often such tests give correct warnings. A test 
        with 80% sensitivity correctly identifies 80 of every 100 people who have 
        the medical problem. But we also hope to avoid falsely &quot;diagnosing&quot; 
        people who are problem-free. Specificity measures how often tests produce 
        negative results, among problem-free people. Clearly, useful tests are 
        both sensitive and specific. <br>
        Here's a puzzle. Suppose a symptom-free virus appears among 10 percent 
        of adults; the corresponding test has 80 percent sensitivity and 80 percent 
        specificity. When someone receives a positive test result, what is her 
        true probability of having the virus: 30 percent? 57 percent? 80 percent?<br>
        This puzzle relates to work done by several groups of scientists. Medical 
        researchers who develop diagnostic tests qualify, as do epidemiologists 
        who track pathogens across populations. Physicians using diagnostic tests 
        in clinical practice function, in some ways, as scientists.<br>
        Social and behavioral scientists also qualify. In studying how people 
        interpret test results, they pursue the same fundamental scientific goal 
        Professor Msall described in her Convocation address: finding general 
        laws that explain observed regularities of events.<br>
        Social and behavioral scientists also use the same intellectual tools 
        any scientist uses: logic, open procedure, observation and measurement, 
        controlled experimentation, specialized language, and mathematics. To 
        be sure, we go about our tasks in distinctive ways. Few observers would 
        mistake basic economics for basic psychology, either field for physics, 
        nor any of these fields for epidemiology or medicine. But beyond particularities, 
        our fields embrace in common the methodology of science, and for the same 
        reason: because it works. <br>
        Psychologists recently presented the virus puzzle to several samples. 
        77 percent of undergraduates answered incorrectly. So did 50 percent of 
        senior scientists at the National Institutes of Health. So did 68 percent 
        of practicing physicians. <br>
        Disturbing findings such as these lead social scientists to work hard 
        - really hard - studying human reasoning, and through theory formulation 
        and hypothesis testing, finding its origins. In fact, social and behavioral 
        sciences study all domains of human affairs. Why? Because behavior has 
        important consequences: who wants to hear she has an 80 percent chance 
        of carrying a virus, when the true probability is 30 percent? But we also 
        are inspired by the abundance of fascinating, accessible questions about 
        the human condition. Slowly but surely, through research guided by the 
        principles of science, we find answers. You are welcome to join us.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
