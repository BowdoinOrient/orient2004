      <p align="left"> The school gathered both in prayer in the chapel, as well 
        as a community in Morrell Gymnasium to commemorate the one year anniversary 
        of September 11. In a similar fashion, the Brunswick Area Interfaith Council 
        held a noontime prayer service for the college and town of Brunswick at 
        the First Parish Church, and the school was again called to join together 
        for a panel discussion at 8:00 pm in Pickard Theater.</p>

      <p align="left">Although the discussion filled only about 2/3 of the theatre, 
        it was perhaps the greatest The panel brought together Dorcas Gilpatrick, 
        Associate Director of the Maine Chapter of the Civil Liberties Union; 
        Laurence Pope, Former US Ambassador and member of the Bowdoin College 
        Class of 1967; Brig. Gen. Joseph Timkham, Director of Homeland Security 
        for the State of Maine; and Dov Waxman, Assistant Professor of Government 
        at Bowdoin.</p>
      <p align="left">Barry Mills began the discussion by telling the community, 
        &quot;I was very proud of the college that day.&quot; Mills went on to 
        say that he believed that rather than &quot;relive the painful events 
        of that day,&quot; he had decided to &quot;bring thoughtful people together&quot; 
        to discuss issues which continue to be relevant in an academic setting 
        in light of the terrorist attacks. Following these remarks, Craig Mc Ewen, 
        Dean for Academic Affairs, and acting as moderator, introduced Pope as 
        the first speaker.</p>
      <p align="left">Pope believed that, although the military response was &quot;a 
        justified one, Washington far too often uses military force as a first 
        rather than last resort.&quot; Pope went on to note that the &quot;balance 
        of power is tilted towards the radical wing. These are perilous times 
        and [with the current military action] we are riding for a fall.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Waxman, next to speak, centered his commentary on refuting 
        the claim that &quot;the world has changed.&quot; He went on to dispel 
        five points made about September 11th, which he believed to be incorrect. 
        Waxman disagreed with the assertion that globalization would change, that 
        the Bush administration would work with Allies, and that the world would 
        retreat to isolationalism. Rather, Waxman contended that changes, especially 
        economic ones, in America are due more to &quot;executives at Enron&quot; 
        than the events of September 11. He also emphasized that, not unlike during 
        the Cold War, America still considers the world &quot;in 'us and them' 
        terms,&quot; and that &quot;the movement toward unity has quickly evaporated.&quot; 
        Although Waxman noted that the world has not changed, he emphasized that 
        we &quot;should not take comfort in continuation with the world which 
        created 9/11.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Timkham, the next to speak, focused more on the domestic 
        changes since September 11, particularly in the state of Maine. He concentrated 
        on the &quot;hundreds of vulnerabilities&quot; which were found in the 
        state of Maine, and how security has changed to address many of these 
        problems. He concluded by mentioning that Maine will be receiving government 
        funds in the next year to increase security, and that funding will be 
        felt throughout the state. </p>
      <p align="left">The final speaker, Gilpatrick, voiced her concern &quot;of 
        what would happen to our civil liberties.&quot; She went on to say that 
        the Bush Administration is &quot;completely contemptuous of the law&quot; 
        in its detainment of 1,200 Americans, who have yet to be accused of any 
        crime, for investigation. She also touched upon some new initiatives of 
        the Bush administration, including the American Patriot Act, which she 
        believed were inappropriate. Gilpatrick concluded her commentary by warning 
        &quot;don't trust the government when they say 'trust us, we'll do the 
        right thing', they won't, and history tells us so.&quot;</p>
