      <p align="left">probably noticed the presence of something new (and no, 
        it's not because the cross country team is doing more midnight laps). 
        Lining the inside of the fishbowl on the first floor of the VAC is a graphic 
        combination of black and white images that comprise a new mural: &quot;Dedicated 
        to our mothers.&quot; <br>
        Designed by senior art majors Todd Forsgren and Eric Legris, the mural 
        features naked figures in a variety of poses and sizes combined with animals 
        and randomly selected portraits taken from none other than the freshman 
        face book. </p>
      <p align="left">Though these images easily demand the attention of any passerby, 
        their meaning is a bit more difficult to discern. &quot;We enjoy the fact 
        that the murals are cryptic,&quot; said Eric of his work. &quot;We want 
        people to bring their own interpretations to the paintings. We don't think 
        it's important to define them absolutely.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">With the hopes of maintaining an open space in which to 
        interpret their murals, Eric and Todd were reluctant to specify much further 
        on the source of their inspiration. However, they did tell me that the 
        murals reflect a certain mythology: a combination of art historical references, 
        mythical figures, and the Bowdoin experience in general. These ideas work 
        in conjunction with a desire to welcome first-year students to campus. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;The freshmen are a fresh population of students,&quot; 
        said Eric, &quot;and we hope that they won't feel constrained by a somewhat 
        conservative campus. Our mural is a little more provocative than other 
        things in the fish bowl. It has a lot of passion and that's a metaphor 
        for what we feel the Bowdoin community can offer.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The idea for the mural, which was started before classes 
        began this fall, grew organically out of Eric and Todd's collaborative 
        work while on campus this summer. Eric had been studying the figure while 
        Todd had been modeling for some local artists. They were both interested 
        in painting the figure and began with that idea in mind. </p>
      <p align="left">After getting permission to design the mural by Professor 
        Mark Wethli of the visual arts department, Eric and Todd began to brainstorm 
        ideas for something that would grab the attention of incoming first-years 
        and upperclassmen alike. However, nothing was planned absolutely. Besides 
        completing some preliminary sketches, Eric and Todd worked mostly from 
        the mural itself, adjusting it as it grew larger and became more detailed. 
        &quot;It incorporates the image of a Greek pot,&quot; they told me, &quot;and 
        anything can go on a Greek pot.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">As for the sexual nature of the paintings, Eric and Todd 
        did not intend them to have shock value. However, they did admit that 
        they had gotten plenty of wild responses to their work. &quot;So far our 
        best critics have been kids biking by and saying things like 'that is 
        some messed up animal sex,'&quot; explained Todd. </p>
      <p align="left">Ironically, most of the Bowdoin students that have approached 
        Eric and Todd about the mural have been less distressed by the sexual 
        content than by the idea of painting first-year faces on a wall that occupies 
        such a prominent position in the center of campus. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;If I came to campus as a freshmen this year and saw 
        my own face up on a wall I would probably think it was pretty weird,&quot; 
        said Bethany Dittmar '03. However, if your face does appear on the wall, 
        do not worry. Eric and Todd assured me that the faces were picked randomly. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;We chose pictures that had good composition. Sometimes 
        we needed someone looking to the right or to the left because that would 
        lead the viewer's eyes more deeply into the mural. We also tended to choose 
        people who looked like they had submitted quintessential high school graduation 
        pictures. In addition, we wanted photographs that had good resolution.&quot;<br>
        Eric and Todd also invited other artists to help them complete the portrait 
        section of the mural. Donating their hands and talents to the efforts 
        were seniors Alex Noznick and Lauren Adams. &quot;We wanted to get different 
        styles involved,&quot; said Eric. However, no matter how many different 
        styles and talents are featured in the fishbowl, their marks upon its 
        walls are temporary. In three weeks the mural will be painted over and 
        the presence of all brushwork will disappear as room is made for new exhibitions. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, if you happen to take a gander from Pickard to the tower 
        in the next couple weeks, be sure to stop by while the mural is still 
        there. It may be a long time before anything in the fishbowl hangs quite 
        like this. </p>
