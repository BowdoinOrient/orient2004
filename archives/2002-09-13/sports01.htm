      <p>Man, she's hot. Dude, she's got it going on. In fact, she's looking real 
        good. <br>
        We're not talking about a model-we're talking about an athlete. Sports 
        marketers demand that women be both athletes and sex symbols; strong, 
        swift, sexy, and seductive comprises the prime formula. While men just 
        have to perform on the field, women must perform at a high level and look 
        good doing it too.</p>

      <p>Sexism in the media's coverage of women's athletics is abundant, blatant, 
        and journalistically acceptable. If you dont believe me, scan through 
        any major sports publication and absorb the salient aspects of each article 
        that concentrates on women. Sex appeal is often first and foremost, while 
        athletic talent is a close second.</p>
      <p>For example, Serena Williams graces the cover of August 19 edition of 
        ESPN Magazine. The number one ranked women's tennis player is dressed 
        casually: white tank top, trendy jeans, earrings, and a fancy watch. Her 
        blonde-dyed hair is blowing freely and she's flashing a confident smile.<br>
        So what? She's in great shape and deserves to strut her stuff; she's worked 
        hard for her body.</p>
      <p>But, try to imagine number one ranked mens tennis player Lleyton Hewitt 
        on the cover of ESPN in a trendy outfit with his hair blowing in the wind. 
        Or how about Shaq? Manny Ramirez? Kurt Warner? Its comical - they're athletes!</p>
      <p>I dont want these guys to be trying to look sexy on the cover of a magazine. 
        I want to admire them as athletes.</p>
      <p>In ESPN's feature story on Serena, eight photos of the tennis star appear. 
        In only three of them is she actually playing tennis. In the other photos, 
        the magazine chooses to focus on feminine beauty. My favorite is of her 
        straddling one of those huge bouncy balls. Can't you just see Drew Bledsoe 
        in a similar photo shoot?</p>
      <p>Isn't there something wrong with this picture? We see more cleavage than 
        coverage of her tennis exploits.</p>
      <p>ESPN prefaces the article by admitting that, &quot;Answering questions 
        while a makeup artist's tweezer is yanking wild hairs out of your eyebrows 
        is not the easiest way to give an interview.&quot; But, hey it's no sweat 
        for the &quot;hottest act in tennis!&quot; I wonder if Roger Clemens ever 
        got his eyebrows plucked before an interview.</p>
      <p>In addition to this stellar work, ESPN Magazine also included an article 
        about the Lady's Professional Golf Association (LPGA). The headline? Style 
        Council.</p>
      <p>Evidently, the LPGA has become style-conscious and is looking for ways 
        to boost their ratings. The league hired a panel of fashion specialists 
        to coach the women golfers not on their swings, but on their fashion.<br>
        Trish McEvoy, who is described as a &quot;makeup queen,&quot; demands 
        that the women &quot;be critical. Looking good is discipline.&quot; In 
        other words, stop being lazy and focusing so much on being a great golfer-you 
        gotta dress with some spunk if you want to get noticed!</p>
      <p>At least the article ends on an upbeat note. Natalie Gubis, a 19-year-old 
        phenom, says, &quot;I want my skirts shorter next year! Its too hot to 
        wear long, clingy skirts.&quot; I cant wait until Tiger Woods replaces 
        his silk slacks with something a little more revealing&#133;</p>
      <p>To be fair to ESPN Magazine, they are not the only media outlet that 
        capitalizes on common gender stereotypes and exploits feminine beauty 
        to sell a sport. The Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) once 
        used the slogan &quot;We got next!&quot; to advertise the new, upcoming 
        league.<br>
        After struggling to garner a sufficiently large audience, the focus has 
        changed. Now, the league proudly announces, &quot;Basketball is Beautiful.&quot; 
        Beauty has forever been associated with women and it sells, so why not 
        market a sport with this proven technique? Chamique Holdsclaw averaged 
        19.9 points, but let's not talk about her game-let's talk about her beauty 
        because basketball really is beautiful. </p>
      <p>Basketball is tears, blood, sweat, and hard work. Aspects of the game 
        are beautiful, but its not a dance-bodies are banging, hands are clutching 
        and grabbing, and wills are tested. Take one good look at the sweat dripping 
        from Patrick Ewings forehead at the free-throw line and tell me if basketball 
        is beautiful. He sweats so much that he changes his jersey at halftime. 
        <br>
        Or how about the elbow-swinging, fight-instigating scrappy play of a Bill 
        Lambier? Are you telling me that's beautiful too?</p>
      <p>Instead of exploring original and thought-provoking techniques, marketers 
        and journalists alike continue to rely on age-old stereotypes. The media 
        must critically assess its coverage of women's sports and stop exploiting 
        the female form to improve the game's marketability.</p>
      <p>While it may increase profits in the short-run, it hurts the credibility 
        of women's athletics long-term. </p>
      <p>Oh, by the way, Serena Williams just won her third straight Grand Slam 
        by defeating her older sister, Venus Williams, in convincing fashion. 
        Only six women have previously accomplished this feat.</p>
      <p>Now, can we focus on the sport? </p>
