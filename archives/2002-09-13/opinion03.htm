        <font size="2">TODD BUELL<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Scott Simon recently mentioned on NPR's &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; 
        that American popular culture has reverted to its pre-9/11 fascination 
        with superficiality. Anyone who has recently been to Shop 'N Save knows 
        that the popular magazines seem enamored with Matthew Perry's struggle 
        out of rehab, Oprah's apparent weight gain, and the news that Lance Bass 
        will, at least for now, remain earthbound. </p>
      <p align="left">A year ago it was thought that the sooner we got back to 
        our tabloid fascinations or popular diversions, the easier it would be 
        to cope with the stark horror that was September 11, 2001. In the weeks 
        that followed 9/11, many social commentators thought we could gauge our 
        national health by the amount of time it took for us to start caring again 
        about comedy, music, movies, and sports. </p>
      <p align="left">When President Bush threw out the first pitch at Yankee 
        Stadium prior to Game 3 of the World Series, he confirmed that baseball 
        was not only our national pastime, but also that it could serve as national 
        therapy in times of severe crisis and uncertainty. </p>
      <p align="left">Following 9/11 we were unified as a country. Flags lined 
        our streets, people gave blood, thousands of young men and women volunteered 
        for the Armed Forces, The Peace Corps, Teach for America, and other service 
        organizations. The Congress voted overwhelmingly to give the President 
        military authority in Afghanistan where we have since defied all expectations 
        in rebuilding that country. </p>
      <p align="left">In the early months after 9/11, we made every necessary 
        attempt to ensure that another attack would not happen again. National 
        Guard troops patrolled our airports, F-16s were on call to thwart another 
        hijacking, and we maintained our resolve even in the face of biological 
        attacks. Passengers also aided an airline crew to stop &quot;shoe bomber&quot; 
        Richard Reid as he intended to blow up a transcontinental flight. As a 
        nation we appeared ready and willing to engage in a permanent &quot;war 
        on terrorism.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Yet I worry today that our spirit is waning. We have become 
        too complacent-too willing to step back into our comfortable, hermetically 
        sealed, climate-controlled &quot;September 10&quot; world. Our determination 
        to do everything possible to protect ourselves has diminished. </p>
      <p align="left">Just this week, the Senate finally passed a law permitting 
        pilots to carry handguns in the cockpit. The delay surrounding this basic 
        step in bolstering airline security defies explanation. Though I understand 
        concerns about the security of the gun and the risk of a bullet puncturing 
        the plane's wall, there is no doubt that a gun in the cockpit would have 
        delayed if not outright thwarted the 9/11 hijackings. As an airline pilot 
        friend of mine told me, every passenger trusts his life to the pilot when 
        he steps on board an aircraft. So why wouldn't he trust a pilot (who probably 
        has military training) to use a gun properly? </p>
      <p align="left">There is much reason to be concerned about the state of 
        airline security, and that concern is not only in the cockpit, but also 
        before one even boards the aircraft. Last week, The New York Daily News 
        sent reporters onto planes in eleven different airports, including Logan 
        Airport and Washington Dulles airport (both airports from which 9/11 hijacked 
        flights departed), to measure the effectiveness of airport security. Regrettably, 
        these latter-day &quot;muckrackers&quot; successfully smuggled knives, 
        boxcutters, and other verboten devices onto the plane. Instead of admitting 
        the mistake and improving security, the feds are threatening to prosecute 
        the reporters for violating security procedures. </p>
      <p>Though it is unlikely that Al-Qaeda will strike again in the exact same 
        manner as they did a year ago, it is still imperative that we make every 
        effort and take every precaution to keep our skies safe. Demonstrating 
        effective security serves as a deterrent to all forms of terrorism, not 
        just attacks on airplanes. We are loathe to forget that Osama Bin Laden 
        felt safe in pursuing the attacks on 9/11 because he sensed weakness in 
        our resolve to fight back. </p>
      <p>Ensuring that sensitive points in our national infrastructure are secure 
        is perhaps the most peaceful method in which we can combat terrorism. 
        It is reactive and not preemptive; it protects us without harming innocent 
        people. <br>
        That is why we as a people should be especially outraged that our country 
        is failing such basic security tests. The recent arrest of a couple in 
        Germany planning to bomb a military base on September 11, 2002, should 
        show us that there are still people in the world who want to harm us. 
        It is our duty as a country to keep ourselves safe, if for no better reason 
        than to preserve our right to watch Oprah and root for the Red Sox. </p>
