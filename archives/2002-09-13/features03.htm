        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As the stock market plummeted this summer and fears of 
        a double-dip recession began to surface with continued slow economic numbers, 
        investors and the public started to look for something, or someone to 
        take their frustrations out on. This movement led the public to focus 
        on corporate wrongdoing. The media seemed to focus its unrelenting eye 
        on this issue, as it became the hot topic for almost any news show.</p>
      <p align="left">Executive after executive was brought up on charges having 
        to do with &quot;interesting&quot; accounting practices, such as Bernie 
        Ebbers of WorldCom, Dennis Kozlowksi of Tyco, Martha Stewart... Martha 
        Stewart? Stewart is on the verge of being brought up on charges of insider 
        trading (trading securities on non-public information) and obstruction 
        of justice. Stewart is being accused of selling her 4,000 shares ImClone 
        on inside information that the FDA was going to rule on ImClone's latest 
        drug, Erbitux obtained through conversation with ImClone CEO Samuel Waksal 
        or other ImClone officials. To make matters worse, Stewart then may have 
        lied about the circumstances surrounding her sale of the stock to the 
        SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) in an attempt to save herself.</p>
      <p align="left">It may just be me, but it seems a little strange that Martha 
        Stewart is being accused of these crimes. When I think of Martha Stewart, 
        I think of this woman on the television either planting something in an 
        already perfect garden or in a kitchen making something that looks so 
        good, so exquisite that if it were made of manure I would still eat it. 
        Thousands of people around the country try to replicate what she does 
        in the home and garden. Martha Stewart isn't exactly the type of person 
        that comes to mind when I am thinking of insider trading and obstruction 
        of justice. When I think of insider trading, I think of, for example, 
        the Oliver Stone movie Wall Street, where some hot shot investor is taken 
        down on insider trading violations. I do not tend to think of a woman 
        that has her own home and garden show.<br>
        I understand that I may sound a little sexist and stereotypical in my 
        argument, but that is because I probably am a little of both. However, 
        I would not be as shocked if it were almost anyone else in this situation. 
        What really confuses me is how one can go from baking cookies or planting 
        tulips on a very popular TV show to serving time in the joint. For those 
        of you who do not think Stewart would not go jail because of her celebrity 
        status, think again. Obstruction of justice and insider trading are very 
        serious crimes. Stewart, although she may not end up serving 20 years 
        to life in Leavenworth, it is more than a possibility that she would serve 
        some amount of jail time if convicted of these crimes.</p>
      <p align="left">Maybe I shouldn't be as perplexed by this whole situation 
        as I am. After all, Stewart is the chairman and chief executive of her 
        own company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. However, I do believe 
        she is known more for her ability around the house than her ability in 
        a board room. <br>
        The funniest thing about Stewart's whole situation is that it seems that 
        the general public is ready to put her in the slammer, even without a 
        trial. It sounds as if most people want to throw her in a cell and toss 
        away the key. Why out of all the people who have committed corporate crimes, 
        does Martha Stewart take the majority of the attention? It is almost as 
        if the general public would find it amusing to see someone such as Martha 
        Stewart behind bars. I know I would.</p>
