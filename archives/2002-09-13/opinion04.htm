        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> With America's War on Terrorism, nasty corporate scandals, 
        and the election of 2000 in the back of everyone's mind, it is not surprising 
        to find that a recent Harvard study on the attitudes of college students 
        done by Erin Ashwell (et al), showed that of the students currently enrolled 
        in college 69 percent believe that community volunteerism is the best 
        way to address national problems; only 27 percent believe in the power 
        of political engagement. </p>
      <p align="left">In the last presidential race, this was obvious, with the 
        lowest turnout of 18 to 24 year-olds in the history of presidential elections. 
        This is a staggering statistic, considering people in this age bracket 
        make up one third of the eligible voting population. Those who crunch 
        these numbers have concluded that members of the millennial generation 
        just don't care about the issues that plague our nation. They have written 
        us off as dead weight to our civic society. Their sentiments are well 
        taken but egregiously flawed.</p>
      <p align="left">Members of the millennial generation volunteer at higher 
        rates than any other generation, including those of the greatest generation. 
        This strange phenomenon of beliefs is known to most as the &quot;service 
        gap&quot;. Almost 90 percent of college students believe that volunteering 
        in the community is more productive than political involvement. </p>
      <p align="left">Young people today do care, but they don't see the connection 
        between what they see happening in their communities and what they see 
        happening in our capital. The connections between politics and community 
        have been hidden from clear view, and because of this, many of today's 
        youth have lost faith in our political system. This is a dangerous situation 
        for us all. The reality is that every bit of community service that is 
        performed by this generation is specifically linked to a piece of public 
        policy made by those who either don't care, who are led by their own special 
        interest, or those who have lost their original idealism to fight for 
        social change. As a generation that obviously cares about the condition 
        of our nation, we must step up and lead it into a new era of leadership. 
        Where are all the real politicians? I would argue that they are either 
        working for your local non-profit, homeless shelter, or close closet. 
        They are the ones on your college campus who can't seem to sit still on 
        the issues that affect our greater society. This generation is not short 
        on concern or leadership and is able to lead our nation further. This 
        is made obvious through organizations like AmeriCorps, City Year, and 
        most specifically United Leaders. United Leaders's sole mission is to 
        &quot;inspire our generation, the Millennials, to pursue honorable careers 
        in political service by involving them in politics as a means for social 
        change.&quot; They aspire to connect 18-24 year olds with the tools, resources, 
        support, and network necessary for them pursue careers in political service. 
        Their goal is to inspire a generation of United Leaders dedicated to revitalizing 
        American politics.&quot; Once barriers of entry into politics, such as 
        those that are financial and our own generational disenchantment, for 
        young, virtuous leaders is addressed and eliminated through groups such 
        as this, then we will be able to tell those who are truly motivated to 
        bring about change from those whose motives are to promote self and special 
        interest. However, until the time arises when we can see our political 
        leaders for what they really are, I have this one special request- Will 
        all the real politicians please stand up?</p>
