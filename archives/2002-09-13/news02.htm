      <p align="left">The Outing Club has moved from its old headquarters upstairs 
        in Smith Union to a state-of-the-art building of their own at the junction 
        of College Street and Harpswell Road. The new building houses all of its 
        equipment, formerly stored in the basements of Appleton Hall and Burnett 
        House, and it is also now cataloged in a database built by CIS programmer 
        Ron Kay. The Schwartz Outdoor Leadership Center also features a library/map 
        room, a kitchen, and offices for director Mike Woodruff, assistant director 
        Stacy Kirschner, and student officers. The building also contains trip 
        lockers, bathrooms, and a huge central hall with a fireplace, in which 
        the Outing Club prepared for its annual pre-orientation trips in late 
        August under the watchful eyes of a gigantic moose head.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The most obvious improvement is the efficiency in 
        getting trips out in the field,&quot; said Woodruff. &quot;We were really 
        a day ahead in our preparation for pre-orientation.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The Schwartz Outdoor Leadership Center cost 1.25 million 
        dollars. Construction started last November and the building opened in 
        June. Planning started in December 1998. Associate Dean of Student Affairs 
        Tim Foster chaired a committee including Emily Hinman, Rich Mrazik, and 
        Jeremy Morse '99, Kim Christensen '97, and Megan Hayes and Allie Binkowski 
        '03. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Dean Foster's perseverance and guidance was instrumental 
        in the successful completion of the project,&quot; said Woodruff.<br>
        Architect Rich Renner of Van Dam &amp; Renner Architects of Portland was 
        hired and Wright-Ryan was the contractor on the project. The OLC was built 
        on the former site of the BowdInn Bed &amp; Breakfast. <br>
        The building is named in honor of Steven M. and Paula Mae Schwartz, who 
        were the lead donors for the project. Steven is a member of the Class 
        of 1970, a trustee of the college, and an avid trekker and ocean kayaker. 
        He serves on the board of the directors for the Appalachian Mountain Club. 
        The Schwartzes are founders of Schwartz Communications, a PR agency for 
        high-tech companies based in Waltham, Massachusetts. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're lucky that we have alumni such as Steve Schwartz 
        who recognize the value of outdoor pursuits within the context of a liberal 
        arts education and who possess the vision and generosity to make this 
        facility a reality,&quot; Woodruff said.</p>
      <p align="left">The OLC was built with &quot;green construction&quot; in 
        mind. Windows were placed to take maximum advantage of natural light to 
        reduce energy usage. The building has no air conditioning, it is naturally 
        ventilated. Radiant floor heat and efficient glazing in the windows are 
        other green features. <br>
        Couches, benches, and rocking chairs should be coming soon to the central 
        hall. Woodruff wants the hall to be &quot;a community space&quot; for 
        BOC members. The fireplace, which is to be named in honor of James S. 
        Lentz, the first full-time director of the Outing Club, will be used in 
        colder weather where members could enjoy &quot;s'mores on the fire.&quot; 
        The moose was donated to the OLC by Dr. Michael Jones '77, father of Josh 
        Jones '04.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The moose was actually shot about 30 years ago in 
        Alaska, while [my dad] was on a hunting trip there. Until now it had been 
        in my grandparents' home in Concord, MA. I told Mike Woodruff I could 
        get a moose in the new building for more of a Maine feel. If you visit 
        any of the old hunting and fishing camps in the state, they always have 
        a few deer and moose on the wall,&quot; said Jones.</p>
      <p align="left">The moose is joined by a stuffed animal polar bear in paddling 
        gear that looks down on the room from the inflatable raft in the rafters. 
        Additionally, Ivan Spear '44 has donated two pairs of snowshoes from Labrador, 
        which he brought back from one of Donald MacMillan's expeditions that 
        he went on, and a caribou skin kayak from the same trip, which will be 
        on permanent loan from the Worcester Academy. The snowshoes and kayak 
        will be on display in the OLC soon.</p>
      <p align="left">The new building also provides a space where the Outing 
        Club can host speakers, receptions, classes, and seminars. The Outing 
        Club's first speaker of the year will be Alex Laden, who soloed the Inside 
        Passage from Alaska to Seattle. She will speak on September 19 at 7 p.m. 
        in the OLC. The building will be dedicated on October 18 when Jill Fredsten, 
        an avalanche expert who has rowed over 25,000 miles inside the Arctic 
        Circle, comes to speak. On November 6, the OLC will host Tom Mailhot, 
        who rowed across the Atlantic, and the Chewonki Foundation will hold ecology 
        and natural history seminars in the building on November 9. In addition, 
        on November 14, Fal de Saint Phalle, Bowdoin Class of 1968, who walked 
        across the United States, will speak.</p>
      <p align="left">Woodruff, Bowdoin Class of 1987, said the opening of the 
        OLC, the BOC's first building of its own, has been the biggest leap forward 
        for the Outing Club since the hiring of Lentz in 1984. Before, the club 
        was completely student-run and was erratic in popularity.</p>
