      <p align="left"> The blades spun swiftly in the cloudless sky as the sound 
        of well-oiled motors broke the salty, humid air of the Indian Ocean. Slowly, 
        like a hawk riding in the heat of the afternoon sun the Marine helicopter 
        banked towards the waiting vessel below. The light gray chopper glanced 
        once up towards the horizon and for a split second the motor-blades sliced 
        the sun, blocking the rays. The chopper - a CH-46E Sea Knight - crested 
        once above the aqua blue ocean, tilted slightly and then landed gently 
        on the black and white tarmac of the moving ship.</p>
      <p align="left">Quick, systematic motions swung the doors of the chopper 
        open. Heavy, humid, salted ocean air mixed with the pungent aroma of jet 
        fuel and heated tar brushed into the cockpit as the pilot powered down. 
        The blades slowed and from half a dozen spots on the flight deck of the 
        ship, men and women, superbly trained in their tasks ran out with supplies 
        and designated duties. A Marine officer stepped off the Sea Knight, shouldered 
        his gear and walked out, completely aware of his surroundings, knowing 
        every inch of the flight deck that had been his home for so many months. 
        Another Marine stepped off, adjusted his sunglasses and followed the first. 
        Without a complaint, as if the hundred-degree heat were as cool and soothing 
        as a New England spring morning, the rest of the Marines emptied out of 
        the chopper. Their weapons put away, they strolled below decks, past corridors 
        filled with their comrades. The sound of their combat boots against the 
        steel of the ship's metal floors was a familiar tune to the men and women 
        of the crew.<br>
        As the men walked, knowing that their training mission had been yet another 
        successful one - a training mission that would continually make them deadlier 
        and more efficient for the cause of their country - they felt a certain 
        pride that one can know only if one has survived the worst places on the 
        planet with his fellow comrades. They turned down a hall towards their 
        quarters, knowing by instinct and routine exactly where each room in the 
        ship's organized maze lay. One by one they passed a plaque bolted with 
        militaristic precision and patriotic care to one of the ship's walls. 
        On it were words of stirring power - words of militaristic beauty, strong 
        political words used over and over again to stir the imaginations of young 
        men and women to fight. Beneath the words there was also mention of the 
        ship's proud name - U.S.S. Peleliu.</p>
      <p align="left">From afar she looks like an odd duckling; while not quite 
        a battleship, she is also not quite an aircraft carrier. She is in fact 
        an amphibious assault ship, capable, like the other members of her class, 
        of transporting America's best from one hot zone to another. Her flight 
        deck is the proud base for a wide array of transport and fast attack weapons 
        - both choppers and aircraft. Of the almost three thousand crew a large 
        number of them are members of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, proud 
        elite soldiers of a proud and elite army. The Peleliu stretches over eight 
        hundred feet from stem to stern and displaces almost forty thousand tons.</p>
      <p align="left">Closer still to the Peleliu and one can see her beauty. 
        Like a great white shark in the undisturbed sea, she cuts through the 
        water, knowing full well that she is the master of her domain. She houses 
        some of the most powerful weapons and the most determined men and women 
        in the world. Aside from the fact that she is a veteran member of the 
        U.S. Pacific Fleet, she is also very capable of bringing to any corner 
        of the earth's seven seas the might and the will of the American people. 
        On and below her decks thrives a fully functioning city of soldiers and 
        sailors who have come to know the taste of the North Pacific in the morning 
        air and the sweltering heat of her burning sun at the strike of noon. 
        She has served many captains and many presidents but all along she has 
        been the proud bearer of only one flag - the Stars and Stripes. From her 
        decks members of the armed forces staged Operation Enduring Freedom and 
        struck a blow for liberty.</p>
      <p align="left">In that recent operation, the landing craft that were housed 
        beneath Peleliu's great mass were not used in combat but rather sat, awaiting 
        a time when men will have to, once again, storm beaches under fire. Since 
        the advent of the precision missile, fewer opportunities have developed 
        for the use of the all out amphibious assault. And yet Peleliu's own name 
        links her to that form of military strategy employed so often at the cost 
        of so many good men in a time of great darkness.</p>
      <p align="left">More than one person has wondered where the name &quot;Peleliu&quot; 
        comes from. Here, in fact, is where the story truly begins. Before there 
        was an amphibious assault ship, before there was the Marine Corps Super 
        Cobra and Sea Knight, before there were satellites and laser-guided missiles, 
        there were the proud rugged men of the First Marine Division - &quot;the 
        Old Breed&quot; - who, one morning in the fall of 1944, stormed a small 
        island on the road to the Philippines: the island of Peleliu.</p>
      <p align="left">Today she is not much to look at, this once hostile and 
        bloody island. She remains a lot like she did in the days before the Marines 
        came and before the Japanese came. Nature has made her stronger, in fact. 
        Her coral reefs remain sharpened by the endless waves that crash against 
        her sandy beaches and her overgrown forests. Still here, from the days 
        before man, there are ridges and rocks and trees that have known no danger. 
        From the seashore, instead of the floating, decaying bodies of once proud 
        and patriotic men, there are crabs that crawl up into the coconut forests 
        and deeper into the vine covered woods. From the beach one can climb slowly, 
        trying to avoid the roots of the trees that still jut from every direction, 
        ready to catch the unaware and the unprepared. Slowly the humidity rises 
        and even though the light from the sun is blocked by the dense brush the 
        island heat will soon turn the air into a virtual oven. All around there 
        are shades of different green - a distant reminder of the horrible days 
        when shades of red splattered the island and the screams of wounded and 
        dying men filled the air which now ring only with the buzzing of flies 
        and mosquitoes.</p>
      <p align="left">Somewhere inland there is a small hill and a rise. Above 
        the trees and above the damp, soft floor of the forest covered with vines 
        and leaves the hill takes you to the top where a simple memorial marks 
        the men who lost their futures on this piece of rock in the South Pacific.</p>
      <p align="left">There are still remnants of that great battle long ago. 
        There are still shell casings, masks, Japanese buildings and vehicles, 
        long since destroyed and long since adopted by the island as shelter for 
        creatures of all types. Even the coveted runway, which was what brought 
        the Allies to this island in the first place, still remains, although 
        somewhat ill maintained. Everything that had survived the battle seems 
        to be decaying in the damp, hot Pacific sun. But above the trees and on 
        the hill there is a clearing and monument attesting to the valor and the 
        memory of the men who did not walk away from this engagement. There stands 
        amidst the tides of the Pacific and rolling hurricanes that slash at the 
        islands' wind swept beaches a granite stone, marking the spot where so 
        many brave men fell.</p>
      <p align="left">For the Marines Peleliu was a bad memory, but still she 
        was a victory. In 1980, decades after the guns of World War II had been 
        silenced by the sounds of millions of others across the conflict-ridden 
        twentieth century there was a ceremony once again honoring the men who 
        had served their country in the hills and jungles of Peleliu - the U.S. 
        Armed Forces were naming a ship in their honor.</p>
