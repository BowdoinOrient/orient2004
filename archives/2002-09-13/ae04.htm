      <p align="left">Apparently they can. Art in America, The New Yorker, Art 
        Forum, and Sculpture/Modern Forum were there, as were a host of Bowdoin 
        alums and faculty. On August 28, at the Plane Space Gallery in New York 
        City, an exhibit featuring the artwork of John Bisbee opened in Soho. 
        The show will last until October 4 at a gallery that is run by Bowdoin 
        grads Chad McDermid and Bryson Brodie.</p>
      <p align="left">Plane Space is not the only gallery to have displayed Bisbee's 
        creations. The sculptor has also had shows at the former Seafirst Gallery 
        in Seattle, the Albright Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, and the Kemper Museum 
        of Contemporary Art in Kansas City. He plans to have another exhibit next 
        summer at the DeCordva Museum of Art in Lincoln, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps the reason that so many galleries have been interested 
        in Bisbee is because of the electrifying energy that each of his works 
        exudes. Like a bundle of trapped energy, Bisbee's art mirrors the same 
        enthusiasm that the artist possesses himself when talking about his work. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">After fifteen years of working with nails, he is still delighted 
        by the craft and does not plan on stopping any time soon. &quot;It's fascinating 
        that I can work with one thing,&quot; he said, &quot;everything opens 
        up, the options become endless.&quot; <br>
        Even when using nails alone, Bisbee still manages to create tremendous 
        variety within his work. In fact, the current exhibit reflects a vast 
        array of different shapes and designs. Symmetrical spheres of pointy nails 
        lie next to a long winding path of spikes. A melted bunch of nails stick 
        straight up in the air. One can't help but wonder how he does it. Bisbee's 
        answer: &quot;It's who I am, it's what I do.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">It took him 13 months of daily, consistent work to craft 
        the sculptures in his current exhibit. It was certainly worth it; Bisbee 
        deems this exhibit &quot;the best so far.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">When asked how he feels about the end of a project, Bisbee 
        said, &quot;It's always a letdown. It's a strange thing to empty yourself 
        out and have this manifested residue-nothing can match the effort.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Fortunately, many viewers will continue to appreciate his 
        efforts. His innovative use of everyday substance speaks to artists and 
        non-artists alike. &quot;The one thing I love about visual art is that 
        I don't have to talk about it,&quot; Bisbee said. Photos of Plane Space's 
        exhibit prove that he's right. With their intricate contortions and captivating 
        patterns, Bisbee's sculptures do all the talking. </p>
      <p align="left">The show won't be traveling anywhere, but students can see 
        some of Bisbee's work at the faculty gallery section of the Bowdoin website. 
        Bisbee also has a studio at Fort Andross in downtown Brunswick for those 
        willing to venture beyond the Bowdoin quad. </p>
