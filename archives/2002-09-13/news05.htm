      <p align="left"> For nearly a year now, the eastern edge of the Quad has 
        been dominated by caution tape and construction equipment. What began 
        as precautionary maintenance has become a complete rebuilding project. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;Constantly we're looking around to see the condition 
        of the buildings,&quot; says acting Director of Facilities Management 
        David D'Angelo, &quot;we try to catch problems before they become serious.&quot; 
      </p>

      <p align="left">D'Angelo outlined a four-step process that the College follows 
        in construction projects on campus; beginning with &quot;conceptual design&quot;--the 
        administration seeks to understand the situation and its challenges to 
        formulate a goal. This is followed by &quot;schematic design&quot;--the 
        creation of a logical means of achieving the stated ends. The &quot;development 
        process&quot; is outlined next, and is followed by a continual refinement 
        process that seeks to acquire accurate budget statements and cost expectations. 
        D'Angelo placed the current project in the refinement stage, currently 
        completing a preventative measure to help the towers weather the winter. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;Stage 1 will be done in October sometime--probably 
        late October--netting will be up with stainless steel bands every ten 
        feet or so,&quot; says Shawn Smith, on-site project head from H.P. Cummings 
        Construction. &quot;Then, in March, the netting will be taken down, and 
        the stones will each be numbered, removed, and stored.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">What brought this about? Weather-related spalling was beginning 
        to force pieces from the outer granite wall to protrude from the towers 
        and even caused several to fall altogether. The science behind the problem 
        is simple--moisture seeps through cracks in the mortar holding the carved 
        stones together and expands with the freezing temperatures in the winter, 
        forcing the blocks from out of their positions. </p>
      <p align="left">The towers are twelve feet on a side with three-foot-thick 
        walls. Only the outer foot of carved granite stone will be removed, leaving 
        the interior two feet intact. H.P. Cummings is responsible for the initial 
        scaffolding construction and preventative measures for the coming winter. 
        The firm, founded in 1879, is responsible for many other recent renovations 
        on campus, including the Moulton Union terrace repairs last summer, as 
        well as the Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, Searles Science Building, and 
        Walker Art Building dome renovations. The firm was also involved in the 
        construction of Wish Theater and has done work on college campuses throughout 
        the East, including Middlebury College. The College is reviewing several 
        proposals for the second stage, including two separate plans from H.P. 
        Cummings involving two different masonry partners. </p>
      <p align="left">The second stage will begin in March and involves the stone 
        removal and rebuilding for the North Tower. Work will begin on the South 
        Tower the following March. D'Angelo realizes that this can't necessarily 
        be a strict timetable, when budget concerns and schedules are still up 
        in the air to some extent.</p>
      <p align="left">The Chapel has been a part of Bowdoin's campus for most 
        of the College's existence. Built in the 1850s under the supervision of 
        architect Richard Upjohn and opened in 1855, it has long been an impressive 
        monument to Bowdoin's strong sense of tradition. </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin College President Barry Mills noted that, &quot;The 
        chapel is an incredibly important building on the Bowdoin campus and in 
        the state. When you are the keeper of a historic building, it is your 
        responsibility to maintain it. We look forward to returning the chapel 
        to its former splendor.&quot; <br>
        Student reaction has been characterized by disappointment at the concealment 
        of the towers, but is tempered by the project's necessity. <br>
        &quot;I think it's a necessary renovation,&quot; says Ryan Boutin, '05, 
        &quot;it's not [about] what it looks like now, but what it will look like 
        in the end.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Now, after a century and a half, the renovations are seeking 
        to preserve that tradition for future Bowdoin students through a completely 
        new beginning for the towers. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Hopefully, when we're done, this will last another 
        150 years,&quot; says Smith. </p>
