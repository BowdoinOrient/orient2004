        <font size="2">CONOR WILLIAMS</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">As a young high school senior back in Michigan, I was warned. 
        &quot;You're going east for college? Don't you know what they're like 
        out there?&quot; Some were particularly scathing: &quot;If you come back 
        saying 'wicked,' I'm going to kick the shit out of you.&quot; </p>
      <p>It was made abundantly clear to me that all easterners were effete, arrogant, 
        and spoiled rotten-prep-school products and particularly vociferous in 
        their opinions, New Englanders in particular. So understand, I'm a product 
        of a rampant Midwestern inferiority complex. </p>
      <p>Now, let me be straight with you-after a year of Bowdoin, while I've 
        certainly had moments that confirm the damning criticisms, they're not 
        true. That is, for the most part. <br>
        Let me be blunt-you guys simply don't know football. Independent of Bowdoin's 
        historical struggles on the gridiron, there just isn't the same grassroots 
        football enthusiasm here. On any given day, it's common that the quad 
        will be filled with Frisbee and whiffleball games. </p>
      <p>Pickup football? It's a pretty rare commodity. Whiffleball? Honestly, 
        I can't figure it out. </p>
      <p>In Michigan, the state practically drops everything three times every 
        fall: Michigan State vs. Michigan, Michigan vs. Notre Dame, and most of 
        all, Michigan vs. Ohio State. For that reason, I'm in mourning, as the 
        Wolverines just dropped a big one to Notre Dame. <br>
        We live, die, sweat, and cry with our teams, and the NFL is no different. 
        Whether it's the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field or the blistering winds 
        of Soldier Field, football is mythical. </p>
      <p>Remember Saturday Night Live's Chicago superfans? Well, they're real, 
        and they exist just like the Packers' astronomical twelve NFL titles. 
        Except for the Bears, who've taken nine, nobody's even close. </p>
      <p>More importantly, let's remember the 1986 Super Bowl, when the Bears 
        and Patriots met in the Super Bowl, and the &quot;Monsters of the Midway&quot; 
        smoked the Patsies like a joint, 46-10. </p>
      <p>They were the toast of the nation, with &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle,&quot; 
        William &quot;The Fridge&quot; Perry, and Walter Payton. </p>
      <p>That kind of enthusiasm is just missing here. The Pats won the Super 
        Bowl, and within days, everyone quietly went back to their studies, back 
        to hockey, back to whiffleball. Where's the fire? </p>
      <p>Let's quote some more numbers-the University of Michigan has more wins 
        than any other college team, followed closely by Notre Dame. In spite 
        of the recent Florida impingement (I question if their flighty offensive 
        game is really football), Heartland teams dominate the sport unequivocally. 
      </p>
      <p>Just take a look at the conferences-the Big Ten and Big Twelve are the 
        true hotbeds of football strength. Nebraska, Oklahoma, Michigan, Ohio 
        State, Notre Dame, and Texas constitute the class of the NCAA. With the 
        addition of the Florida sunshine frolickers, those teams routinely complete 
        the top of the ranking lists year in, and year out. </p>
      <p>So perhaps, with all of this evidence before me, I should've realized 
        that Boston College's Eagles were the biggest fish in the Eastern football 
        pond north of the Mason-Dixon. Somehow it just didn't occur to me that 
        there was such an overwhelming void. </p>
      <p>Students here follow the Red Sox for 162 games with more enthusiasm than 
        was mustered for the Patriots last year until the last few playoff games. 
        Meanwhile, Chicago was in absolute chaos waiting to see if the Bears would 
        continue their remarkable season. It just doesn't seem right. </p>
      <p>Now this isn't to question the toughness, or the virility of New England 
        or her inhabitants&#133;you guys have rugby and lacrosse, sure. Soccer's 
        a great game, and the student body here seems pretty talented compared 
        to what I'm used to. <br>
        Still, it's a little odd to be sitting down alone for the game, whether 
        it's the Pack and Bears, or Oklahoma and Texas. </p>
      <p>I mean, seriously-who plays whiffleball? </p>
