      <p align="left">Change is afoot in the world of music. A crop of quite excellent 
        rock and roll bands have appeared on the horizon of popularity, an alluring 
        oasis in the desert of absolute crap that dominates radio and MTV. There's 
        many (there is never a drought of good music, you just need to know where 
        to look for it), but the ones who the spotlight and hype have attached 
        to have been, in chronological order, the Strokes, the White Stripes, 
        the Hives, and the Vines. Major label scouts are scouring the streets 
        of New York City and Stockholm as you read this.</p>
      <p align="left">The Vines are one of the few groups that doesn't hail from 
        New York City or Sweden. They're Australian. If you can't tell the difference 
        between the Vines and the Hives, the Vines are the ones that made the 
        cover of Rolling Stone, with the completely insane lead singer who smashed 
        his bassist's wrist at the VMAs. </p>
      <p align="left">Lest you think that there is no difference between the Vines 
        and the Hives, check out the Vines' debut LP Highly Evolved. The secret? 
        Only a third of the tracks are in the Nirvanaesque vein of the single 
        &quot;Get Free.&quot; Songs like &quot;Mary Jane,&quot; &quot;Homesick,&quot; 
        &quot;Autumn Shade,&quot; and &quot;Country Yard&quot; drift along lazily 
        in 1960s psychedelic pop territory. They're simple, blissful, excellent 
        tunes. Lead singer Craig Nicholls may be obsessed with Nirvana, but he's 
        also obsessed with the Beatles. The Vines actually made their debut on 
        U.S. shores much earlier this year with a cover of &quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot; 
        on the I Am Sam soundtrack. </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, Nicholls complains about touring, wanting to record 
        the next three Vines albums before going out on the road again, truly 
        becoming highly evolved. (Locking himself in a studio for a couple of 
        years would probably be a lot better for his health - fueled by constant 
        supplies of Red Bull and weed, this guy loses his mind on stage).</p>
      <p align="left">This is no simple garage act. The Vines might be the most 
        ambitious new band since Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis stepped onto 
        the music scene in 1994 and declared that theirs was the best band in 
        the world. And like Oasis, they've got the goods. Of course, it can't 
        hurt that their lead singer might be the most entertaining frontman in 
        rock since Jim Morrison.<br>
        Highly Evolved is an incredible debut. On the Strokes' Is This It, every 
        song is high quality, but the Vines' sonic palette puts the Strokes to 
        shame. <br>
        You've got melodic, psychedelic pop like &quot;Homesick,&quot; my favorite 
        song on the album; you've got irresistibly catchy punk nuggets, including 
        &quot;Get Free&quot; and &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; and of which &quot;Ain't 
        No Room&quot; shines the brightest; and you've got the in between: &quot;Factory,&quot; 
        a pleasant tune with ska beats, &quot;Sunshinin,&quot; a blink-and-you-miss-it 
        rave-up, and &quot;1969,&quot; a stomping epic that combines everything 
        before culminating in a glorious howl of noise to end the album.</p>
      <p align="left">In other words, Highly Evolved is just about perfect. Album 
        of the Year honors will probably still go to the Chili Peppers, who have 
        much better lyrics (the Vines' biggest weakness) but these Aussies will 
        give SoCal's finest a run for their money. </p>
      <p align="left">Here's hoping that Craig Nicholls doesn't kill himself like 
        his idol did before his Vines have a chance to evolve some more.</p>
