      <p align="left">This past weekend was a busy one at the BOC, with all of 
        our trips going out at maximum capacity. In fact, most of the trips filled 
        up early last week, leaving some disappointed people on the waiting list. 
        Even though we had to leave some behind, all of the trips had a great 
        time. The highlight of last weekend was the overnight trip to Baxter State 
        Park. This trip filled up by mid-day Monday, and the lucky ones, blessed 
        by the weather, climbed to the summit of Mount Katahdin, the highest mountain 
        in Maine. We also sent out an overnight Flatwater Canoe trip to Lake Umbagog, 
        a Climbing day-trip, and another crazy Whitewater trip to the Dead River. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for this weekend, there will be two day-trips going out. 
        On Saturday, Megan Hayes and Gia Upchurch will lead a fearless group of 
        Sea Kayakers out onto the wild waters of Casco Bay. Sunday, a Flatwater 
        Canoe trip will introduce its participants to some of the beautiful rivers 
        and lakes of Maine. Both of these activities, Sea Kayaking and Canoeing, 
        only have a few weeks left in their season. Be sure to get out soon!</p>
      <p align="left">There are lots of great trips planned for next weekend. 
        We have two spectacular overnights both leaving on Friday, and several 
        great day trips. If you missed Katahdin last time, be sure to get to the 
        OLC early on the 23rd to sign-up for the final Katahdin weekend of the 
        semester. There will also be a Whitewater overnight going to the Rapid 
        River. If you have ever read Louise Dickenson Rich's book We Took to the 
        Woods, this is the river it takes place on!! And if you haven't read it, 
        you should. On Sunday, there will be a Climbing trip to the Camden Hills, 
        and also another Sea Kayaking outing.</p>
      <p align="left">Besides our trips, the BOC also plans other activities and 
        events. Last week, the BOC selected twelve students to participate in 
        our Leadership Training program. Those who were picked completed an in-depth 
        application, and endured a grueling interview. Leadership Training teaches 
        students all they need to know in order to lead a trip into the wilderness. 
        Basic skills about tents, stoves, and camping are integrated with more 
        individualized knowledge of Canoeing, Kayaking, Backpacking, Snowshoeing, 
        etc. Over the semester the LTer's (as they are affectionately called) 
        attend weekly meetings, go on several trips, and are also certified as 
        Wilderness First Responders during an eight-day intensive course. This 
        program occurs every semester, so if you are interested stay tuned to 
        hear when the selection process for the spring will take place.</p>
      <p align="left">Next week also offers plenty of opportunities for education 
        as well. We are not solely about brute strength here at the BOC. Tuesday, 
        the 24th at 7pm, Gina Low from the Association for Promoting Conservation 
        and Education in Amazonia will be speaking about opportunities for students 
        in health and conservation. On Wednesday there is an open pool session 
        for kayaking from 7-9pm. For those interested in Sea Kayaking, there will 
        be an introductory class on Thursday from 3-5:30pm. The OLC is also open 
        at night from 7-11pm on Sunday-Thursday nights, with scheduled and unscheduled 
        events. Stop by to study or hang out, you may just learn how to tie flies 
        with Mike (Mon. 7-9) or do crafts/cooking with Kara (Tues. 7-9).</p>
