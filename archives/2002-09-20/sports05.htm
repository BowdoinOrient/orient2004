        <font size="2">SEAN WALKER</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Having to play Williams, Amherst, and Tufts during the 2002 
        NESCAC season is daunting for any college, as these teams' combined records 
        last season were 21-3. To play the league's best three teams in consecutive 
        weeks is brutal, making even succesful programs apprehensive.</p>
      <p>The Bowdoin Football Team is not one of these aforementioned teams with 
        recent success. Last year, they were able to climb out of the cellar of 
        the NESCAC, finishing with a record of 1-7, improving upon their 0-8 last 
        place finish during the 2000 campaign. </p>
      <p>How do you make a team believe that they can do what the rest of the 
        NESCAC failed to do and defeat even one team from the three headed monster 
        that resides at the top of the league's standings?</p>
      <p>If you are third year Bowdoin Head Coach Dave Caputi, you remain optimistic 
        at all times. </p>
      <p>According to Caputi, &quot;If we work hard and do the right things, both 
        mentally and physically, we have the chance to be successful.&quot;</p>
      <p>Success is not a foreign word to Caputi. Before taking over a Bowdoin 
        program in serious need of rebuilding, he spent twelve years as the offensive 
        coordinator for Williams College, helping lead the Ephs to an 84-9-3 mark 
        during his tenure. </p>
      <p>The team heads into the first three grueling weeks of the season with 
        added confidence after defeating Middlebury Panthers 21-7 in a scrimmage 
        last weekend. The Middlebury game was the &quot;first time we've been 
        able to physically match up with an opponent since I got here&quot; said 
        Caputi. </p>
      <p>The added physical presence of this years team comes after a strenuous 
        lifting and conditioning program followed by players during the spring 
        and summer.</p>
      <p>Of course, all the lifting and conditioning in the world cannot immediately 
        turn around a team in a sport such as football. The Polar Bears are both 
        outnumbered and undersized when compared to most of the teams in the NESCAC, 
        putting them at a disadvantage before the ball is even snapped.</p>
      <p>Caputi's coaching staff and players are fully aware of this. &quot;They 
        expect a lot of themselves. They want to improve. For some guys, the lack 
        of past success is a big motivating factor,&quot; said Caputi.</p>
      <p>The failure of past teams doesn't do much to motivate players who were 
        suiting up for their high school teams during this time last year. On 
        defense alone, Bowdoin will start three first year players. </p>
      <p>These first years will be expected to gel quickly with the Polar Bears 
        returning players. Caputi will look to experienced players on defense 
        such as Jarrett Young '05, Chris Wagner '04, Jeff Pike '04, John Flynn 
        '05 and Brandon Casten '04. </p>
      <p>Only one senior is expected to start on defense, defensive back Jamie 
        Nichols. With his critical interception last weekend against Middlebury, 
        he has proven himself ready to lead a young defense. &quot;We'll need 
        him to play like that everyday,&quot; said Caputi.<br>
        The unit perhaps most indicative as to whether or not the Polar Bears 
        will be successful is the offensive line. Shaun Gagnon '05 and Greg Berry 
        '05 are two sophomores who improved significantly during the offseason.</p>
      <p>Caputi will rely heavily on Captain Justin Foster '03 to head the offensive 
        line. After undergoing a knee operation prior to last season, Foster endured 
        a painful junior year. This year, however, his knee is showing no ill 
        effects.</p>
      <p>While he has set an example for others with his leadership, Foster himself 
        has been impressed with the team's chemistry thus far. &quot;We're a very 
        tight team this year. This is a great group of guys to work with during 
        practice.&quot;</p>
      <p>Foster and his fellow offensive linemen will be expected to protect quarterback 
        and Captain Justin Hardison '03. A veteran who passed for over 1,000 yards 
        last season, Hardison was a force during the Middlebury scrimmage. </p>
      <p>&quot;He made big plays and good decisions in converting four out of 
        four fourth down attempts. He has the ability to make good decisions under 
        pressure,&quot; said Caputi.<br>
        Hardison will team up with fellow captains Sean Starke '03 and Matt Giffune 
        '03 on offense. Starke, who has converted to the running back position 
        after spending last year as a defensive back, will be getting the majority 
        of the carries for the Polar Bears, along with Rob Patchett '05. &quot;We 
        have the advantage of some nice depth there,&quot; said Caputi.</p>
      <p>The Polar Bears are hoping that this depth will enable them to control 
        the pace of games. This will be no easy task in a tough league, however, 
        especially during the first crucial weeks, where a Bowdoin win will surprise 
        even the most optimistic Polar Bear fan. <br>
        After all, although last year Bowdoin was spared from playing the undefeated 
        Williams team as a result of a rotating schedule, Amherst and Tufts defeated 
        them by a combined score of 69-0. </p>
      <p>Expectations still run high in Polar Bear camp after the Middlebury win 
        however, and a win in any three of these games would go a long way to 
        silence the team's critics. <br>
        Said Foster, &quot;We have a huge opportunity to knock off some of the 
        big boys.&quot;</p>
