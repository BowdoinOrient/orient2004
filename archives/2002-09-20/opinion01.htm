        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Last year after the attacks of September 11, our school 
        came together in a solemn, mournful, and supportive way that I will never 
        forget. One of my proudest moments as a Bowdoin student was watching us 
        place all of our temporal concerns aside and help those in our community 
        who had experienced unimaginable personal grief on that day. </p>
      <p align="left">Conversely, I was disappointed in the dearth of ceremony 
        and solemnity on the one-year anniversary. I understand that the day held 
        deeply divergent and personal meaning to many students. Some wanted private 
        solitude and contemplation, while others generally wanted it to be another 
        day. </p>
      <p align="left">Yet an ambivalent student population does not preclude a 
        reflective ceremony. That is what New York City and other municipalities 
        did across the country. Nowhere were people required to stay home from 
        work, but nearly everywhere there were meaningful reminders of the events 
        of a year ago. </p>
      <p align="left">I realized that we needed a formal ceremony on September 
        11, 2002, when I woke up early that morning and was walking across the 
        quad. I remember every minute detail of my day on September 11, 2001, 
        and I remember strolling across the quad on that day as well. Both September 
        11 last year and this year were lovely late-summer mornings. </p>
      <p align="left">I empathized with some New Yorkers who intimated in a recent 
        New York Times issue that the similarity in the weather between this year 
        and last year made remembering September 11 more painful. Despite the 
        temptation, our memories would not allow us to experience a beautiful 
        day in the same way. <br>
        Just as I will never forget September 11, I will never forget the emptiness 
        that I felt a year later on Bowdoin's quad. I thought of how moving it 
        would have been if we had been able to come together as a community the 
        way we did in the days after the attacks last year. </p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately, we turned September 11 into another day in 
        the calendar. There seemed to be little-if any-formal recognition that 
        multiple Bowdoin alumni died on that day along with friends and family 
        members of current Bowdoin students. </p>
      <p align="left">Some people make the argument that those students who did 
        feel a particularly deep sense of personal loss on September 11 had the 
        option to not attend class or engage in a private exercise of remembrance 
        by perhaps attending one of the many local church services commemorating 
        the occasion. </p>
      <p align="left">This logic, however, fails to grasp the severity of the 
        attack. It treats the attacks of September 11 as a professor would treat 
        a student's death in the family: an excuse for class absence, but not 
        a reason to halt the course. <br>
        Though the attacks hit some members of the Bowdoin community harder than 
        others, it hit us all with a level of shock and intensity that requires 
        pause and reflection. We all know where we were when the attacks hit, 
        and our lives will forever be changed by the images of the towers falling. 
        Rarely in history has the entire face and psyche of a nation changed in 
        less than two hours. In that time period, we were forced out of the &quot;Bowdoin 
        Bubble&quot; and were confronted with the fragile reality that is our 
        world. </p>
      <p align="left">Our failure to recognize September 11 this year with the 
        same solemnity, gravity, and respect as most of the country did disregards 
        the connection with the outside world that we forged last year. Our lack 
        of recognition served as an unfortunate validation of the &quot;Bowdoin 
        bubble.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">It would have been appropriate for us to do what President 
        Mills suggested it was not necessary for us to do-to &quot;relive the 
        painful events of that day.&quot; We should have done what the scholar 
        Victor Davis Hanson suggested in the most recent issue of National Review: 
        &quot;stop all public activities and observe an official period of silence, 
        the first of a yearly institutionalized hour of remembrance.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">There would have been nothing inappropriate if the college 
        had decided to cancel classes and activities in the morning of September 
        11. A memorial service on the quad, if there were no other conflicts, 
        would have been a powerful and meaningful way for our campus to reunite, 
        grieve, and reflect as it did after the attacks. </p>
      <p align="left">For many on this campus, September 11, 2002, was a day of 
        indescribable personal pain. For all of us it was a day of difficult but 
        necessary remembrance. Our school should have helped us in our journey 
        to remember and heal in the same ways that it did last year in the immediate 
        aftermath of the attacks. Unfortunately, Bowdoin failed the solemn legacy 
        that is September 11.</p>
