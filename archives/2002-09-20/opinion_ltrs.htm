      <p align="left"><font size="5">Striking Iraq would hurt U.S.</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>As we recall the events of a year ago, we are still grieving as a nation. 
        But now more than ever it is important to think ahead and think clearly. 
        Specifically, we should be thinking about how to effectively prevent acts 
        of terrorism in the future. In doing that, we should be asking whether 
        the Bush Administration's proposed strike against Iraq will help or hinder 
        the United States in its fight against terrorism. I strongly believe that 
        such an attack would do the latter. <br>
        Saddam Hussein is a despicable dictator, but so far the Administration 
        has failed to make any credible connection between his regime and the 
        Al Qaeda terrorist network. If the United States were to attack Iraq, 
        this would divert vast military, intelligence, and financial resources 
        away from routing out terrorist networks. It would also seriously destabilize 
        the Middle East region and would further inflame anti-U.S. sentiment in 
        the Arab world, which would only increase the probability of future terrorist 
        attacks. A U.S. attack on Iraq would also set a terrifying precedent of 
        legitimizing preemptive strikes. It doesn't take much imagination to see 
        that a precedent of attacking a country without clear provocation could 
        set off a Pandora's box of nightmare scenarios in this nuclear age. <br>
        If the U.S. were to attack Iraq, Saddam Hussein would have no reason not 
        to use any weapons of mass destruction he might have, either against our 
        troops or against his neighbors in the region. Iraqi missiles cannot nearly 
        reach the United States, but they could strike Israel. Israel has two 
        hundred nuclear warheads and intermediate range missiles and could very 
        well use them in any retaliatory strike, leading to a conflagration of 
        unimaginable proportions.<br>
        On the issue of Iraq, the Administration has effective diplomatic tools 
        at its disposal. It should use its clout to push for a resumption of weapons 
        inspections instead of starting a war that would divert vast resources 
        away from our fight against terrorism and kill thousands, and perhaps 
        far more, in the process. A team of UN weapons inspectors with unfettered 
        access to sites and backed by an international coalition would address 
        the key issue regarding Iraq: getting rid of weapons of mass destruction. 
        Let's be clear in our task: we need to concentrate our resources on eliminating 
        the threat of terrorist attacks, so that we may never see a day like September 
        11, 2001 again. We should avoid any actions, like attacking Iraq, which 
        would undermine that goal.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>With the reading and discussion of Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed, 
        this year's first-year reading assignment, still fresh in our minds, it 
        seems like an opportune time to tell newcomers to the Bowdoin community 
        about what I consider to be one of the proud moments in Bowdoin history.<br>
        In the 1960s, after the plight of poor Americans had been documented and 
        publicized, President Lyndon Baines Johnson announced an initiative he 
        called the United States' &quot;War on Poverty.&quot; It consisted of 
        a set of federal programs designed to improve the lives and prospects 
        of those &quot;left behind&quot; in our nation's remarkable economic success, 
        and it was big news.<br>
        At Bowdoin it was a hot issue, and a group of students and faculty members 
        formed a loose knit group called Merrymeeting Community Action to help 
        fight the war on poverty in the Brunswick area. Some key figures were 
        Bowdoin professors Paul Hazelton and John Rensenbrink, local druggist 
        Louis Drapeau, and Bowdoin student David Solmitz '65.<br>
        It soon became apparent that a more comprehensive approach was needed, 
        and in 1972, Merrymeeting Community Action was disbanded and the Coastal 
        Economic Development Corporation (CED) was formed and incorporated. CED 
        is a non-profit corporation and is structured according to a national 
        model as a CAP (Community Action Program) Agency. For instance, following 
        the CAP model, representatives of low-income people, elected officials, 
        and the private sector each comprise one-third of CED's board. CED's name 
        reflects the fact that the area it serves is larger than Brunswick and 
        includes, among others, the towns of Bath, Topsham Damariscotta, and Waldoboro. 
        <br>
        What does CED do? It applies for grants from the federal and state governments, 
        and occasionally from private foundations as well, to fund anti-poverty 
        programs, and then it operates those programs. Among the programs currently 
        being operated are the Head Start program for pre-school children at nine 
        different centers; WIC (Women, Infants and Children) nutrition programs; 
        housing assistance programs to assist low income clients with weatherization, 
        improvement of central heating, energy conservation, home repair, and 
        transitional housing; job training and retraining programs, as well as 
        pre-GED tutoring programs; family development programs on a case management 
        basis (if a family has a need in one area, it is likely to have needs 
        in others as well, and this approach attempts to connect families to all 
        the services that are needed); and food assistance programs. CED also 
        owns and operates affordable housing in several locations, and currently 
        has a budget of over $8 million.<br>
        Throughout CED's existence, Bowdoin people have served as volunteer members 
        of its board of directors. Currently John Fitzgerald of the Economics 
        Department serves as its treasurer, and I serve as its president.<br>
        I like to think of the people who work for CED as the foot soldiers in 
        the war on poverty. Their efforts are well conceived and effective, but 
        it is important, and discouraging, to realize that, more than 35 years 
        after it was declared, we have not won that war. All of us at Bowdoin, 
        whether we come from affluent backgrounds or not, live a privileged life 
        while we are here. All around us are people who are not as fortunate as 
        we are. <br>
        Bowdoin students who doubt that they can make an impact on the Brunswick 
        community in the four short years they are here should remember David 
        Solmitz. What he and his friends helped start years ago still endures.

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Speech was not offensive</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Many members of the psychology faculty have written to the Orient claiming 
        that I spoke without respect for their discipline, indeed, without respect 
        for any of the social sciences at the College's convocation ceremony. 
        This surprising accusation is based on a very short section of my speech 
        in which I cautioned that science is not the perfect tool for exploring 
        every problem, and that the suitability of scientific methods should be 
        carefully examined whenever they are employed. My position has never been 
        that the natural sciences are intrinsically superior to others disciplines 
        in this respect, and I do not exempt my own field of Physics from this 
        caution. As an example in my speech, I mentioned the difficulties inherent 
        in studying the behavior of individuals, and it is this example that has 
        drawn fire. To draw from my statements the conclusion that I hold all 
        studies of the behavior of individuals worthless is a very large leap. 
        The greater portion of my speech was devoted to the need for science to 
        be informed by a variety of viewpoints and to the value of a broad education 
        in preparing citizens for meaningful participation in the formation of 
        public science policy. Those interested in the full scope of my speech 
        will find the text at <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/%7Emmsall/speech.doc">http://www.bowdoin.edu/~mmsall/speech.doc</a></p>
