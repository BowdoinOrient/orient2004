        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I've never been a cool kid. From kindergarten to senior 
        year of college, my coolness has been minimal, ranging, some would say, 
        on the lukewarm side of things. Maybe it's even the reason why I chose 
        to go to school in the cold state of Maine.<br>
        By now, I'm comfortable with my lack of coolness, even as I realize that 
        Bowdoin, as Ritalin so correctly assessed, is riddled with cliques. But 
        as I think about my school years of past, I can't help but think that 
        being &quot;cool,&quot; that being a part of the &quot;right&quot; thing, 
        has been an intrinsic factor of my education. This is ironic, perhaps, 
        in an American culture that preaches individualism. Yet &quot;fitting 
        in&quot; is so formative, so influential, that even as a senior in college, 
        the question of being &quot;cool&quot; still rings relevant. <br>
        Perhaps my educational endeavor is beginning to come full circle, and 
        thoughts of years in grade school creep up as I potentially face my last. 
        Sometimes it seems like ages ago when I roamed the halls of grade school, 
        but other times it seems quite recently, perhaps because memories of my 
        very uncool years are so prominent even today. Let's just say fifth grade 
        was not a great year for me.<br>
        I was not hip, I was not with it, let alone jiggy with it. My back-to-school 
        outfit in fifth grade consisted of tight black &quot;riding&quot; pants 
        and a tie-dyed shirt. Not the best of outfits for your first day of school 
        in a town to which you just moved. I didn't know how to peg my pants and 
        I didn't know it was &quot;cool&quot; to tie your shirt in a knot. But 
        fashion aside, I was a shy grade schooler. And let me just say that &quot;shy&quot; 
        is an understatement, considering my internal monologue became an internal 
        dialogue because I was too quiet to talk to anyone but myself. <br>
        Needless to say, daily school activities equaled disaster, and the bus 
        ride to school was anything but the highlight of my day. I would get on 
        the bus every morning and choose a seat near the relative front, an uncool 
        place-even now-to sit. I would &quot;squish in&quot; all the way to the 
        window, and stare at the hand turkeys blazoned on the window that the 
        previous uncool kid had left behind. I would sit and peer at the roadside, 
        anxiously gripping my school bag as if my books and my lunch were the 
        only things I had. It was not before long that I became the target of 
        jeers and taunts of the older, cooler eighth-grade boys.<br>
        I earned my first nickname in fifth grade. Perhaps it was because I did 
        not talk, or because I was alone in a school system that demanded friends, 
        that I piqued their interest. And sure enough, day after day, they would 
        come sit with me on the bus. I refused to talk to them, refused to respond 
        to their teasing, even after they demanded to know my name. I thought 
        my silence would make them all go away, make the bus ride magically shorter, 
        make my fifth-grade year magically cooler. But I never did speak to them, 
        and I never told them my name. So they gave me a name. And like me, it 
        was not very cool. They called me Mooch. God knows why.<br>
        Not many people can come up with a name like that, but Dan did. I can 
        picture his eighth-grade face as clear as day, his preadolescent visage 
        jeering at me like I was his lesser. Maybe I was, but only in age. And 
        so, I was the fifth grader, Mooch, and all the eighth-grade boys loved 
        it. They made my life so uncool. There was no fashion that could amend 
        that one, no freeze tag game I could win at recess to make up for a silly 
        name like that. Mooch was my name, like it or not. <br>
        Of course, I laugh at all of this now. Laugh at the teasing, the uncoolness, 
        because, after all, when you're 21 you can finally be comfortable with 
        who you are. But it's obvious, even at a place like Bowdoin, that belonging 
        to the right group, to the cool kids, is an all too prominent, if not 
        implicit, part of being a Bowdoin student. Some would hope that intellect, 
        or even a greater sense of right and wrong, would break down the necessity 
        to be a certain way. But being with peers breeds cliques, and cliques 
        breed peer pressure. But at this point in my education, I realize that 
        whether you're with the cool kids or not, it's okay to be lukewarm.</p>
