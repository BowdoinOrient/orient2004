      <p align="left">Two Bowdoin students in the Class of '06 have been denied 
        visa approval and one could not reach the U.S. until September 14. A Palestinian 
        and two Chinese first-years were affected because of a policy generated 
        by President George W. Bush, which targets 26 countries for extreme visa 
        evaluation. While the focal point of this policy is Muslim males, they 
        are not exclusive to delays and high rejection rates.</p>
      <p align="left">The two Chinese students-who are female-applied for visas 
        four times and were each time denied. &quot;It's happening across the 
        country, even with professors,&quot; said Wil Smith, Dean of Multicultural 
        Student Programs. Many colleges and universities have faced similar problems 
        getting Chinese students into the country; among those noted are Boston 
        University, St. Lawrence University, and University of Iowa. </p>
      <p align="left">According to the National Association of Foreign Student 
        Advisors (NAFSA), which serves as a campus contact for the I.N.S., the 
        United States government has concerns about the number of Chinese students 
        remaining in the country after college graduation. Margaret Hazlett, Dean 
        of First-Year Students and a member of NAFSA said, &quot;The Immigration 
        and Naturalization Services are watching more closely and making sure 
        that those people they give visas have a strong reason to return back 
        to their country, whether it's family or business.&quot; Most of the 9/11 
        hijackers entered the country with student visas.</p>
      <p align="left">In a recent New York Times article, an American official 
        reported a backlog of at least 100,000 visa applications, now being reviewed 
        by the F.B.I. and C.I.A. One of those was a Bowdoin first-year from East 
        Jerusalem. A Muslim, he applied in early July after the completion of 
        his school year. Typically, the wait is a month, but after returning to 
        the Israeli Ministry of Interior in August, officials informed him the 
        visa was delayed. &quot;The consulate said it may take 'one day, one week, 
        one month, or one year,'&quot; said the frustrated first-year, &quot;A,&quot; 
        who wished to withold his name. &quot;I asked the college to send a letter 
        of acceptance,&quot; he added.</p>
      <p align="left">That Bowdoin is a highly regarded institution has no influence. 
        &quot;People working in the U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the globe 
        may have never heard of Bowdoin College up in Brunswick, Maine,&quot; 
        said Dean Hazlett. The decision depends on the individual student's application; 
        the specific school plays a small role. President Barry Mills and senior 
        senator Olympia Snowe have sent personal letters to the Chinese Consulate. 
        Said Dean Hazlett, &quot;Her [Snowe's] office has helped the college, 
        but it's difficult to get specific information. We were never told from 
        the consulate or Beijing the reasons for their denial. The delayed Palestinian 
        described the Ministry of Interior as &quot;disorganized and procrastinating.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Officials warned A that he should register for the next 
        semester. Bowdoin, however does not traditionally grant spring entry. 
        &quot;If something happened again with the visa, it destroys the future,&quot; 
        he said. Like many countries, Israel's curriculum varies greatly depending 
        on post high school plans. If A had been rejected, he wouldn't have even 
        been able attend a local University.</p>
      <p align="left">On September 10, two weeks into school-well after orientation-A 
        was finally approved. The next day, as if to send a symbolic message, 
        Washington ordered the Israeli Consulate not to issue any visas. 24 hours 
        later, after another letter from Bowdoin, officials informed A he could 
        pick up a visa.</p>
      <p align="left">A has already been to the United States twice in the past 
        three years. Both times to participate at the Seeds of Peace International 
        Camp in Otisfield, ME. Its goal? Spreading peace between conflicting countries.</p>
      <p align="left">The decision now of where to place the two Chinese first-years 
        is up to the admissions office. Three weeks into classes, it's too late 
        to start the semester. &quot;The big question is whether they'll ever 
        be granted visas. It's frustrating-a lose, lose situation. Not only for 
        the students, but for Bowdoin and quite frankly, the United States,&quot; 
        said Dean Hazlett. </p>
