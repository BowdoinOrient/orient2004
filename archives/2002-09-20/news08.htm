      <div align="center"><b>Groups sue over MCAS high school exit exam</b> </div>
      <p> Six students who failed Massachusetts' MCAS high school exit exam are 
        suing the state of Massachusetts, claiming that the test discriminates 
        against minorities and the economically disadvantaged. In addition, the 
        lawsuit claims that the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System 
        is unreliable and unfair.</p>
      <p>The six students are all in the Class of 2003, with four of the plaintiffs 
        being students at Holyoke Public Schools. The Class of 2003 is the first 
        class that was required to pass the exam's English and math portions in 
        order to graduate.</p>
      <p>Half of all Hispanic and 44 percent of black Massachusetts high school 
        seniors did not pass the test after three tries. The average failure rate 
        for the entire state is 19 percent. </p>
      <p>The lawsuit seeks class-action status and was filed by representatives 
        of the Center for Law and Education and the Boston Bar Association's committee 
        for civil rights amongst others. Defendants include the state Board of 
        Education, the state Department of Education, and Holyoke city schools. 
      </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Authorities arrest 115 &quot;date rape&quot; drug traffickers</b></p>
      <p> Federal authorities recently arrested 115 people in the United States 
        in Canada in connection with an Internet drug-trafficking ring. Using 
        the World Wide Web as a worldwide drug market, the criminals acted as 
        leaders and mid-level traffickers of three related chemical depressants: 
        GHB, GB, and 1,4 butanediol (often called BD). </p>
      <p>The arrests covered 84 cities in both countries and came after a glut 
        of major seizures on the U.S.-Canada border by the U.S. Customs Service. 
        The drugs were sold on Canadian web pages and shipped to purchasers, who 
        sometimes acted as distributors themselves. </p>
      <p>Over two years, authorities seized 3,300 gallons of GBL and more than 
        $1 million from seven companies. Although the chemicals have legitimate 
        uses in the industrial sector, GHB and the other chemicals are more widely 
        referred to as &quot;date rape&quot; drugs. The depressants are sometimes 
        used recreationally, but often used to spike drinks in advance of a sexual 
        assault. GHB and its related drugs have been connected to the rapes and 
        deaths of women across the nation.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Maine prepares for slower leaf-peeper season</b></p>
      <p> Maine and the New England Region as a whole are expecting fewer leaf 
        tourists this year as a result of the lingering effects of the September 
        11 terrorist attacks. With fears of terrorism and a slow economy, a larger 
        proportion of foreign tourists cancelled their trips this year and more 
        Americans from outside New England decided to remain closer to home.<br>
        Typically, European travelers compose 10 to 20 percent of foliage tourists, 
        but with this year's cancellations, many hotels that are often booked 
        well ahead of time still have vacancies.</p>
      <p>Complicating this year's slow leaf-peeping season, drought and hot summer 
        temperatures will leave larger-than-average areas of spotty color changes. 
        Additionally, September's heat and temperature swings are expected to 
        create a later color change than usual. With Columbus Day weekend falling 
        later-than-usual this year, the color change will still correspond with 
        the peak leaf-peeper weekend, a staple of the multibillion-dollar regional 
        tourist industry.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Sea Dogs sign deal with Red Sox</b></p>
      <p> The Portland Sea Dogs recently announced that it had signed a two-year 
        deal with the Boston Red Sox. Portland's minor league baseball team will 
        retain its name, management, ownership, and mascot; the team's colors, 
        however, will change from teal to Boston's distinctive red and blue. The 
        Red Sox will supply players and field staff.</p>
      <p>The Sea Dogs have been the AA affiliate of the Florida Marlins for the 
        past nine years, with 81 players moving from the Sea Dogs to at least 
        one major league at-bat for the Marlins.</p>
      <p>The Red Sox previously retained a AA affiliate in Trenton, New Jersey 
        and are expected to bring some of the Trenton coaching staff up to Portland. 
        Attending the ceremony at the Sea Dog's Hadlock Field were owner Dan Burke, 
        general manager Charlie Eshbach, and members of the Red Sox management 
        staff. </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Former Texas A&amp;M student executed for murder of 
        fellow student</b></p>
      <p> The state of Texas executed former a Texas A&amp;M student by lethal 
        injection Wednesday for killing a female student during a home burglary 
        eight years earlier. Ron Shamburger, 30, was convicted of killing fellow 
        student Lori Baker on September 30, 1994. </p>
      <p>A fifth-year student, Shamburger broke into Baker's house, bound her 
        with duct tape, and shot her in the head. Confronted by Baker's roommate, 
        Shamburger abducted the roommate and stuffed her in the trunk of a car. 
        While Shamburger set fire to Baker's house, the roommate escaped and called 
        for help. Hours later, Shamburger turned himself into police.<br>
        Baker's murder was the last in a string of local burglaries by Shamburger. 
        The murder weapon, a 9mm pistol, was purchased with a credit card stolen 
        from Baker's home two days earlier.</p>
