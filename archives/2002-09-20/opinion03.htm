      <p align="left"><font size="5">Calling the U.N.'s bluff on Iraqi policy<br>
        <font size="2">PATRICK ROCKEFELLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> For months, like poker players trying to win a hand while 
        holding nothing, the chattering classes of professional Bush critics had 
        been calling for the President to go to the UN to get approval for a strike 
        on Iraq, thinking either that he never would or that he'd fail to be convincing 
        if he did. Bush called their bluff, and was holding aces. </p>
      <p align="left">The success came partly in the simple outline of grievances 
        against Saddam Hussein, coupled with the list of UN resolutions dating 
        back to the Gulf War cease-fire that called for corrective measures on 
        pain of military action. <br>
        The clincher was in correctly framing the whole issue as a case of Iraqi 
        defiance of the UN, not of U.S. unilateralism. The President invoked the 
        specter of the League of Nations, that ill-fated inter-war good intention 
        which fell to irrelevance due to its inability to act. </p>
      <p align="left">By making such a clear case, the President put the onus 
        on the United Nations and our faint-hearted allies to make a choice. That 
        choice is between supporting a U.S.-led attack with strong UN backing, 
        or a unilateralist U.S. attack coupled with the permanent irrelevance 
        of the UN because it was too timid to enforce its own resolutions. </p>
      <p align="left">Admittedly, this is an important long-term decision for 
        the UN, as it will dictate its influence for the foreseeable future. Will 
        it be an institution that recognizes injustice, that requires changes 
        to be made in regimes like Iraq, and then does nothing? Or will it be 
        a true force for good, and act with military might when it is necessary?</p>
      <p align="left">Those that criticize U.S. hegemony should be praying the 
        UN makes the right choice, because a strong, internationally active and 
        respected UN could be a significant counterweight to the status of the 
        U.S. as the world's only superpower. Should people recognize this it would 
        be, of course, ironic that it took our cowboy President to make them see 
        it. </p>
      <p align="left">I have leapt to the conclusion that a military strike will 
        be necessary, although there is new talk of UN weapons inspectors, which 
        could conceivably preclude the need to bomb and occupy the country. There 
        are many drawbacks to weapons inspections, and one could make a very solid 
        case for removing Hussein and then sending in inspectors rather than the 
        other way around. But sending inspectors in first may need to be part 
        of the game we play with Iraq, and if the UN is willing to back its words 
        with deeds, it can also solidify the case against Hussein. </p>
      <p align="left">Since Bush's speech, Iraq has promised &quot;unfettered 
        access&quot; for weapons inspectors. This will surely turn into another 
        circus of obfuscation and obstruction intended to frustrate and confuse 
        inspectors and those who are eager to find a reason not to attack. Hussein 
        has spent much of the last decade making his weapon labs mobile and has 
        become quite adept at hiding his deadly toys. </p>
      <p align="left">We must be prepared to be patient when we need to be, and 
        impatient when Hussein delays and denies access. Keep in mind, rather 
        than voluntarily prove that he has disarmed his country, which would result 
        in an end to the decade of sanctions that have cost him between $150 and 
        $200 billion in oil revenue, he has continued to refuse inspections. This 
        means Hussein has something he wishes to keep hidden and values at no 
        less than $150 to $200 billion.</p>
      <p align="left">When Hussein inevitably decides to prevent entry to a building, 
        to delay inspectors for hours (he delayed them for days in the past), 
        to threaten them, to limit their searches-that is the moment the UN will 
        have to make the big choice. And they should make it quickly because U.S. 
        cruise missiles and F-11's will be on the way. </p>
      <p align="left">If the U.S. acts without the UN, it will prove that the 
        only leadership in the world worth consideration is the U.S. leadership. 
        The catch-22, however, is that if the UN now acts after the U.S. prodded 
        it to, it may appear that the UN is merely the U.S.'s puppet. This is 
        correct to a degree. President Bush essentially (sticking to the often 
        used cowboy theme) grabbed the bull by the ring in its nose and dragged 
        it where he wanted it to go. But he may well have saved the UN in doing 
        so. </p>
      <p align="left">The UN holds no significant influence over U.S. policy, 
        but the U.S. certainly holds some over the UN. This is largely the fault 
        of past UN inaction in the Balkans and elsewhere, and can only be corrected 
        in the long term by providing some military leadership and initiative 
        of its own. <br>
        Ultimately, Iraq is the UN's responsibility, and has been since the Gulf 
        War. If it wishes to avoid the fate of the League of Nations, it will 
        have to stand strong in support of it's own resolutions. But even if it 
        doesn't, the U.S. will. </p>
