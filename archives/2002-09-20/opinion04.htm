      <p align="left"><font size="5">Living the best years of our lives<br>
        <font size="2">LARA JACOBS</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Anytime I expressed dissatisfaction with aspects of high 
        school, adults always responded, &quot;Just wait till college.&quot; Then 
        you will be living the &quot;best years of your life.&quot; By the time 
        I arrived at the polar bear statue guarding Smith Union, my expectations 
        of Bowdoin and of myself were overpowering. Meeting best friends for life 
        in the first two days, attending mind-expanding lectures on the Middle 
        East, trying crew (not usually an option in landlocked Colorado), and 
        writing for the Orient all fought for precedence in my thoughts, along 
        with the more personal expectations to be more outgoing, to try something 
        scary each day, to &quot;fit in&quot; to the microcosm known as the East 
        Coast. </p>
      <p align="left">After a week of speeches inspiring first-years to &quot;take 
        advantage&quot; of everything Bowdoin offers and not live a life of &quot;what 
        ifs,&quot; during which my advisor, Mary Hunter, asked what I feared most 
        about college, all of the expectations, speeches and activity fairs boiled 
        over into a tangible fear of missing something. I explained to her that 
        my goal for college was to &quot;do everything.&quot; Luckily for me, 
        Professor Hunter had much more sense than I, and simply said, &quot;You 
        won't. You can't possibly do everything&quot;-at the end of your four 
        years there will always be that philosophy class you wish you hadn't missed, 
        or that sky-diving club you wish you had tried.</p>
      <p align="left">Later, while reading the 75 emails from all forty-five clubs 
        I signed up for at the activities fair, I appreciated for the first time 
        how limited these four years are, and realized that college is a reckoning 
        of sorts-a coming to terms with who you are versus who you expected yourself 
        to be. Through many trials and many more errors, I've realized that &quot;being 
        more outgoing&quot; means meeting five new people today, not joining the 
        debate team; that crossing the country to go to a college where I didn't 
        know anyone means that I'm lucky if I do one familiar thing each day in 
        the midst of twenty-five that are new and scary; that it does take time 
        to adjust to a place where it seems the majority of the student body is 
        &quot;from right outside of Boston&quot; and Wal-Mart is the exciting 
        activity of choice for a Saturday afternoon (a little much for a girl 
        from Boulder, Colorado). </p>
      <p align="left">Thus, I attend activity meetings, until I have such a plethora 
        of handouts they could last as fuel for a month, to find what I really 
        want to be a part of. I get up my courage and question upperclassmen at 
        the library to find out which classes will make me question the way I 
        look at the world. I meet at least 100 people to find seven close friends. 
        The world may be my oyster, but it's still my job to crack open the shell 
        to find the pearl. </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to helping me redefine my goals, Professor Hunter 
        left me with one more piece of advice: &quot;embrace the monkey wrench.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Throughout your time in college, embrace the class outside 
        your major that makes you seriously question and rethink what you want 
        to do with your life. Embrace the friend that comes from a different political 
        or religious background than you do and thus questions or disproves your 
        assumptions. Embrace the moment of recognition when it dawns on you that 
        even though you've taken French for the past six years of your life, you're 
        ready to try something new. Embrace that which will potentially alter 
        your carefully planned path to who you thought you were and where you 
        thought you were going. </p>
      <p align="left">For me, this has meant taking classes on symphonies and 
        on Dante's Divine Comedy, discovering I love the ocean as much as the 
        mountains, replacing the fiction next to my bed with biographies of Dante 
        and studies of Florence-and my CD player now holds Beethoven's 9th instead 
        of U2. Nevertheless, embracing monkey wrenches not only encompasses welcoming 
        the new parts of myself, but also accepting what's already here-I'm not 
        a soccer player or rower; I'd rather change the status quo through an 
        editorial than an election. </p>
      <p align="left">The point is that I am no longer waiting for college, I'm 
        here. And Bowdoin, just like most things in life, is what I make of it. 
        This process of self-discovery, of replacing expectations of situations 
        and of myself with the reality of who I am and what I enjoy doing just 
        might make these next four years the best of my life.</p>
