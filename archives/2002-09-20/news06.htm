        <font size="2">HANNAH DEAN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">With problems such as violence, a drug-based economy, and 
        unwanted international intervention, the country of Colombia has faced 
        major obstacles on its road to political and social stability. Russell 
        Crandall '94, a MacArthur Assistant Professor of Political Science at 
        Davidson College, addressed these issues in his Tuesday evening lecture 
        entitled &quot;Drugs, Terror and Civil War in Colombia: New Directions 
        for US Policy.&quot; Crandall, who recently published Driven by Drugs: 
        U.S. Policy Toward Colombia, made clear in his lecture that he had a personal, 
        as well as academic interest, in the political and social issues in Colombia. 
        Working as a human rights activist in Colombia, Crandall saw first hand 
        the toll that the drugs and violence took on both the Colombian community 
        and landscape. </p>
      <p align="left">In his lecture, Crandall began by explaining that Colombia 
        has been fraught with violence since the 1960s when leftist guerrilla 
        insurgents began fighting in the countryside and provincial cities. Rather 
        than weakening over the decades, these groups &quot;are stronger today 
        than ever,&quot; said Crandall. Furthermore, he said, &quot;right-wing 
        paramilitary groups have launched an undeclared war on suspected civilian 
        supporters of the guerrillas, destabilizing an already chaotic situation 
        in Colombia.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">On top of the political clash between left-wing liberals 
        and right-wing conservatives, he discussed the unchecked drug problem. 
        Cocaine, the main export drug, began as a crop in Bolivia and Peru. The 
        raw or partly processed cocaine would then be shipped into Colombia where 
        it would be refined in labs and then exported to other countries, including 
        the United States. </p>
      <p align="left">The United States took action against the drug trafficking 
        in the 1980s by targeting the actual crops as well as the Colombian kingpins, 
        but this pushed production into more unstable and rural southern Colombia. 
        Crandall explained that farmers who had been growing coffee were now growing 
        cocaine and, to make matters worse, the crops were now located in areas 
        controlled by the guerillas. Labs that had once been easy to target now 
        became localized and the drug operations, once concentrated, became &quot;ma 
        and pa&quot; type operations.</p>
      <p align="left">Paramilitaries in Colombia then began a &quot;reign of terror&quot; 
        against civilians so as to get at the guerrillas indirectly. Essentially, 
        by means of the drug wars, the U.S. had destabilized an already faltering 
        Colombia. In 1998, when conservative party candidate Andres Pastrana was 
        inaugurated, the playing field changed. Crandall explained that Pastrana 
        wanted peace, but the United States, well practiced in the art of war, 
        &quot;did not have a peace policy.&quot; The result of much deliberation 
        was &quot;Plan Colombia&quot;-a project to reinforce the Colombian government's 
        fight in the age-old civil war, financed in part by the U.S. </p>
      <p align="left">Since Pastrana took office, conditions have improved significantly, 
        &quot;but this does not mean that narcotization has ended&quot; said Crandall. 
        &quot;As long as the United States continues to make the drug war the 
        overriding focus of its policies toward Colombia&quot; as it has in the 
        past, Colombia's political and social future will remain on unstable ground. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor Crandall has served as a consultant for the World 
        Bank, the United Nations Project on Restored Democracies, and has worked 
        as a project analyst for Catholic Relief Services in Quito, Ecuador and 
        Bogot&aacute;, Colombia. Presently, Crandall is serving as a consultant 
        for the Department of Defense on Colombian Politics.</p>
