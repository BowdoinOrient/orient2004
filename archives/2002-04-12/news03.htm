        Kent Chabotar has finally decided to become a president himself.<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">Chabotar has been appointed as the eighth president of Guilford 
        College, a liberal arts college located in Greensboro, North Carolina.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to his presidential responsibilities, Chabotar 
        will also join the Guilford faculty as a professor of political science.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Guilford College was founded in 1837 by the Quakers and 
        is the third-oldest co-educational higher education institute in the country. 
        The college remains affiliated with the Quaker religion and has a student 
        body of approximately 1500.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar announced in October of last year that he would 
        be leaving Bowdoin in June of this year, ending eleven years as treasurer 
        of the College.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When asked whether or not he thought last October that he 
        might be a college president less than a year later, Chabotar said, &quot;It 
        was one of the things that I thought might happen, but that wasn't what 
        I was hanging my entire career goal on.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After teaching college presidents for twelve years, Chabotar 
        said, &quot;It's been dawning on me, 'I could do this. I could do this 
        job. You guys aren't that special.'&#133;And obviously working with Edwards 
        for ten or eleven years,&#133;that gave me some hope that I could pull 
        it off, too.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar said that he had also considered a wide variety 
        of other options: taking a position as a provost at a university, a CEO 
        of a student loan corporation, or the treasurer of Amherst or Dartmouth; 
        working in investment funds; or joining the faculty at Harvard or some 
        other institution.<br>
        Another option, he said, would have been for him to do nothing. &quot;Frankly, 
        if something really good hadn't come along, I would have done that,&quot; 
        he said.<br>
        When asked why he decided to remain in higher education, Chabotar said, 
        &quot;I think it's because it's what I was going to do. I think that there 
        are fates in the lives of men and women. I really do believe that.&#133;I 
        do think I was fated to stay in higher ed. a) because I really like it 
        b) because I've built up a lot of experience that I didn't want to go 
        to waste and c) because the opportunity came along to stay in higher ed. 
        I think if any one of those three had not been there, I wouldn't have.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar also said that his real love in higher education 
        is teaching, but he enjoys the administrative parts as well. &quot;I find 
        just teaching without administration to not be as cool,&quot; he said. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar said that he hopes he will be able to do a competent 
        job serving as both a president and a professor. &quot;I'm single&#133;so 
        I can put into class and students a lot of the emotional and physical 
        energy that many people put into their families&#133;I would be very disappointed 
        if I can't pull it off.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When asked about the differences between Bowdoin and Guilford, 
        Chabotar said that they are both very similar but that Guilford has one 
        sixth of the resources that Bowdoin has. He also said that Guilford is 
        behind Bowdoin in terms of a residential life plan, but like Bowdoin, 
        there are no fraternities. The Guilford campus is also three times larger 
        than Bowdoin's.<br>
        Chabotar described the Guilford campus by saying, &quot;It's like putting 
        Colby down in North Carolina&#133;Very Georgian. Big columns.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Guilford's financial situation is very similar that of Bowdoin's 
        when Chabotar first arrived at the College in the early 1990s. Bowdoin 
        claimed to have a balanced budget, just as Guilford does now. But neither 
        budgets were really balanced.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;If you deter maintenance, you jack up the tuition 
        prices very high, and you overspend from endowment, two of the three of 
        which Guilford does, and all three of which Bowdoin did, the budget isn't 
        balanced,&quot; Chabotar said.<br>
        According to Chabotar, Guilford has a resource problem. Their budget is 
        half that of Bowdoin's, and their endowment is one seventh that of Bowdoin's. 
        Guilford just completed a $50 million capital campaign, whereas Bowdoin's 
        most recent capital campaign raised $136 million. Because the size of 
        Guilford's student body is similar to that of Bowdoin's, Guilford's resources 
        are far more stretched. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;You can imagine that&#133;the same opulence that we 
        have, they can only aspire to,&quot; Chabotar said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Chabotar's new position will present him with a number 
        of financial challenges, he is not leaving because Bowdoin no longer has 
        its own financial challenges.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;All colleges are like open boats on the ocean&#133;and 
        these are treacherous seas. Bowdoin is as aware of the limitations and 
        the need for financial aid money, the need to keep affordable, the need 
        to attract students from across the country, the need to invest in IT, 
        student life, etc. The task is never done. I think that's clear up here, 
        even ten years later. Guilford is the same. There's a palpable sense of 
        unfinished business.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One major difference between Bowdoin and Guilford is that 
        Guilford is a Quaker college. Chabotar, who is Catholic, said he feels 
        that his values will fit in well with the Quaker religion. &quot;Students 
        will tell you that I'm very truthful, very candid. I just tell you what 
        I think. That's what Quakers believe, too. It's what they call truth-telling. 
        I believe in consensual decision-making if possible&#133;[The budget] 
        has been unanimous here every year for eleven years, and the president 
        has never changed a dime of the recommendation. I believe in that stuff&#133;I 
        also believe in tolerance a lot. Look at Maine. Mainers are known for 
        live and let live. Quakers are the same.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Regarding the position of president, Chabotar said, &quot;It's 
        not as powerful as people think. I think your responsibilities are a hell 
        of a lot more significant than your authority. I think that you're more 
        of a moral leader and exemplar than you are a top-down field marshal.&quot;</p>
