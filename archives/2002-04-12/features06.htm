        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> This year I spent my winter break in Beijing, catching 
        up on some of my research projects there. Even though I have been to Beijing 
        many times, I am still amazed by the contrast in our economies as I move 
        from here to there and back to here. In the month that I was gone from 
        Brunswick, one old family-owned restaurant went out of business (Vincenzo's 
        Italian Restaurant) Otherwise, the town was unchanged. And that is not 
        unusual for Brunswick. There have been times when I have been gone for 
        a year and would still only observe two or three changes down Maine Street 
        and across the campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Beijing is a different story. I left in July and returned 
        in December. In that time, three entire neighborhoods, all within walking 
        distance of our apartment, were destroyed. In their place are the biggest 
        holes in the ground I have ever seen, and new temporary buildings around 
        the fringes to house the construction workers. My kids were sad because 
        there is a worker dormitory where the trampolines used to be in the park 
        across the street. The construction workers assure us that the trampoline 
        and playground will return when the building is finished later this year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the site of largest of the three holes, we were told 
        that 30,000 construction workers are living and working there. That's 
        more people than live in Brunswick! Most of them probably just arrived 
        in Beijing from the countryside and when the project is finished they 
        will go home. Actually, most of them went home for Spring Festival (Chinese 
        New Years) but then returned to work in Beijing four weeks later. Almost 
        all building projects are staffed by migrant labor.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During the same time that I was away (July to December) 
        the hole in front of the kids' school has sprouted six 20 story apartment 
        buildings that are almost ready for occupancy; even more amazingly, the 
        fourth ring road near the kids' school had gone from a newly demolished 
        strip of sandy dirt to a six lane highway (four for cars, two for bicycles) 
        complete with an amazing below grade underpass and four more lanes of 
        access roads. How long have we been working on widening the Maine Turnpike? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the space of six months in Beijing, you can see a building 
        built, occupied, destroyed, and rebuilt. Is this an example of disorganized 
        zoning boards? Perhaps, but the economist in me says that is just as likely 
        to be the result of an efficient decision making process. Given the cost 
        of building, it may pay to build a building in a certain location even 
        if you know that location is scheduled for demolition soon. It is all 
        about the relative cost of labor. We in the U.S. are use to our relatively 
        high costs of labor and our slow but steady 1 to 3 percent annual growth 
        rates. In China today, labor is cheap and plentiful (from the economic 
        view, cheap and plentiful are really the same thing). Their economy is 
        growing at 7 to 9 percent a year. To me, it is an economist's paradise, 
        where I look out the window and literally watch the economic landscape 
        change overnight.</p>
