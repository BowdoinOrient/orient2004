      <p> Maybe it's unfair, but there's an unspoken understanding between filmmakers 
        and moviegoers that if you direct one great movie, they'd all better be 
        great afterwards. After all, talent is hard to come by in Hollywood, and 
        if you have it, you'd better use it and it had better work. If it doesn't, 
        you become Kevin Costner, and after the trillionth bad movie you make, 
        people will finally forget <i>Dances With Wolves</i> and will start to 
        hate you.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I can only hope that this never becomes the case with director David 
        Fincher, who gave us the masterpieces <i>Fight Club</i> and <i>Seven</i> 
        a couple years back. He's come to a bump. There's a ray of hope, though: 
        unlike Costner, Fincher didn't actually try to make <i>Panic Room </i>an 
        A+; he meant to slide by with a C.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Not only was Fincher given a premise full of thrilling possibilities 
        in <i>Panic Room</i>, he even got Jodie Foster-Jodie Foster! The female 
        Edward Norton, I thought. Surely he'll squeeze out all the talent that 
        girl's got-he'll make this film all it can be.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Well, he didn't, but at least he admitted it: &quot;A number of the film's 
        problems were created by my inability to allow the film to grow in the 
        ways it wanted to,&quot; he said in an interview. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Though <i>Panic Room</i> was unable to reach its potential, what it does 
        provide is edge-of-your-seat entertainment, joining the many fleeting 
        but fun &quot;popcorn movies&quot; that give you two hours of thrills 
        but nothing to remember them by.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Panic Room is the story of Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and Sarah Altman's 
        (Kristen Stewart) first night in their new home. Not knowing that anyone 
        lived in the house, three burglars (Jared Leto, Forest Whitaker, and Dwight 
        Yoakam) break in with the intention of stealing the fortune that is hiding 
        in the house's maximum-security panic room. But Meg and Sarah get there 
        first and refuse to come out, sparking the night's suspenseful events.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I found the structure of the film to be sort of like an essay: the first 
        20 minutes made up the exciting introduction, setting up a promising story 
        that has a million places to go. The rest of the film provides a series 
        of supporting arguments all making the same point; Meg and Sarah spend 
        a lot of time sitting in the room, while the burglars spend a lot of time 
        being stupid, providing some of the film's funnier moments. All in all, 
        the movie doesn't really go anywhere; it stays right where it was at the 
        end of the intro. The characters are hung out to dry, the plot rots, and 
        the ending-well, the ending absolutely sucks. Blame this on the writer, 
        David Koepp, who also gave us <i>Stir of Echoes</i>. You'd think Fincher 
        would make the necessary adjustments and save his movie from its all too 
        apparent script shortcomings-but no. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, I'm being picky. But, see, that's kind of my job. So for all 
        you not-so-hard-to-please moviegoers out there I want to reiterate the 
        fact that despite its apparent defects, this film is thrilling and fun 
        to watch. And even though Meg's character doesn't really develop, Jodi 
        sure knows how to light up a room full of propane gas, run up and down 
        stairs, and kick some burglar arse. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If David Fincher didn't direct this film-if it were some no-name who 
        hadn't made one of my favorite movies ever-then maybe I wouldn't be so 
        disillusioned. But talent that goes to waste is just disgusting, especially 
        in these tough cinematic times when good movies are becoming a dying breed. 
        <br>
        If you got it, flaunt it, oh Hollywood filmmakers. Leave the &quot;popcorn 
        movies&quot; to the amateurs and give us the good stuff. </p>
