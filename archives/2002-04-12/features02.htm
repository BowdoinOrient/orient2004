      <p align="left"> The Las Vegas airport: the perfect place to begin a trip 
        that is centered around getting in touch with nature. Constant images 
        of white tigers, blue men, and exotic women and men got the twelve intrepid 
        members of the Bowdoin Outing Club's first Grand Canyon trip ready to 
        experience the untamed wilds of Arizona. <br>

      <p align="left">After collecting the baggage and Bill, the group ventured 
        down the strip, across the Hoover Dam and over to the Grand Canyon itself. 
        Just like good campers, the BOC settled down in an illegal parking lot 
        covered in snow for a well deserved good night's rest.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Before the sun rose, the Las Vegas Twelve were awoken by 
        the rapid attacks of wild coyotes. Mike &quot;The Head&quot; Ritter successfully 
        beat off the wild beasts, and the group packed up for their descent into 
        the canyon. It was a tearful goodbye when the group split up into their 
        respective groups of six to continue the rest of the journey. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From now on we will refer to the two groups as Team &quot;Thunder 
        From Down Under&quot; (lead by Meg &quot;The Tyrant&quot; Tierny and Mike 
        &quot;The Head&quot; Ritter) and Team &quot;Dominade&#153;&quot; ( lead 
        by Cecily &quot;Touchy Feely&quot; Upton and George &quot;The Narrator&quot; 
        Hubbard). Team Dominade consisted of Luigi Taylor, Chewy Connolly, Jeff 
        &quot;The Chef&quot; Cook, and Erin &quot;Smells Like Cabbage&quot; Carney.<br>

      <p align="left">Since the narrator was not present on Team Thunder From 
        Down Under's venture, their details will be carelessly left out unless 
        they directly pertain to Team Dominade&#153;'s progress. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After the first day, which brought Team D. 5,000 feet under 
        the canyon rim, they set up camp on a beautiful sand dune on the bank 
        of the mighty Colorado River. Much to the chagrin of T.D., it turned out 
        that Team Thunder had stolen a set of tent poles and a frying pan from 
        our protagonist travelers. So, T.D. set up the one working tent (which 
        promptly blew into the Colorado) and a rain tarp (which immediately became 
        shelter for deadly scorpions and rabid mice). Despite these set backs, 
        the group pressed on.<br>
        With only three miles to cover on the second day, T.D. got a leisurely 
        start at eleven o'clock. Little did T.D. realize that these three miles 
        were going to be the most treacherous of their trip. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The group soon discovered that the official Grand Canyon 
        map was the biggest psych that anyone had ever been a part of. The supposedly 
        flat trail actually scaled cliffs which summed up to hundreds of vertical 
        feet. Using superb team work and the harness rigging skills of one Jeff 
        &quot;The Chef&quot; Cook, the team was able to ascend the rock walls 
        and rope packs. <br>
        After teetering on the brink of hundred foot cliffs?and insanity for that 
        matter?leaders Cecily and George claimed &quot;Boy, did we pick the wrong 
        time to quit sniffing glue.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After a grueling day, the group laid down to sleep-only 
        to be attacked by flesh eating ravens and persistent Canucks.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now knowing what the treacherous canyon had to offer, our 
        daring travelers got up at the crack of dawn and began forging a trail 
        along the canyon walls. To lighten the somber mood, due to the elk carrion 
        which was passed early in the morning, Chewy Connolly impressed the group 
        with her amazing skill of fitting as many granola bars into her stomach 
        at one time as humanly possible. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Right as the tirade of stupid human tricks ended, Team Thunder 
        From Down Under came 'round the bend. The Thunder were in bad shape. It 
        seems as though the extra weight of the previously mentioned stolen items 
        had taken its toll on the unprepared thieves. Serves them right. Feeling 
        sorry for their lesser peers, T.D. did their part to lighten the load 
        of Team Thunder and sent them packing. The rest of the day was perfectly 
        lovely.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Day four was ridiculous. Only one mile to go, and if the 
        team made it that far, they had a day of rest waiting for them tomorrow. 
        Whoever put the permits together was a &quot;real joker.&quot; T.D. decided 
        to sprint the first half mile (being jacked from their previous days) 
        and take a break in the shade of a precarious cliff. The laziness of the 
        day swept over our sojourners like the swift Colorado River below. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second half of the mile was sprinted backwards. The 
        team set up camp in the thicket of a briar patch to keep out of the raging 
        sand storm (they're the BOC, and the BOC does that sort of thing). Luigi 
        Taylor declared this day &quot;The biggest psych of your life.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The next day was also filled with unbelievable amounts of 
        laze. Waking up late lead to a slow breakfast of pancakes over a Whisperlite&reg; 
        stove. When they say Whisperlite they mean it. I could have breathed on 
        the pancakes and they would have cooked faster. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anyway, using Erin's nimble fingers, some chewing gum, two 
        rolls of duct tape, and some special &quot;Green Tea&quot;, the team was 
        able to create a more powerful stove. To celebrate, calzones were made 
        for dinner.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final day: T.D. woke up early and turned their gazes 
        to the looming 5,000 foot canyon wall. A feeling of electricity was in 
        the air, one could almost see sparks fly between the voyagers. After all 
        of the static electricity had been shaken out of the fleeces, the travelers 
        were on their way. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cecily cracked the whip and brought the group up to a five 
        minute mile pace. At the lunch break, the team stopped to take many promotional 
        photos of themselves for their sponsor, Domino Sugar&#153;. Feeling rather 
        frisky, the team upped their pace to four minutes per mile and summited 
        the rim by 2 in the afternoon. A brand new Montero was waiting for T.D. 
        at the trailhead. If you have the means I highly recommend picking one 
        up. It's so choice. At the successful reunion of the split group, stories 
        were traded, music was made, and all lived happily ever after.<br>
