        <font size="2">MIKE CHAN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Infectious Organism. Definition: An individual form of life, 
        such as a plant or animal, that can easily or readily communicate. This 
        definition is not enough to describe the conscious poeticism played over 
        live instrumentation of the underground hip-hop group, Infectious Organisms. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Richmond, Virginia based underground hip-hop group consists of Dave 
        Sunderland on Bass, Mike Mathews on Piano, Brooke Blair on Guitar and 
        Will Blair on Drums. Altogether they seamlessly fuse jazz and funk with 
        hip-hop to create musical beats that any street poet would be happy to 
        rap to. And in fact, two gifted MCs, Felton Martin and Jean Babtiste, 
        do in fact harmoniously bless the incredibly soothing backbeats. Although 
        Organisms has spawned a new breed of bohemian-chilled rap music, only 
        a few listeners of hip-hop have been lucky enough to hear their indulgent 
        medium.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is true of underground music in general. For an underground hip-hop 
        group such as Infectious Organisms, their exposure is rarely noticed under 
        the success of commercial rappers these days. You usually see underground 
        groups like them opening for acts not any larger than themselves. Even 
        though it does not seem like a lot to the average pop music listener, 
        about 5000 copies of their 1999 independently released self-titled debut 
        album have been sold. Recognition of the group has increased with every 
        opening Organisms performs for groups such as Medeski, Martin and Wood, 
        The Roots, Blackstar, and Outkast, to name a few. The group's ability 
        to stay un-jaded by their modest performances and profits has been enough 
        for them to follow up their debut album with a second album, released 
        three weeks ago. Their second album, entitled <i>Human Experience</i>, 
        maintains Infectious Organisms's trademark jazz-funk-hip-hop sound. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The group works under the theme of women and men and their daily interactions 
        and is therefore mostly a compilation of songs revolving around love and 
        compassion. Whether they are describing the love for hip-hop or describing 
        the overcoming lives of misguided women in their lives, MCs Babtiste and 
        Martin paint vivid details of each. At one point Babtiste flows, &quot;daddy's 
        little girl running through the streets/ followed by a dark cloud / everybody's 
        got a price / and she's marked down,&quot; explaining how the transformation 
        of a young child to a woman has led her to lower standards. This type 
        of poetic imagery linked with underlying messages, is littered like New 
        Year's confetti on this album.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The track &quot;City Limits&quot; is another example of Infectious Organisms's 
        ability to go in- depth into certain aspects of life under the scope of 
        &quot;the city. &quot; A line in this particular track, &quot;And everyone 
        wants to break bread / and get ahead / but when the sun comes up, somebody 
        always lays dead&quot; shows that the neglect of consumerism is depicted 
        by the never-ending death that goes on in the city, yet there are the 
        resources to prevent it. Infectious Organisms's ability to put forth incredibly 
        conscious lyrics is the core of their music. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If that wasn't enough, Infectious Organisms's purely organic sound is 
        a out of body experience. The important track to mention is &quot;Comfort 
        in the Swell,&quot; a complete instrumental done by Infectious Organisms 
        that displays their solo ability to create great sounding and relaxing 
        jazz and hip hop fusion. It uses some soft-sounding chimes to bring in 
        the track, and slowly adds a varied guitar picking and medium-paced hip-hop 
        backbeat. This is the making of an incredible interlude to the album and 
        a track that could be played over and over at spoken word joints all over. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Infectious Organisms has made its living on paying royalties to the subscribers 
        of &quot;true&quot; hip-hop culture. The Richmond, Virginia hip-hop group 
        has started playing together in 1996 to the fans who were truly more involved 
        with the politics and cleverness of hip hop culture. Organisms's choice 
        to start with smaller venues has created a dedicated fan base that has 
        an incredible potential to expand. This is a must for any hip-hop enthusiast 
        and is for any believer that chill music with ill poetry can be fused 
        together to instruct thousands. </p>
