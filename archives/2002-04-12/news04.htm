      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bates rape unnerves students<br>
        <font size="2">JAMES FISHER</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Security forces, including police officers, flooded the 
        Bates campus following the rape of a female student there last weekend. 
        Long-term measures, including installation of a ID card-based building 
        access system, are likely to follow, said Bates administrators.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The student told police she was forced into a women's bathroom 
        in Pettengill Hall, a centrally located building on the Bates campus. 
        She said that her attacker held a sharp object to her throat. The student 
        was raped just after midnight on Friday, April 5. Pettengill houses a 
        large atrium, which is a popular study spot for late-night studying, said 
        Director of College Relations Brian McNulty. The identity of the attacker 
        is unknown, but police released a sketch of the suspect based on the victim's 
        description.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a message to the student body, President Donald Harward 
        said that at the time of the attack, a security guard was at the front 
        desk and making rounds of the building, including the bathrooms, every 
        hour. Dean of Students Celeste Branham said that the building was open 
        24 hours a day during the pre-exam and exam periods as a student study 
        space. Normally, she said, the doors would be locked at midnight.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bates hired Lewiston police officers to patrol the campus 
        last weekend after the rape. Branham said that police officers will continue 
        to be posted in Pettengill and other buildings throughout the exam period, 
        which ends this Saturday.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Harward pledged to &quot;re-examine all elements of our 
        campus systems and structures with regard to the security of our students.&quot; 
        Branham said that the college had been considering a &quot;one-card access 
        system&quot; to its buildings, and that &quot;we are very likely at this 
        time to move in that direction.&quot; Currently, Bates students have key 
        access to their own dorms, but cannot use their keys or ID cards to enter 
        other locked buildings.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Lewiston Sun Journal reported Wednesday that Lewiston 
        police have identified suspects &quot;inside and outside the Bates community.&quot; 
        Branham sent an email message to all students Wednesday morning specifically 
        denying the Sun Journal report. She said that detectives told her they 
        have no suspects related to the college, and are pursuing external leads.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bates students have been shaken by the assault. &quot;Bates 
        isn't a bubble,&quot; said Adrienne Eaton, a member of the Women's Resource 
        Center, &quot;and unfortunately, things like this happen.&quot; Student 
        groups and administrators have organized discussions for students on the 
        subject. &quot;We are trying to work as a community, regaining safety, 
        and supporting each other,&quot; said Anne Barlow, who coordinates Bates' 
        Students Against Sexual Assault organization.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lewiston police are also investigating a second sexual assault 
        that occurred last weekend in a downtown parking lot. Detectives do not 
        believe that the two incidents are related.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The rape was the second major crime to touch the Bates campus 
        this semester. In early March, senior Morgan McDuffee was killed during 
        a fight in downtown Lewiston. Police arrested Brandon Thongsavanh, a Lewiston 
        resident, and charged him with McDuffee's murder. His trial is pending.</p>
