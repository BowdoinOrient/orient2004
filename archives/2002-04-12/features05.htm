        ALUMNUS WRITER </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> My stint at the San Francisco Post Office came to an end 
        sometime in February '68, a horrible year for me and America. First came 
        the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., followed by that of Bobby 
        Kennedy, violent protests during the Democratic Convention in Chicago, 
        and- to cap it all off- the election of Richard Nixon as President. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On a personal level, King's assassination meant that Ronald, 
        just a friend now as far as I was concerned, decided he could no longer 
        be even that. Having come under the influence of the Oakland-based Black 
        Panthers, Ron, who'd passed for white in the army, suddenly became militantly 
        black. It was the end of more than a beautiful friendship. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Politically too, King's death came as a real shock. With 
        him it seemed the country's conscience was gone, both concerning race 
        and the war. <br>
        The only politician courageous enough to say the U.S. must get out of 
        Vietnam, at almost any price, was Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy, 
        about to enter the race for the nomination as his party's candidate for 
        President. The &quot;Peace Candidate,&quot; he was called. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When Lyndon Johnson announced he wasn't going to seek re-election, 
        Bobby Kennedy threw his hat in the ring too. Being from neighboring Massachusetts, 
        Bobby, came in ahead of McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary, but also 
        possibly because he took a hawkish stance on U.S. involvement in the war. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But in Oregon, with McCarthy winning a famous victory, their 
        positions were reversed. Everything now depended on California, the biggest 
        prize in the primary contest between the two leading Democratic candidates. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Being passionately opposed to the war, I naturally backed 
        the Peace Candidate. After all, I had taken part in demonstrations against 
        the President, on a visit to San Francisco, shouting Hey, hey, hey, LBJ, 
        how many kids did you kill today? and picketed Chief of Staff General 
        Maxwell Taylor outside the Fairmont Hotel. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The time had come to take a stand. So I went down to the 
        Citizens for McCarthy headquarters on Market Street to volunteer my services. 
        They asked me to distribute leaflets, and to help decorate the Cow Palace 
        with flags and bunting in advance of a big speech the senator was going 
        to make to kick off his California primary campaign. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On my way down to Nellie's at Carmel for the weekend, I 
        stopped off at Monterey Airport where Bobby Kennedy, on a flying tour 
        round the state, was to hold a rally. A big crowd had already gathered 
        on the tarmac. So I climbed onto the flat roof of the one-story building 
        to get a better view, with no one preventing me from doing so. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Bobby spoke from the gangplank of his plane, with the 
        familiar twang and gestures of the Kennedys, cracking jokes just like 
        JFK too, I couldn't help thinking that if I had a gun and the guts I could 
        easily have picked him off from my exposed vantage point. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then came the terrible news that a Jordanian named Sirhan 
        Sirhan had shot Kennedy at the Biltmore Hotel in L.A., where his supporters 
        were celebrating their candidate's 2-1 victory over McCarthy. The shooting 
        was witnessed by many people on live TV, including Bobby's 13-year-old 
        son, who recently died of an overdose. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My God, Nellie said, what is happening to our country? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Actually there are parallels to what is happening to it 
        today I think, even though the U.S. has just won a big military victory 
        in its war on terrorism and has a President far to the right, even of 
        Nixon. Then, as now, anyone questioning the war was labeled a traitor 
        by right-wingers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Particularly suspect were the 'peaceniks' on U.S. campuses, 
        the leading one among them Berkeley, headquarters of the anti-war movement. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One day while sitting in a caf&eacute; on Berkeley's Telegraph 
        Avenue, myself still with longish hair looking like a student I suppose, 
        someone, without asking my permission, took a picture of me with a Minox. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I nearly flipped out. Instantly, my paranoia returned. It 
        must have been an FBI agent, I thought. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It got so bad that when I saw a team of telephone company 
        workers digging up the street right outside my house, I thought they were 
        doing so on orders of the FBI, to tap my telephone: paranoia without rhyme 
        or reason. <br>
        All right, I thought, if they think I'm a spy I'll act like one, and afterwards 
        expose them. So, I decided to decamp to New York, but by a circuitous 
        route meant to make them think I was trying to put them off the scent. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Without saying goodbye to either Alice, Nellie, or my sister 
        in L.A., I took a bus to Phoenix, Arizona. Here I changed to one bound 
        for Denver, caught a plane to Chicago, continuing by train to New York: 
        intelligent enough not to think I was the Emperor of China, but conceited 
        enough to be convinced I was mistakenly considered an important spy. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having got myself a temporary job at Doubleday's on Fifth 
        Avenue, not far from Tiffany's, I went to hear Black Panther Eldridge 
        Cleaver speak at a Humphrey rally, introduced by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr..<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fuck Nixon, Cleaver shouted, poor Arthur looking distinctly 
        embarrassed. <br>
        Among bestsellers that fall was John LeCarr&eacute;e's Small Town in Germany, 
        a story of intrigue and espionage set in Bonn, then still the capital. 
        Every time I was asked for the title, I thought it might be an agent trying 
        to tell me to come out of the cold.</p>
