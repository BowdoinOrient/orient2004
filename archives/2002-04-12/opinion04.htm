        <font size="2">CONOR WILLIAMS</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> My night was supposed to be spent writing an essay on John 
        Stuart Mill's &quot;harm principle.&quot; However, after hearing Jackson 
        Katz-Safe Space's keynote speaker for Sexual Assault Awareness Week-I've 
        been finding myself unable to stay focused. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, I've begun to integrate the two topics. Mill's 
        principle provides that all individual speech and actions are allowable 
        to the extent that they do not harm other individuals. Beyond that point, 
        society may regulate liberty. <br>
        It's an interesting theory, attractive in its simplicity. In practice, 
        however, this becomes thorny, particularly within issues of hate speech, 
        where the harm inflicted on the receiver becomes increasingly nebulous 
        as it gets entangled with social normality and concern for free expression.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That said, Katz's lecture becomes relevant to my expressed 
        purpose for the night (writing that paper). How harmful is hate speech 
        that objectifies or typecasts the role of women in society? How dangerous 
        are the music videos showing males dominating and controlling females? 
        Is pornography merely a diversion to release tension behind closed doors? 
        How much harm should be necessary to warrant active control?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A convincing case can be made that the consistent psychological 
        harm done to the self-images of women should be enough to neccessitate 
        speech control. Simultaneously, many decry such arguments, suggesting 
        that impressing control on language would unnecessarily limit free speech. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is a substantial body of work, however, to suggest 
        that the speech and actions in question contribute considerably to violence 
        against women. Over 99 percent of rapists are men; certainly society's 
        acquiescence has had a large role in molding such a threatening situation 
        for women today.<br>
        Societal tolerance of the pressures and prejudices creates this unequal 
        balance. Even ludicrous declarations, like those questioning the validity 
        of women's suffrage, can affect the mindsets of both men and women, particularly 
        when compiled with the mass of images contributing to personal prejudices 
        and stereotypes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These very same critics often incorrectly apply the harm 
        principle to justify opposition to those speaking loudly for the cause 
        of womanhood, the radical &quot;feminazis.&quot; They play upon social 
        apathy toward the subjection of women in speech and media, relying on 
        deep-set prejudices. Calls for women's groups to &quot;stop seeking sexual 
        harassment&quot; exemplify these critics' reliance on the inertia of majority 
        opinion. Those who threaten the status quo invariably cause discomfort 
        among those resistant to change, but in no way does this constitute harm 
        or trigger Mill's principle. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A member of the audience challenged Katz's frustration with 
        the lack of male interest in working to take initiative in the fight to 
        improve the image of women in society. He questioned whether the provocative 
        elements of feminism could make males uncomfortable about attending speakers 
        or getting involved with the movement. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I can't speak for all men, but for me, that's a weak position, 
        a last refuge for those unwilling to take up the cause when their help 
        is most urgently needed. Sure, it's tough to stand against some of the 
        egregious behavior that is customarily tolerated. Feminists can (and do) 
        cross the line from constructive criticism to angry denunciation of the 
        suppressing factors. Katz addressed this, after having female members 
        of the audience list precautions they take to prevent sexual assault. 
        After they compiled a substantial list, he questioned the men, &quot;Wouldn't 
        YOU be angry if you lived under these sorts of pressures?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This is a fight where males have yet to pull their weight. 
        It's been our turn to pick up the slack for quite some time, fellas. Each 
        of us, myself included, can do a great deal to provide a healthier, less 
        threatening atmosphere for women on Bowdoin's campus. You know what we 
        have to do: challenge our friends when they (even jokingly) refer to or 
        treat women as objects, refuse to lower ourselves to taking advantage 
        of women impaired by alcohol-pretty common sense stuff.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sure, it won't be comfortable; we may encounter residual 
        anger from women who are suspicious of our motives, or mockery from men 
        too afraid to stand up. Still, the time has come for a change. It's time 
        for us to show true strength by choosing to stick out by respecting the 
        daughters, sisters, mothers, and wives in our lives.</p>
