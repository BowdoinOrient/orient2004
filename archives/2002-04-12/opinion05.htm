      <p align="left"><font size="5">We need new customs- like hibernation</font><font size="5"><br>
        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> The great Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once quipped 
        to a few friends gathered around pints of Carlsberg in a Copenhagen caf&eacute;, 
        &quot;People commonly travel around the world to see rivers and mountains, 
        new stars, birds of rare plumage, queerly deformed fish, ridiculous breeds 
        of men-they abandon themselves to the bestial stupor which gapes at existence, 
        and they think they have seen something.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I think that Kierkegaard might be right about the way some 
        people travel. They rush off to places for two days, run to museums, run 
        to this square or that brothel, then hop on a train and head for the next 
        spot, where they again defile the local pulse with torn McDonald's wrappers 
        and loud untimely Steve Austin quotes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I am as guilty of this as the next guy, but I have taken 
        my travel slow enough to realize that things function differently in different 
        places. I was amazed when I got to Spain and did not sit down to dinner 
        until 9:30 p.m., and was unable to buy things during certain hours because 
        of siesta. Imagine how a Spaniard would feel when he came to Bowdoin and 
        rushed off to the dining hall at 5:15 p.m. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the other hand, if this Spaniard got hungry at other 
        times during the day a store would be open because we do not have siesta 
        in America. It works both ways. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of my favorite European cultural staples is the consistent 
        absence of open container laws. From Camden Town in the heart of London 
        all the way to the Charles Bridge in Prague, Europeans have the right 
        to drink beer outside. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think this makes 
        a ton of sense. Who out there doesn't like to drink beer outside? Would 
        you rather enjoy a bottle of Rolling Rock or a tepid glass of Natural 
        Ice or even a martini on a city bench, or in some dingy, trash-filled, 
        barren-walled apartment? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of this is to say that I think America needs to make 
        a concerted effort to be a better, more relaxed place to live. We need 
        to begin to cultivate American culture. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I understand why Europeans give Americans sass about our 
        nation's infancy. We are a young country, but with a little imagination, 
        we can use this to our advantages. Rather then settling for age-old customs 
        that are antiquated and boring, we have the luxury of creating new ones. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As we look down upon the rest of the world from our comfortable 
        perch atop Mount Hegemony, Americans must realize that they are the cultivators 
        of global values and that it is our job to define the times in which we 
        are superior. So far, all we have to show the world is the death penalty, 
        an irrational drug war, an arrogant foreign policy, and a hardworking 
        sexually prudish polity. This needs to change.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My first proposal is a way to deal with these nasty life-denying 
        winters. I know I have dealt with this topic before, but with the recent 
        adjustment of the clocks and the abundance of life-affirming daylight 
        hours, I have realized that we can do something about the terrible effects 
        of Maine winters. I am proposing the institution of human hibernation. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I am willing to accept that October and November are reasonable 
        months. I do not mind waking up on a brisk Sunday in November, nor do 
        I mind Thanksgiving. Halloween has to stay, and I think it is important 
        for people to witness the death of the leaves. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In my plan, December would also be left intact, but it would 
        be drastically reworked, turning the dark, cold month into a period of 
        festivals, debauchery, and contemplation. December 1 would be a major 
        holiday marking the kickoff of 17 to 20 days of hedonism. Each day would 
        be filled with extravagant feasts, which would give people a chance to 
        fatten up and relax with the people they care about. The festivals would 
        stop in time for religious observances, and more solemn and moderated 
        feasts would lead us through Christmas and toward the New Year. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a society, we would celebrate New Year's per usual and 
        then head off for hibernation. The sleep would last for all of January, 
        February, and most of March. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">March 21 and the following several days would be spent waking 
        up. The grogginess that accompanies one's daily arousal from bed would 
        be magnified exponentionally over the course of the 11-week hibernation, 
        mandating a 7-10 day period in which people slowly adjust to natural light 
        and the other elements of &quot;normal existence.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">April 1 would be another huge national holiday, and a weeklong 
        party would welcome everyone back to consciousness. On April 8, our society 
        would return to normalcy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">You might find these suggestions extreme but they make a 
        great deal of sense. It is not that the Maine winter is that bad, it's 
        just that people expect us to &quot;do things&quot; during it. No level 
        of productivity is natural during the harsh winter, a point that is hammered 
        home by the vibrancy we all feel when the sun finally comes out in mid-April. 
        All I am really doing is articulating the natural urge inside all of us 
        to simply eat and sleep through the winter.</p>
