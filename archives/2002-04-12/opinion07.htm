        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> First Monica and Chandler, now Joey and Rachel. It's becoming 
        part of the comedy of Friends-that the six people will eventually all 
        discover their love for each other and pair off. At the same time, Jerry 
        and Elaine on Seinfeld didn't really care about each other until they'd 
        stopped being friends, and then refused to date. Go figure.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Earlier this year, I wrote a column about whether or not 
        men and women can really be friends, and concluded that they can. Well, 
        here's the other side of that coin-IS IT A GOOD IDEA FOR FRIENDS TO DATE?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Absolutely. Best idea ever,&quot; Jamal declares. 
        When one dates a friend, they can skip over the awkwardness of getting 
        to know each other. And the two already know that they are somewhat compatible; 
        they know the areas in which they disagree as well. What could be better 
        than to base a relationship on comfort and trust?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If it turned out as well as it did for Monica and Chandler-that 
        is, the two discover that they are both equally in love with each other-then 
        all will be well. Unfortunately, that is not always the case.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sometimes, the friendship may be hindered by one-sided feelings. 
        In the case of Brad and Serena, their friendship has degraded to the point 
        that it seems to be based entirely on Brad trying to convince Serena to 
        go out with him. Once, last year, she tried it out and realized that while 
        she likes spending time with him, she really just does not feel that way 
        about him. Upon their breakup, which Brad did not take particularly well, 
        he decided that she hadn't realized what she did by breaking up with him 
        and has spent the ensuing two years trying to persuade her of such.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was such a mistake,&quot; she says. &quot;If I 
        had never given in, and agreed to see what it was like-against my instincts, 
        I might add-he probably would have just gotten over the crush and we would 
        have been fine as friends. But as it is, I doubt we can ever really be 
        nice, normal friends again.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of course it is entirely possible for one friend's crush 
        to turn into a life-changing love. Abby tried to dismiss George's crush 
        on her until she realized that she liked him as well- they now debate 
        where they will live together when they graduate. The difference between 
        Abby and Serena is that Abby realized she did in fact return George's 
        feelings, whereas Serena just felt pressured to go out with Brad so he 
        would stop bugging her about it. Abby did what felt right to her and she 
        is now the happier of the two.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unrequited crushes like Brad's are often the result of friends 
        being &quot;more than just friends.&quot; Oftentimes two friends can hook 
        up once or twice without any real damage. But the increase in number of 
        hookups is directly proportional to the increase in potential heartbreak. 
        It's very easy for someone to be confused if they are acting as if they 
        are in a relationship by spending a lot of quality time with a person 
        they feel very close to AND going home with them every night. The long 
        and wonderful friendship of two such people I know was recently destroyed 
        because Buck thought that they were just hooking up-albeit, quite a lot-and 
        Sarah began to develop a love beyond their camaraderie. She will never 
        be able to feel the same way about him again after he rejected her romantically.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Carrie comes from having started out as quite good friends 
        with Jackson before they dated for a long time. &quot;After we broke up, 
        it took nearly a year for us to be able to really become friends again. 
        It was pretty rough at times right after the breakup. There were many 
        times I wished that we had just stayed friends and never subjected ourselves 
        to the hazards of a relationship.&quot; So was it worth it? &quot;I don't 
        know. I don't know if I'd date such a close friend like that again, unless 
        I really believed that it was true love. &quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kitty, on the other hand, loves to date her male friends 
        briefly because she feels they will never get the sexual tension out of 
        the way if they don't. She finds that she and the friends that she has 
        dated end up becoming closer in the long run because they never have to 
        deal with the possibility of attraction because they know what it's like. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is one thing to date someone one is friendly with. But 
        there is a great difference between a &quot;friendship&quot; consisting 
        of repeated conversations in line at the keg and a real bond. The first 
        case, where two people might realize that they have a lot in common, may 
        be the best possible foundation for a happy relationship. The more involved 
        friendship is something to be cherished, however, and possible repercussions 
        should be weighed in decisions about turning friendships to relationships. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So perhaps for every Monica and Chandler who fall in love 
        and marry after years of friendship, and a Jerry and Elaine who become 
        closer friends after having dated, there is a Joey who will pine after 
        a Rachel, thereby ruining the precious camaraderie. (I don't even want 
        to begin to think about Rachel's relationship with Ross). Just think about 
        it before you plunge into something that might have long-term consequences. 
        As far as I am concerned, anything is worth it for true love, but barring 
        that, you might want to think about if you'd rather leave Bowdoin with 
        lots of friends or lots of exes.</p>
