        <font size="2">PATRICK ROCKEFELLER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> From the French to the international community to the op-ed 
        page of The New York Times, the Bush administration has been maligned 
        for being too militarily &quot;unilateral&quot;-as if that were a bad 
        thing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This is hardly new. From the time of George Washington, 
        America has been wary of entangling alliances. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is no doubt that calling Bush a &quot;unilateralist 
        cowboy&quot; or other such epithets is intended to make Americans feel 
        shame for ignoring the wishes of European elites, but the rest of the 
        world did not elect Bush; he was elected by Americans to serve American 
        interests. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This is usually the point where Alec Baldwin, a mediocre 
        actor and intellectual featherweight, stands up and shouts that Bush wasn't 
        elected at all. But just as surely as Baldwin moves his lips and follows 
        the words with his finger when he reads, most rational people have gotten 
        over this argument long ago. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Much European criticism comes from the need to feel included. 
        In ages past, Europe was the military center of the world, warring within 
        its borders and in colonies abroad. However, since the end of WWII, America 
        has grown in power and Europe has shrunk in relative strength and influence. 
        Today, America acts unilaterally because the French and British militaries 
        would be of very little help fighting alongside American troops. In fact, 
        they would be more of a hindrance. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">America spends more on her military than the next 19 biggest-spending 
        countries combined. The U.S. diverts about 3 percent of its approximately 
        $10 trillion GDP to defense, while the European average is about 1.5 percent 
        of significantly smaller GDPs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This creates a discrepancy in military strength that prevents 
        other countries from being effective additions to American forces. When 
        Bill Kristol spoke at the College, he compared the inclusion of other 
        nations in the war in Afghanistan to letting a couple of high school basketball 
        players suit up with Maryland in the championship game.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Gulf War was viewed as an achievement for multilateralism 
        and the international community. Dozens of nations committed troops and 
        aid, but ultimately, America did almost all of the fighting. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While it looked nice to have all the flags flying together, 
        one of the adverse consequences was the inability of President Bush Sr. 
        to push troops into Baghdad, because the Arab nations of the coalition 
        would have pulled out. Just imagine if Hussein had been expelled 10 years 
        ago. We wouldn't have to worry about him building weapons of mass destruction 
        or inciting violence in Israel by offering $25,000 to the families of 
        suicide bombers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The fact is, America does not have to solicit support or 
        approval from other countries because it can do it alone. America can 
        fight a war in Afghanistan, Iraq, or the Taiwan Strait without them. So, 
        really, the burden is on the other nations to offer some advantage that 
        would convince the U.S. that multilateralism is better. It is not the 
        responsibility of the U.S. to include them like an older brother reluctantly 
        bringing his kid brother to a ballgame with him. If these countries don't 
        want to finance a military, there are still ways they can be involved; 
        through intelligence gathering, financial aid, and medical help. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ultimately, America must act in its own best interest, as 
        all countries do. It is up to Europeans to decide whether they are able 
        or willing to remain militarily relevant (an issue for another time). 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, if France won't support Israel, instead employing ambassadors 
        that refer to it as &quot;that shitty little country,&quot; that's fine. 
        But America will proceed without it. America will continue to defend its 
        interests, and those of its allies. America will, in the words of Winston 
        Churchill, fight &quot;&#133;to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary 
        for years, if necessary alone.&quot;</p>
