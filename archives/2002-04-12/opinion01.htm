        There are moments in my sometimes-embittered Bowdoin career when I think 
        to myself, &quot;Yeah...this is what it's about.&quot; The panel discussion 
        on sexual harassment was, for me, one of those moments. And, from my admittedly 
        idealistic standpoint, &quot;what it's about&quot; is simply this: that 
        a good part of our Bowdoin educations needs to be the active engagement 
        of perspectives other than those we claim as our own-for the purposes 
        of honestly working and reworking what we think about the world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Let me take it out of the theoretical realm a bit and address 
        the real gains I feel the panel has allowed us to start making. Aside 
        from publicly debunking the notions that both so-called &quot;feminists&quot; 
        and &quot;conservatives&quot; on campus are just crazies on opposite ends 
        of the political spectrum, I felt that the panel raised the invisible 
        and sometimes uncomfortable specter of the &quot;culture of Bowdoin.&quot; 
        It allowed folks to consider-if only briefly-the fact that there's something 
        very fundamental about Bowdoin's social atmosphere that continues to make 
        sexual harassment and assault at best invisible and at worst acceptable. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sexual harassment and sexual assault do happen at Bowdoin, 
        but they remain on the down-low. Why? After participating in the panel, 
        it's clear to me that there's no single response. Concrete gains from 
        the panel included the proposition of an anonymous report form for sexual 
        harassment similar to the one already available for sexual assault, further 
        discussion of the fuzzy line between sexual harassment and flirting or 
        &quot;showing interest,&quot; and clarification of sexual harassment and 
        assault policies-for example, in cases where alcohol is involved (see 
        the Student Handbook, available online, for more information).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From where I'm standing (and I plant my feet firmly in the 
        &quot;feminist&quot; identity for several reasons), the panel successfully 
        addressed what is often billed as &quot;merely&quot; a &quot;women's issue&quot; 
        in ways that made sense to self-described feminists and non-feminists 
        alike. My hope is that-to borrow a phrase from UCC doctrine-such &quot;open 
        and affirming&quot; discourse will allow individuals from all locations 
        on the political spectrum to consider extremely important but oft-marginalized 
        issues like sexual harassment. The panel indicated that these issues are, 
        indeed, not simply &quot;women's issues&quot;; rather, they inform the 
        experiences of the women and men of the Bowdoin community. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And once again-thanks to all who participated in the discussion 
        with open minds and a desire to make things better. Y'all rock my world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="2"></a><font size="2"><b>TODD BUELL</b></font><br>
        Our panel discussion was a success beyond anything I could have imagined. 
        Not only did the campus show a favorable interest in the subject matter, 
        but contributions from both panel and audience members were beneficial 
        in gauging the problem of sexual harassment at Bowdoin and finding solutions.<br>
        One good idea suggested at the panel was the installment of anonymous 
        sexual harassment report forms like the ones currently provided by the 
        Dean's office for sexual assault. Dean Bradley said the office had never 
        considered such a proposal but felt it was definitely something worth 
        pondering. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I believe anonymous report forms are a good idea but we 
        must not hastily implement them without specifically articulating both 
        their appropriate and inappropriate use. Since the forms will be anonymous, 
        the student body must understand that one cannot use them for adjudicatory 
        purposes. One cannot make formal accusations against someone anonymously. 
        That is a basic tenet not only of our constitution, but also of our school's 
        judicial code.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Therefore survivors should still be encouraged to speak 
        to a dean about incidents where they have been victimized by sexual harassment, 
        since such conferences are the only avenue for a formal resolution of 
        the problem-whether through mediation or punitive action. Nonetheless, 
        if simply describing an incident without using names makes a survivor 
        more comfortable, that option should be available in lieu of a formal 
        meeting with a dean.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After the panel, someone approached me and said that the 
        panel should go to the Middle East and help them find common ground in 
        their conflict. Though that task may best be left to Colin Powell and 
        other professional diplomats, I was honored to know that the audience 
        appreciated our attempt to address a contentious topic in an open and 
        respectful manner.<br>
      </p>

        Through my (almost) four years at Bowdoin, I have thought a lot about 
        the usefulness of academic tools. What is the true meaning and value of 
        engaging in academic discourse? How is it applicable to the &quot;real 
        world?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of the essential criticisms that I have always had and 
        continue to have for certain forms of academic language and dialogue is 
        that it doesn't reach people-it is too removed from individual lives and 
        realities. And if it can't reach people, then how can it ever be effective? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">By replacing purely emotional reactions with discussion 
        founded in academic ideas, Todd, Clare, and I were able to communicate 
        about the intensely personal issue of sexual harassment in a respectful 
        and non-reactionary way. The panel on sexual harassment that we (and others) 
        put together was an attempt-I think a successful one-at opening up that 
        dialogue to the wider community.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">College gives us the opportunity to grow academically by 
        questioning our perceptions of the world. But, perhaps more importantly, 
        it gives us the space to do so through the process of questioning the 
        opinions of others and having them challenge ours. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As we all discovered by way of the panel, Bowdoin is a community 
        that is far more open to this process that many of us realize.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I therefore strongly encourage any and all Bowdoin students 
        to use the academic tools that this institution gives us and apply them 
        to both public and private discussion about differing viewpoints; it is 
        these interactions that make living and learning in a small community 
        a valuable experience.<br>
