      <p align="left"> Facing some of the coldest conditions the team had seen 
        in a long time, the Bowdoin Crew Team rowed its way to success last Saturday 
        in Worcester, Massachusetts. After returning from Spring Break in sunny 
        Summerton, South Carolina, the team was not looking forward to rowing 
        on the cold and windy Lake Quinsigamond. But without missing a beat, the 
        team picked up where it left off last fall: as a strong program claiming 
        several key victories. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men's side displayed strength and skill in defeating 
        crews from the University of Vermont and Brandeis. With three varsity 
        men's boats, Coach Gil Birney was excited to have such a competitive group 
        of rowers. His first boat, stroked by Will LoVerme '02, has been rowing 
        spring races together since last year, and their experience showed. With 
        new coxswain Ben &quot;Benny&quot; Needham '05, the first team rowed a 
        strong race and finished first in a time of 6:47. This race served as 
        a reunion between Loverme and Tom Scifres '03, Tyler Lange '03 and Gordon 
        Clarke '03, both of whom spent the fall semester abroad. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second and third varsity men rowed impressive races 
        as well: Chad Pelton's second men claimed a first place finish in their 
        race with an impressive time of 7:00. The third men, stroked by Justin 
        Clarke '04 were just behind them at 7:12. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Coach Birney was also pleased with his varsity women. Though 
        the first women's boat is made up of three sophomores and one junior, 
        it showed poise and confidence as it faced perennial rival Vermont. Followed 
        by Alicia Smith '04, Jess Rueben '05, and Katie Chandler '04, stroke Sadie 
        Anderson '04 led the women to a hard-earned victory over Vermont, Assumption, 
        and Brandeis. Though in somewhat of a rebuilding stage, the women had 
        a very strong start to the season. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not far behind the varsity women came Birney's novice women. 
        The boat, stroked by sophomore Allie Craig, is made up of four first-year 
        rowers, including Kacy Karlen '05 who joined the team just before spring 
        break. The boat finished in first place and far ahead of Assumption by 
        40 seconds. Coxswain Meredith Harris '05 said, &quot;I'm enormously proud 
        of the novice women for our first win of the season. They worked incredibly 
        hard over the past few weeks. I know that we are all looking forward to 
        more success in the races ahead.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's novice men were also uncontested in their first 
        race of the season. They beat rival Assumption by nearly a minute. Birney 
        and his rowers attribute much of their early success to the two weeks 
        spent at an intensive rowing camp in South Carolina. The team practiced 
        twice a day in the 80-degree weather, which was quite a difference from 
        last year's Spring Break that was spent on the icy New Meadows River in 
        Brunswick. Many of them were excited to get a jump on their training. 
        One novice rower remarked, &quot;Our commitment to early season training, 
        particularly our time spent rowing in South Carolina over spring break, 
        gave us a competitive edge over our opponents this weekend, and hopefully 
        will for the rest of the season.&quot; This training will become particularly 
        important as Bowdoin heads into the New England Fours Championship and 
        the Dad Vail Regatta in May. But for now, the team will focus its efforts 
        on a double header in Amherst, Massachusetts this Saturday, and Lowell 
        on Sunday.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Coming soon to a river near you: Bowdoin will take on Colby 
        and Bates in the annual CBB President's Cup Challenge. This year's race 
        will be held at Colby on April 21.</p>
