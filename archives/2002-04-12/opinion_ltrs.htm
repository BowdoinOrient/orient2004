      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, we dropped the Smooth Words contest on the Bowdoin community. 
        The contest challenged students, faculty, and staff to come up with the 
        best way to ask a partner for permission to have sex. Many states, including 
        Maine, require that males and females receive consent before engaging 
        in sexual activity. Verbal consent is the safest way to ensure that both 
        individuals understand each other's intentions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Few people are aware of or consider the laws requiring consent. There 
        are also those on campus who believe that having laws requiring permission 
        is constraining and a hindrance to traditional relationships. We hope 
        that the contest caused them to reconsider their views and realize that 
        verbal consent is the best way to prevent a miscommunication from leading 
        to disaster.</p>
      <p>If you have trouble finding the smooth words while you're getting your 
        groove on, then you can take a hint from our winners. And the winners 
        are&#133;(drum roll):<br>
      </p>
      <p>First Prize: &quot;Mmmmmmm, ahhhhhh...you just turn me on, it feels so 
        good, and it also feels so good that we can talk about it, tell each other 
        how good it is without ever feeling stupid or embarrassed. I want to make 
        sweet lovin' to you mi amor!! I want to make love passionately, softly, 
        quickly, slowly, sweetly, wildly, endlessly, orgasmically, and in every 
        style and position we know and dare to do!! So what do you say, are you 
        up for the challenge? Want to come...along with me?&quot; -Mayte Blasco 
        '02<br>
      </p>
      <p>Second Prize: &quot;How you doing sweetie? (pause for response) You are 
        so beautiful. I love touching you-it makes me feel so good. (pause, a 
        kiss, slowly) I want to feel you inside me. (making eye contact) I want 
        to make love with you. (holding eye contact, gently) If you don't want 
        to we can just snuggle and you can sleep in my arms, or we can touch each 
        other some more until we both come if you want. I've already told you 
        I'm on the pill and I have condoms right here by the bed. What do you 
        want, sweetheart? Just tell me. (pause for response).&quot; -Anonymous 
        (Note: It is also important to remember that the partner should also give 
        his or her partner the option of whether or not they want to cuddle.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Third Prize: &quot;This is amazing for me and I want to be sure it's 
        amazing for you too. Would it be OK if we had sex? I don't want this to 
        be any less incredible for you.&quot; -Margaret Magee '02<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you to everyone who submitted. We hope that our contest improved 
        campus awareness and understanding of the issue of consent and has sparked 
        meaningful conversation about sexual relationships. In addition, we hope 
        that requesting consent becomes an accepted prerequisite to sex.</p>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Faculty took student opposition seriously</font></p>
      <p>To the editors:</p>
      <p>In last week's lead editorial, Belinda Lovett and Nicholas LoVecchio 
        compare the Faculty to a dog urinating on a tree. Indeed, they rate the 
        Faculty one lower than the dog, for Lovett and LoVecchio suggest that 
        the dog would stop urinating if the tree complained. And what was the 
        grave sin of the Faculty? What was the metaphorical equivalent the dog's 
        urinating? Simply this: the Faculty decided to add plusses and minuses 
        to the grading scale at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Lovett and LoVecchio argue that &quot;It is inexcusable that the Faculty 
        voted to institute a plus/minus grading system even though the change 
        is opposed by the students, the only people who are really affected by 
        the change.&quot; Their argument is evidently based on the following principle: 
        when it comes to decisions that mainly affect students, the Faculty should 
        not make any decision that is opposed by a majority of students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It would be quite a college in which the curricular and instructional 
        issues were all decided by majority vote of the students. In fact, of 
        course, the Faculty make countless decisions which principally affect 
        students. We impose distribution requirements; we require that students 
        have a major; we determine the requirements for each major; we decide 
        what courses will be offered; we decide what material to put on course 
        syllabi; we give paper topics, problem sets and exams; and we give grades. 
        All of this is completely paternalistic. Most of it is far more important 
        than whether or not a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot; appears as part 
        of your grade. And, strangely enough, none of it is decided simply by 
        polling the student body.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Every faculty member at the meeting took seriously the student opposition 
        to the change in grading scale. We listened to the arguments, both by 
        students and our colleagues. We evaluated the arguments. And then we did 
        what we thought was best-both educationally for our students and for the 
        purpose of reporting on student performance. Many students and a minority 
        of the Faculty still disagreed; indeed, I myself moved to undo the action, 
        for I thought that changes of this sort should be made only on the basis 
        of a more solid majority of the faculty. But the Orient's comparison of 
        Faculty to urinating dogs was needlessly inflammatory and completely unsupported 
        by any cogent argument.</p>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Recognizing others' right to dissent</font></p>
      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Last week, Gil Barndollar expressed his view that America's colleges 
        and universities are out of touch with the American mainstream. However, 
        one wonders exactly how impartial, or even how credible, anything concocted 
        by Frank Luntz actually is. Luntz is nothing more than a classic GOP hack. 
      </p>
      <p>In close coordination with then-speaker Gingrich, Luntz conducted extensive 
        polls, during which he floated a multitude of proposed Republican bills 
        toward those being surveyed. Those that received at least 60 percent support 
        were incorporated into the &quot;Contact with America&quot; program. Thus, 
        the survey was less a reflection of what the Republican Party fervently 
        believed than what it could sell to the public.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Dubious origin of the numbers aside, Barndollar is certainly correct 
        in that the majority of American people hold different opinions from educational 
        elites. Is this such a bad thing? I'm sure that Barndollar is quite concerned 
        about what he perceives as the trashing of the United States by a group 
        of ivory tower intellectuals, but is he really that afraid of different 
        points of view? Clearly, he must see value in going against the herd, 
        as that is what he attempts to do by using inflammatory Limbaugh-like 
        rhetoric to tell our student body and Faculty that we are terribly misguided. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>In reality, Barndollar, as a some-time writer for The Patriot (Bowdoin's 
        self-proclaimed organ of conservative dissent) has no problem going against 
        the grain-he merely detests it when it results in the expression of opinions 
        different from his own.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Considering the relatively miniscule number of conservatives on campus, 
        Bowdoin has made a commendable effort to draw conservative speakers and 
        lecturers to the college. Barndollar seems to think he is being stifled, 
        as is conservatism, on this campus. I disagree with his politics, but 
        since his article was printed in the Orient, I fail to see how he is being 
        denied his right to self-expression.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Lastly, I consider myself a patriot, a title that, last time I checked, 
        did not force someone to agree blindly with governmental policy. Barndollar 
        seems to think that voicing opposition to U.S. policy is some form of 
        disloyalty. I can only say that I find this McCarthy-like approach to 
        politics to be extremely frightening. No one should tell me what I can 
        and cannot think-to do so is to disrespect every soldier or sailor who 
        perished to defend our freedom from such ideological fanaticism, to discount 
        the entire principle of freedom of conscience, and to ruin American democracy 
        under the guise of saving it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I fully recognize and respect Barndollar's right to dissent. All I ask 
        is that he recognizes and respects my own right to do so.</p>
