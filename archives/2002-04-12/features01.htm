      <p align="left"><font size="5">Tyranny of the good</font><font size="5"><br>
        <font size="2">CHRISTOPHER SMITHWICK<br>
        STAFF WRITER </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> At a lecture held Tuesday entitled &quot;The Tyranny of 
        the Positive Attitude in America,&quot; Barry N. Wish Professor of Psychology 
        and Social Studies Barbara Held discussed the exponential growth of the 
        self-help industry in turn-of-the century America and the overwhelming 
        push for a positive attitude that underlies it. Professor Held reacted 
        to this trend in saying that it can cause more perils than promise for 
        many people. The talk was given to the Jung Seminar as an encore presentation 
        she gave to the Friends of Bowdoin in October.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Held, the tyranny lies in the pervasive attitude 
        that we must remain positive at all times and at all costs. It is found 
        in our most common aphorisms, including &quot;Cheer up! Things could be 
        worse,&quot; &quot;Stop complaining, it's not that bad,&quot; and &quot;Smile, 
        look on the bright side,&quot; and in that ubiquitous yellow smiley face 
        that adorns T-shirts and bumpers from coast to coast. But the tyranny 
        of the positive attitude is most present in self-help books based on some 
        form of positive thinking. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Most of the books which make sweeping claims to change 
        people's lives dramatically for the better have not been put to any systematic 
        empirical test,&quot; says Held. &quot;Moreover, if the advice given in 
        these books really worked,&quot; she adds, &quot;why do we have so many?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Held invited listeners to simply look on the shelves at 
        bookstores. Self-help books that continue to sell well include Norman 
        Vincent Peale's &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; and Dale Carnegie's 
        &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&quot; The self-help industry 
        reportedly makes 2.48 billion dollars every year, according to Newsweek 
        Magazine.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Held also said there are costs of accentuating the positive 
        and eliminating the negative, as many of these books tell readers to do, 
        so that the tyranny of the positive attitude may work paradoxically to 
        lower our sense of well-being. Some of the costs include feeling guilty 
        or defective when you can't be happy or feel good. &quot;I am not against 
        optimism, hope, or being positive,&quot; says Held. &quot;When being positive 
        works for you, be positive, but we should not be forced to be positive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor Held is the author of &quot;Stop Smiling, Start 
        Kvetching: A 5-Step Guide to Creative Complaining,&quot; published in 
        2001. Kvetching is a Yiddish term referring to venting, and should not 
        be mistaken for whining. Creative kvetching involves expressing to a willing 
        listener the inevitable pain of living. <br>
        &quot;Putting our pain into words allows us to organize and possibly come 
        to a new understanding of it, and we are then less likely to ruminate 
        over our pain,&quot; says Held. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The tyranny of the positive attitude manifests itself not 
        only in popular culture, but also in the positive psychology movement 
        that has emerged in the psychology profession. &quot;I am not saying there 
        is no role for therapists,&quot; says Held, &quot;but some people would 
        not need therapists if more people would listen empathically. Would there 
        be such a demand for professional empathy if we had more empathic listeners 
        in our everyday lives?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Held also used cross-cultural studies of the US and Japan 
        to support her argument. &quot;In the US,&quot; she says, &quot;a sense 
        of subjective well-being is linked to self-esteem and an inflated view 
        of oneself. In Japan, however, a capacity for self-criticism is what gives 
        people a sense of well-being.&quot; Therefore, achieving a sense of happiness 
        by way of seeing yourself in positive terms is not universal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Held referred to Wellesley Professor Julie Norem, author 
        of &quot;The Positive Power of Negative Thinking,&quot; who uses defensive 
        pessimism as her own preferred coping strategy. Held says defensive pessimists 
        set unrealistically low expectations for their performance on a task, 
        think of everything that could go wrong, and then think about ways of 
        avoiding those pitfalls. This is a strategic option that works for some 
        people by lowering debilitating anxiety. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;People should be allowed to use the coping strategy 
        that works for them,&quot; concludes Held. In reaction to Norem's claim 
        that &quot;One size does not fit all,&quot; Held simply responds: &quot;Why 
        should it?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor Held is a licensed clinical psychologist who has 
        been teaching at Bowdoin College since 1979. She is also the author of 
        &quot;Back to Reality: A Critique of Postmodern Theory in Psychotherapy.&quot;
