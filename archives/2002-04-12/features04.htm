      <p align="left"><font size="5">Tom Hyde's last campaign and the gray horse</font><font size="5"><br>
        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        COLUMNIST </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> After campaigning in northern Virginia for most of the 
        summer and leading cavalry raids around the Petersburg area, Thomas W. 
        Hyde, of the Bowdoin Class of 1861, was ordered, along with the Sixth 
        Corps of the Army of the Potomac, to board transports in early July?their 
        destination unknown.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A veteran of almost all the eastern battles of the Civil 
        War, Hyde remembered the rejuvenating freshness of the ocean air. It truly 
        gave a second wind to the troops who had been stuck in the dust and mud 
        of Petersburg for weeks. The men soon learned that they were headed to 
        Washington, D.C. A rebel raid led by General Jubal Early was pounding 
        at the gates of the Union capital. As the Sixth Corps disembarked and 
        raced through the streets towards the fighting near Fort Stevens, the 
        crowds cheered their arrival. The veteran troops quickly formed into battle 
        line. </p>
      <p align="left">After a swift but sharp engagement, the enemy was driven 
        from the field.<br>
        Following the rescue of Washington, the Sixth Corps was detailed to clear 
        out the Shenandoah Valley, the breadbasket of the Confederacy. Fighting 
        in the Valley had its dangers. Not only was there still a fierce Confederate 
        army to contend with but it was also the realm of the rebel guerilla John 
        Mosby, the infamous &quot;Grey Ghost.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde had a number of close calls but his adventures in the 
        Shenandoah were cut short when the enlistment for the 7th Maine ran out. 
        Riding home to Maine with his original regiment, Hyde was mustered out 
        of the Union Army near the end of 1864. But with the guns still firing 
        in Virginia, Hyde sought a commission as the colonel of the newly formed 
        First Maine Veteran Volunteers. He needed to get back into the field.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In this endeavor, Hyde was successful, but before he could 
        get his regiment together he was on the move again. Ulysses Grant had 
        promoted the energetic General Phil Sheridan to command the Union forces 
        in the Shenandoah. In a number of battles, Sheridan successfully pushed 
        back the Confederate Army and came close to destroying it at the Battle 
        of Cedar Creek in October of 1864.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde, upon reaching Washington, learned of the clash at 
        Cedar Creek and immediately longed to be a part of it. He rode through 
        the Valley, trying to catch up with Sheridan and described what the once 
        plentiful Shenandoah resembled:<br>
        <i>The country looked about as Germany may have looked after the Thirty 
        Years' War&#133;. All was stillness for fifteen miles; it was the abomination 
        of desolation, not even the 'low of cattle and song of birds.'</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde arrived not in time for the battle and was disappointed 
        that he had missed a chance for promotion. Still, he found himself the 
        ranking colonel in his brigade and was thus given its command. This was 
        the third brigade of Getty's Division, of the Sixth Army Corps, comprised 
        of six regiments (the 43rd, 49th, 77th, and 122nd New York Regiments, 
        the 61st Pennsylvania, and the First Maine Veteran Volunteers).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On December 10, 1864, the Sixth Army Corps was returned 
        to the Army of the Potomac around Petersburg. As the men set to work in 
        building their winter quarters, Hyde noted that:<br>
        <i>This time&#133;there was hope in the air; all were beginning to feel 
        that the next campaign would be the last, and most of the army now recognized 
        the fact that emancipation had been the end for which the war had been 
        permitted in the scheme of Providence.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde would have to wait till the new year before he got 
        to test his brigade in the field. During the fighting spaked by Lee's 
        attack on Federal-held Fort Stedman on March 25, 1865, Hyde's brigade 
        was called upon to counterattack the rebels. Twenty-four years old at 
        the time, Hyde wrote about his first ever experience as a brigade commander:<br>
        <i> I felt that the time had at last come, so often longed for, when it 
        should be settled whether I could command six regiments in action to my 
        own satisfaction. It was an unknown problem, a somewhat dreaded problem 
        too. It was not a question of danger at all, for in great responsibility, 
        personal danger is little thought of by any one. What is to be dreaded 
        is, not doing the right thing at the right time.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the end, Hyde should have been proud, for his brigade 
        did a commendable job.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde's second chance to see his men perform in battle came 
        soon afterwards on April 2nd. Following the rebel defeat at a crossroads 
        called Five Forks, Grant ordered a general assault all along the Petersburg 
        front. Hyde's 1,600 man brigade was chosen as the wedge of a Sixth Corps 
        storming column aimed at the vital Southside Railroad, behind enemy lines. 
        The ground he was to cover was filled with &quot;five formidable lines 
        of abattis.&quot; To counter these obstacles Hyde had a unit of ax-men 
        lead the charge, cutting their way as they advanced. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When the signal was given, the men in blue breached the 
        rebel lines, overcoming obstacles and fortifications. Hyde's men were 
        in the forefront, racing for the Southside railroad. With that cut, they 
        reformed and began chasing the retreating rebels. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The success of Hyde's men continued until the entire division 
        came to a halt near a hill, which was home to a fierce rebel battery. 
        Hyde noted that &quot;a fine-looking old officer, on a gray horse&quot; 
        was personally directing the movements of the guns. It was a last ditch 
        effort, Hyde could tell, for everywhere the rebel lines were crumbling. 
        Assigning a part of his brigade to flank the hill and shoot the artillery 
        horses, to prevent the guns from escaping, Hyde ordered his brigade to 
        charge towards the stronghold, crashing through a swamp. This time the 
        division successfully took the hill. Once on top of the guns, Hyde conversed 
        with a rebel officer, asking him who the man on the horse had been. &quot;General 
        Robert E. Lee,&quot; was the reply.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde was shocked by this answer. Surely, if he had moved 
        faster, he could have captured the Confederate general and ended the War 
        right then and there. But Hyde was too exhausted to beat himself up over 
        things that had not happened. He sank to the ground after nineteen hours 
        of fighting and marching and slept once reinforcements had come up to 
        relieve his weary brigade. The next morning he was on the move again. 
        Off the Sixth Corps went, chasing after Lee. It was a race that had but 
        one ending and the fate of the Confederacy was sealed on April 9, 1865, 
        when Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Courthouse.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde remembered that day:<br>
        <i>Toward noon a sudden stillness came. The usual thunder around the horizon 
        became strangely silent. It seemed as if we were marching into a vacuum. 
        I dashed ahead to see what it meant, and within a mile came upon our revered 
        division commander, General Getty, sitting under a tree, his face in his 
        hands. &quot;What is it, general?&quot; &quot;Lee has surrendered,&quot; 
        was the reply. I joined him on the ground, and&#133;tears fell&#133;</i><br>
      </p>
