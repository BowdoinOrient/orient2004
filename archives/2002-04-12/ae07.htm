      <p align="left">The Orient suprised the foodies with a request: to review 
        a restaurant featuring cross-cultural contamination. At first a little 
        daunted by the prospect of corned beef tacos and potato tortillas, the 
        foodies blindly accepted the challenge. After embracing Pedro's diverse 
        past, the foodies found Pedro O'Hara's, a strange amalgam of Irish and 
        Mexican influences. The Maine Street restaurant, despite a few kinks, 
        should become a fun student hangout. Hey yo, lets head to Pedro's. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

          <td><font size="2">Pedro O'Hara's is on Maine Street and features an 
            eclectic mix of Mexican and Irish food and beverages. (Henry Coppola, 
            <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The Foodies descended stairs to the basement space to see 
        a large bar and such colorful cultural artifacts as Irish and Mexican 
        flags, a metal sculpture of the sun (presumably from Mexico), and antique 
        advertisements and posters. They were surrounded by the passion of sunset 
        hues dripping on walls, tables and chairs. Pedro's alter-ego, a leaping, 
        beer-guzzling leprechaun wearing a Mexican sombrero, beckoned the patrons 
        further into his cozy tavern. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The place was bustling, so Foodies and friends waited for 
        about ten minutes at small tables by the bar. They regaled one another 
        with the printed tale of Pedro's father, an Irish chef fleeing the potato 
        famine, who found peace amidst the Mexican hills and a culinary minded 
        senorita. After requests, waiters promptly brought drinks and bowls of 
        crispy tortilla chips, spicy yet canned salsa, and creamy guacamole to 
        soothe growling stomachs. Kerry realized that Pedro's is not quite an 
        authentic establishment when her waitress referred to the guacamole as 
        &quot;guac.&quot; Fearing that a mass-produced factory vat might belong 
        to Senor O'Hara, the foodie was pleased to find the condiment made from 
        legitimate avacodos. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The waitress then seated the Foodie party at a small, high 
        table with equally small, high chairs that were difficult to maneuver. 
        But Foodies and friends can sacrifice comfort for style, right? Admittedly, 
        this place tries hard to be hip, but its efforts can sometimes fall flat. 
        A Foodie friend's attempt to leave the table became a whole-party event; 
        everyone had to scoot her chair further into the table, thereby knocking 
        knees with others, or had to climb off her chair altogether in order to 
        get out of the way. Bathroom visits became manipulative games amongst 
        the hungry diners. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Foodies and friends chose from three different menus: &quot;Pedro's 
        Mexi-Fare,&quot; (Mexican/Tex-Mex offerings), &quot;O'Hara's Grille&quot; 
        (hamburgers and sandwiches) and &quot;Hearty Pub Fare&quot; (stir-fry, 
        steak or lamb dinners with sides). Corned beef and cabbage enticed diners 
        in search of the fair isle, but this establishment is not so much Mexican/Irish 
        as Mexican/Alcoholic. The Celtic influence mostly comes across in terms 
        of beer and liquor options. </p>
      <p align="left">Apparently Mexico shares this love of drink; the foodies 
        lustfully eyed frozen margaritas in the restaurant's trademark colors. 
        Alas, as young innocents, the foodies could not sample the alcoholic beverages; 
        however, trust them on this point: Pedro can take care of you. After a 
        long while, Kerry's Tequila-Lime Chicken arrived hot and accompanied by 
        beans and Pedro's &quot;famous green rice,&quot; which is basically white 
        rice with a lot of herbs. </p>
      <p align="left">The chicken was moist, tender and cooked- through, but conveyed 
        no tequila or lime flavor. Shame, shame on false advertising. Foodie two 
        became jealous of Kerry, for despite the missing tequila shot, the plate 
        looked tempting. The fajita wrap proved a poor choice; the tortilla expanded 
        beyond ceramic confines, matched the lukewarm temperature of the non- 
        mesquite grilled chicken, and held too many canned jalapenos. In addition, 
        its largesse could not mollify the dominant bland flavor. Eying her friends 
        choices, she absconded with large portions of her roommate's burrito. 
        Really, this neat little Mexican package shined as brightly as Pedro's 
        sun sculpture. The cheese oozed nicely over a crisp tortilla and had a 
        sharp tone which was well-balanced with freshly prepared chicken. When 
        considering dishes from O'Hara's Mexican homeland, please order only this 
        entr&eacute;e. Enchiladas and their bland corn tortillas did not marry 
        as well as Pedro's Mexican momma and Irish poppa. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And what are the dessert options? Oooh, perhaps a silky 
        Mexican flan, coconut crusted fried ice cream with caramel (cajeta), honey 
        -drenched sopapillas, some Irish bread pudding or fruit sorbet? Silly 
        Foodies! They should have been pleased that this new establishment could 
        offer any dessert at all (Not! Psych!). A cold, hard slice of raspberry 
        tart, clearly enamored of Mr. Smuckers, arrived with a melting dollop 
        of Reddy-Whip and a mint sprig. And no ice cream, either, despite firm 
        requests. What a pity-Pedro's imagination failed in this respect. Here 
        the restaurant's gimmick becomes apparent and strips Pedro of his bi- 
        continental gastronomical heritage. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite its loose interpretations, slow service, and penchant 
        for pre-packaged goods, Pedro O'Hara's shows promise; it's a fun place 
        to eat with friends because of its decor, low prices, satisfying portions, 
        and friendly, young waitstaff. If you're desperate for something that 
        echoes Mexican food, and you're scared of Rosita's, you should stop by 
        for some decent renditions. </p>
