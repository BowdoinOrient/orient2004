      <p align="left"> The Bowdoin Softball Team burst onto the sunny competitive 
        scene in Florida during its Spring Break trip after a long pre-season 
        at Farley Field House. After facing many teams from around the country, 
        including NESCAC rival Amherst, the Bears posted a winning record of 8-5. 
        Despite an inspired effort by the team, Bowdoin did suffer a heartbreaking 
        loss at the hands of the Lord Jeff's in a 6-5 barn burner. All in all, 
        it was not a completely wasted trip as most of the Polar Bears returned 
        with healthy sock tans and bikini lines.<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">Upon its return, Bowdoin swept the in-state competition 
        of the University of New England, the University of Southern Maine, and 
        the University of Maine at Farmington. Against UNE, senior captain Gina 
        Laugelli posted her fourth win from the mound, while maintaining a high 
        level of concentration during the highly dramatic final innings of the 
        match, which ended with a score of 5-4.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">USM met its match with the Bears, losing 4-2, thanks in 
        large part to a series of three singles by the slightly disabled, but 
        ever speedy Katie Sheridan, drag queen Michelle Jackson, and offensive 
        dynamo Liz Swedock which gave Bowdoin a 2-0 lead in the first. Erin Hanley 
        completed the entire game only allowing two runs on six hits.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The much anticipated first home run of the season for the 
        Polar Bears came at the paws of first base senior captain Kristie Miller 
        over the right field fence in the first inning against UMF. Many attribute 
        Miller's success to her off-season dedication in the weight room. Few 
        were surprised by her recently awarded All-American status granted by 
        the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Once again, she has 
        proved that it's always Miller Time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The two-run blast started off the 8-1 rout of the Beavers. 
        Hanley again went the distance for Bowdoin, striking out seven. Jessie 
        Poulin handed UMF their second loss of the afternoon. Senior captains 
        Emily Rizza and Miller combined contributed to the win for 4-5 from the 
        plate and posted 2 RBIS and two runs scored in the win.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears five game winning streak was ended by the Jumbos 
        from Tufts. The first game was a true pitchers' duel, as the score was 
        locked at zero going into the sixth inning. Poulin and catcher Sheridan 
        combined to keep the game tight. However, a Jumbo broke the tie with a 
        two-run homer, earning the only runs of the game. In the second game, 
        the Jumbos burst out of the gates early, leaving the Bears behind in a 
        flurry of hits. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rebounding quickly, Bowdoin swept Plymouth State College 
        on Monday. Poulin struck out seven and Rachael &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon 
        drove in the final RBI, winning the game for the Bears with a score of 
        2-1. Gordon is one of the fastest Bears on the team and her teammates 
        anticipate future exploits similar to those of Miller within the weight 
        room. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an amazing display of pitching prowess, Hanley completed 
        only the third no-hitter in Bowdoin softball history in the second game. 
        Laugelli accomplished the same feat last year against Husson. Jordan Alper 
        headed up the offensive effort going 2-3 with an RBI and two runs scored. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears will be facing Husson this afternoon at home in 
        a double-header. The games promise to be both exciting and entertaining, 
        starring Mrs. Burton as the head of the Friends of Bowdoin Softball Cheering 
        Squad. Be sure to head out to the field to catch some rays and some of 
        the action. Bowdoin softball is the perfect way to finish off your week.
