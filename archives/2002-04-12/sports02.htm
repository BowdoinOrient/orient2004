      <p align="left"><font size="5">New hope for Boston fans<br>
        <font size="2">GIL BARNDOLLAR</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER </font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> There was a time, just a few years ago, when the Boston 
        pro sports scene was a virtual wasteland. It may seem like a distant memory 
        now, with the Pats bringing its Super Bowl victory tour to Portland two 
        days ago, the NHL and NBA playoffs approaching, and the Red Sox season 
        just starting up. But, for the last few years, it was a pretty dismal 
        time to be a Boston sports fan<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Patriots, of course, surprised almost everyone this 
        year in going from worst in their division in 2001 to Super Bowl Champions 
        in 2002. Almost everyone picked them to be the worst team in the AFC East 
        once again. Instead, after starting 0-2 and losing franchise quarterback 
        Drew Bledsoe for most of the season, the Patriots rallied and won 11 of 
        their remaining 14 games. Driven by Bill Belichick's unpredictable defense 
        and the solid play of backup quarterback Tom Brady, the Patriots won their 
        division, tore through the playoffs, and shocked the world by upsetting 
        the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI. It was a far cry from the Pete Carroll Era 
        of poor drafts, off-field incidents, and underachieving teams.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bruins, meanwhile, have had almost as great a turnaround 
        as the Patriots so far this year. After finishing second-to-last in their 
        division and missing the playoffs last season, the Bruins are poised to 
        win the Eastern Conference behind a great young team. This after a five-year 
        stretch in which they missed the playoffs three times, while the closest 
        their fans got to the Stanley Cup was watching vicariously as Ray Bourque 
        hoisted it for the Colorado Avalanche in 2000. Now the Bruins have a border-line 
        MVP candidate in Joe Thornton, a top-flight goalie in Byron Dafoe, and 
        a collection of great forwards. Even the trades of Anson Carter and Jason 
        Allison, dismissed as cheapskate behavior typical of the organization, 
        worked out for the best, netting the Bruins two of their best players, 
        Bill Guerin and Glen Murray. For the first time in maybe a decade, the 
        Bruins have a legitimate shot at the Stanley Cup.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For Celtics fans, the resignation of head coach Rick Pitino 
        last year should have been reason enough to celebrate. After taking over 
        for M.L. Carr following the team's franchise-worst 15-67 finish in 1997, 
        Pitino only ran the Celtics further into the ground. While the Celtics 
        managed to get All-Stars Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce, mostly through 
        sheer luck, &quot;Trader Rick&quot; got rid of any semblance of a supporting 
        cast. Danny Fortson, Ron Mercer, and Chauncey Billups, all good players, 
        were traded away for duds like Vitaly Potapenko, Kenny Anderson, and Tony 
        Battie. The Celtics never played .500 basketball in Pitino's tenure, even 
        in an Eastern Conference devoid of any great teams.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since assistant Jim O'Brien took over as head coach last 
        season, the Celtics seem simultaneously more relaxed and more intense. 
        Great defense, a concept Pitino preached but never saw in Boston, is now 
        one of their hallmarks. Driven by the shooting of Pierce and Walker, the 
        Celtics have already clinched their first playoff berth since the 1994-1995 
        season. While it's difficult to see the Celtics going deep into the postseason, 
        there will be playoff basketball in Boston for the first time since the 
        immortal Dino Radja was roaming the Garden floor.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lastly, we come to the Red Sox. A playoff team in 1998 and 
        1999, the Sox don't exactly conform to my theory about the recent awful 
        state of Boston sports. But even here, the last year has brought only 
        improvements. Dan Duquette was fired, ending a tenure more remarkable 
        for its incredible lack of humanity than any achievements on the field. 
        Duquette fired coaches and cut players without a thought, and didn't seem 
        to mind when Carl Everett grabbed his crotch and spit at an opposing pitcher 
        on Family Day at Fenway. In trying to improve the roster, Duquette stripmined 
        the Sox farm system and traded away most of the team's viable prospects. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So as spring begins, Boston sports fans have much to look 
        forward to. Though in this era of free agency and salary caps, professional 
        teams can experience dramatic changes in their fortunes in just a season 
        or two, there is no denying that in the last year three of Boston's four 
        major teams have experienced dramatic resurrections.</p>
