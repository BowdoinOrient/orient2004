      <p align="left"> This weekend, Film Society has the pleasure of presenting 
        three quality musicals. Since this is a dry weekend on campus, we're hoping 
        you'll use the lack of campus wide parties as an excuse to come out and 
        catch a few of these films. These movies are kind of like a campus wide 
        party&#133;there's lots of music, and people get dressed up in them and 
        do weird things. The only things they're missing are long lines and smelly 
        basements. Oh yeah, and alcohol, but this is a dry weekend, so you're 
        going to have to do without no matter what. As always, the movies will 
        be shown in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall, and are free and open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Dancer in the Dark<br>
        Friday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        Remember at the Oscars a couple years back when Bj&ouml;rk wore that swan 
        dress? Well, it was because of her nomination for this film that she was 
        able to attend the ceremony. Although the nomination was for best song, 
        Bj&ouml;rk also stars in this film, where she plays a European immigrant 
        to the U.S. who is slowly going blind. Her son has inherited this disease, 
        and she is trying to save enough money to get him a preventative operation. 
        Life is bleak in this film, and Bj&ouml;rk is able to get away from her 
        troubles through her love of music, specifically Hollywood musicals. Hence, 
        we get a bleak drama that features musical numbers. How much fun is that?</p>
      <p>Velvet Goldmine<br>
        Friday at 9:00 p.m.<br>
        This film centers on the world of Glam rockers. It is 1984, and a reporter 
        is sent out into the world to find a musician he was once huge fan of 
        whose career has disappeared since the end of the 1970s. The story he 
        discovers is basically about a fantasy world in which a man based upon 
        David Bowie had a romantic relationship with a man based upon Iggy Pop. 
        Not a very common plot for sure, but this isn't a film concerned about 
        plot. Glam Rock was about the show. You had to be as wild and fantastic 
        as possible, and this movie does just that.</p>
      <p>Moulin Rouge<br>
        Saturday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        This is a film in which the biggest star is the film itself. When you 
        see this film, you are taken on a visual roller coaster that doesn't let 
        up for a second. Although it is hinged upon a tragic romance, this film 
        is a lot of fun. The use of song and dance is incredible-it uses familiar 
        pop tunes in an entirely new way. The sets are equally incredible. That 
        is why it recently won the Oscar for best Art Direction and Set Design, 
        and deservedly so. This really is a remarkable film that I strongly encourage 
        you to attend. Where else are you going to see John Leguizamo play a hallucinogenic 
        addicted midget? [Note to my Art Historian friends: I know Toulouse Lautrec 
        wasn't a real midget, but when people think that there are midgets in 
        a movie, they come out to see it]</p>
