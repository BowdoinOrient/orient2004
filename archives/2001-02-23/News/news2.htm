      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nationally syndicated conservative columnist George 
        Will pushed quite a few buttons last week when he spoke at Common Hour 
        about the role of public policy in a post-Clinton era. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will began his talk by suggesting that the past presidential 
        election had been decided by sociological divisions and not economics. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asserted that political power is moving away from 
        the large eastern cities and into the south and west, and that this shift 
        should be eagerly anticipated by Republicans.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will criticized conservative lawmakers for not carrying 
        through with public policy reforms when given the opportunity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public television, he said, is archaic in a time of 
        500-channel satellite TV, but Republican lawmakers who promised to end 
        it in 1994 have not yet done so. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also criticized Democrats. At one point, Will painted 
        the GOP as the pro-choice party, arguing that Democrats restrict choices 
        about smoking, wearing fur, hunting, and making political contributions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question-and-answer session after Will's talk revealed 
        that many Bowdoin students hadn't liked what they'd heard. One student 
        pointedly chided Will for not providing sources for statistics in his 
        talk and asked where he was getting them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He responded, "I read." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another criticized Will for being insensitive to concerns 
        of voter fraud in the past election and said that working families had 
        been denied the right to vote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do your parents work?" Will asked. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer was affirmative. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Did they vote?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, then.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was much applause. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question came from a student who identified 
        himself as "probably the only Marxist in the audience who enjoyed your 
        talk."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week's Common Hour lecturer will be Frederick Wiseman, 
        a documentary filmmaker, who will speak in Kresge Auditorium. </p>
