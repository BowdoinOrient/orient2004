      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some record-breaking capped a great finish for the 
        men's hockey team last weekend. Senior captain Colin Robinson and first-year 
        Chris Pelletier added their names to the history books in home-rink defeats 
        of Babson and Umass-Boston. The Bears have completed the regular season 
        with a 13-9-1 overall record (11-6-0 NESCAC). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Coach Terry Meagher said that, in defeating a nationally 
        competitive team, the 4-2 Babson win came at a good time for the Bears. 
        "The Friday night game was very enjoyable for our athletes," he said. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babson struck first, but wouldn't hold a lead for long. 
        Corey Zahn picked up a deflection after a breakaway and beat Robinson 
        for a 1-0 margin. Mike Carosi '02 answered back 56 ticks into the second 
        period, assisted by Dave Rush '02 and Chad Hart '03. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After one additional Babson goal, it was all Bowdoin 
        from there. Sophomore Sean Starke took a dish from Carosi and Captain 
        Alex Tatum '01 for the 2-2 tie. Albert Mayer '03 and Brian Shuman '02 
        set up Carosi for his second goal of the night, and sophomore Adam Mantin's 
        empty-net goal would secure the game at 4-2. Robinson made 25 saves in 
        the game that brought him to a tie with Steve Janas, Class of '89, for 
        career victories in net. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day brought UMass-Boston to Dayton, and the 
        Beacons would go home unhappy that night. Coach Meagher said that the 
        lopsided 10-1 score reflected dominant offensive play from his team. "It 
        was one of those games where we carried over a good performance from the 
        day before," he said. "We were very balanced in our play." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three minutes into the matchup, Mayer put away the first 
        Polar Bear goal. He was followed by senior John Glynn, who converted a 
        feed from Jared Porter '03 for a 2-0 lead. Mike Stevens '04 netted a goal 
        in the second period off assists from Andy McNerney '02 and Glynn. Then 
        it came time for some record-breaking. Pelletier's two second-period goals 
        pushed his season total to 16, and made him the school's all-time leader 
        for goals scored by a first-year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He topped Ron Marcellus's 15 goals in the '78-'79 season. 
        "It was a significant, long-standing record," Coach Meagher said. "These 
        records are not easy to break, and that's certainly a credit to him. We're 
        very proud of him."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beacons managed one goal at the end of the second 
        period, but were buried under third period goals from Porter, Stevens, 
        Mantin, Marty Brisebois '04, and Bill Busch '02. The Bears tallied a giant 
        62-10 shot advantage in the matchup. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The UMass victory was Colin Robinson's 49th career win, 
        breaking Janas's '85-'89 record. The accolades continued when he was named 
        NESCAC's Player of the Week for his efforts. "We've been blessed with 
        wonderful goaltending at the College," Meager stated. "It really talks 
        about Colin's athletic ability and staying power." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth-seeded Bears enter this weekend's quarterfinals, 
        with top-seeded Middlebury earning home advantage for the semifinal and 
        championship games. It will be Bowdoin's 25th appearance in post-season 
        play in the last 26 years. "It means a great deal to us," said Coach Meagher. 
        "One of our goals in this program is always to contend for tournament 
        play." </p>
