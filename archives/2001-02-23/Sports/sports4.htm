      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's basketball team's season came to a disappointing 
        conclusion with two painful home losses this past weekend. The Polar Bears-needing 
        to win at least one of the games to qualify for the NESCAC tournament-fell 
        to Amherst (17-5) and Trinity (17-5) by accounts of 69-65 and 70-64, respectively.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Friday night, Bowdoin entertained a formidable Amherst 
        squad before a boisterous student crowd. The Polar Bears did not disappoint 
        in the early goings. Bolstered by the hot shooting of senior Steve McKinnon, 
        Bowdoin mounted a seemingly insurmountable 17-point lead with just 1:46 
        left in the first half. However, the stately Lord Jeffs responded with 
        a 6-0 run of their own to close within 11 by the half's end.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amherst's late first-half success carried over to the 
        start of the game's second stanza, as they began to knock down jump shots 
        with startling proficiency. Just seven minutes into the half, the Polar 
        Bears suddenly found themselves trailing 53-47. Though Bowdoin would chip 
        away at the Lord Jeff lead the remainder of the way, the red hot shooting 
        of Amherst senior Erik Kelly-aptly dubbed "Bird-Face" by one surly Bowdoin 
        spectator-carried the visitors to victory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greg Orlicz '02 and senior Dave Baranowski were outstanding 
        in defeat for the Polar Bears. Orlicz slashed to the basket with relative 
        ease throughout the game, finishing with 16 points in just 19 minutes 
        of action. Baranowski had one of his better all-around games in a Polar 
        Bear uniform, recording 15 points, 8 boards, seven assists, and 6 blocked 
        shots. Junior Chris Ranslow contributed 10 rebounds, while McKinnon was 
        excellent throughout, pacing the team with 17 points.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an emotional Saturday afternoon, Bowdoin again squandered 
        a sizable lead before falling to a very strong NESCAC opponent. Before 
        the Senior-Day game, Dave Baranowski, Steve McKinnon, Erich Buschmann, 
        and Greg Lovely were honored at half-court. All four seniors remained 
        on the floor to start the contest, and each helped stake Bowdoin to 20-7 
        lead eight minutes into the first half.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bantams-who, at 6-3 in conference play, have earned 
        the No. 1 seed in the NESCAC tournament-were able to cut into the Bowdoin 
        lead with a series of runs, eventually pulling ahead 64-61 with just 37 
        seconds remaining. </p>
