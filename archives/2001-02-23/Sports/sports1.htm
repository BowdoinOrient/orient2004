      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regular season drew to a close on Tuesday night 
        for the Bowdoin College women's hockey team. The Bears weren't victorious 
        that night falling 4-2 to Division-I Boston College. Keeping in mind that 
        BC is a D-I team the Bears made a strong showing in the game. Before traveling 
        to Boston on Tuesday, Bowdoin ran its winning streak against D-III opponents 
        to five games with lopsided victories over both Trinity and Amherst. The 
        women finish the season with a 16-4-3 record overall, 16-3-3 in D-III 
        play and a 12-3-3 mark in the ECAC. The Bears must now turn their attention 
        to the playoffs and tough rematches with some of the nation's top teams, 
        among which Bowdoin must be counted.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recapping the weekend's games, the Bears knocked off 
        Trinity 10-1 on Saturday afternoon. First year Gillian McDonald led the 
        way with her second hat trick of the season. Seven other players would 
        light the lamp for Bowdoin as they scored seven times in the first frame 
        before finishing off the Bantams with three more goals in the third period. 
        Sophomores Shelly Chessie and Beth Muir added a goal and two assists apiece. 
        All told the Bears would fire off 51 shots on the afternoon, while the 
        Bowdoin goalie, senior Katie Worthing, would have to make only four saves 
        on the afternoon to take the victory, her second of the season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday afternoon the Bears continued to hand out 
        punishment as they took down Amherst 7-0. The Bears were scoring was capped 
        once again by a hat trick. This time it was first year Lindsey Simon who 
        picked up her first career three-goal game. After a scoreless first period 
        Simon netted two of her goals in the second as part of a five-goal outburst 
        from the Bears. Chessie chipped in two scores on the afternoon and handed 
        out another assist. Her first goal came as part of the second period scoring 
        flurry; she would later put the finishing touches on the game with the 
        Bears' seventh goal. Before Chessie finished off the scoring Simon finished 
        up her hat trick, picking up her third goal on a short handed shift to 
        open the third frame. Sophomore Francesca Klucevek-Whalen would pick up 
        the win with 10 stops in the first two periods before giving way to classmate 
        Emily McKissok in the third. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in Boston on Tuesday the Bears played well but 
        couldn't knock off the D-I Eagles. Chessie had the first Bowdoin goal 
        off an assist from Ba Lanoue '03, that score made it 1-1 in the second. 
        The Eagles would soon pull away with two quick scores in the last ten 
        minutes of the second period. After falling behind 4-1, Jen Pelkey would 
        round out the scoring in the third as she netted the Bears' second goal. 
        McKissok stopped all 16 shots she faced in the first period but couldn't 
        hold BC off in the end; she had 33 saves all told in the loss.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning our attention back to the playoffs the Bears 
        have the sixth seed in the ECAC tournament and will head to number three 
        seed Williams this weekend. The meeting between the two nationally ranked 
        teams, Bowdoin is #5, Williams #2, will be a rematch of Williams' 5-2 
        victory in Williamstown earlier this season. Although Bowdoin holds the 
        edge in the overall series 10-3-2, the Ephs have taken the last three 
        matches including one in last years ECAC playoffs. The Bears are looking 
        forward to the rematch; "Williams is a very good team, but I know we can 
        play a lot better than we did in our first meeting," said Bowdoin Head 
        Coach Michele Amidon. "Our team is looking forward to the challenge of 
        playing in the ECAC tournament and I expect Saturday to be a great game."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check back next week for the results of the playoff 
        match-up. As always, Go U Bears! </p>
