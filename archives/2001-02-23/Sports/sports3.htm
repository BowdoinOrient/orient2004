      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming off the emotional high of their Maine State 
        Meet victory the previous Saturday, the Bowdoin Men's Indoor Track team 
        faltered slightly at the New England DIII Indoor Track Championship held 
        at Tufts University. Although the team finished a respectable seventh 
        out of 25 teams, the Bowdoin men failed to match last year's second place 
        finish.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a cacophony of coughs and sneezes echoing throughout 
        the Bowdoin campus this past week, no one was to be spared. Unfortunately, 
        several key point scorers for the men's team had to withdraw from the 
        meet due to their weakened states. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One runner, who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity, 
        blacked out while in the bathroom on the morning of the meet. All he remembers 
        is waking up with his face pressed against the cold, tile floor.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We had a better meet in the State Meet than we did 
        in the New England Championship. We had a few key people who were sick, 
        and it made a big difference," said Coach Peter Slovenski.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the Bowdoin men still came through with some impressive 
        efforts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeff Manganaro '03, who has been virtually unstoppable 
        in the 55m dash this season, finished fifth. Phil Webster '04 grabbed 
        fourth place in the 600m, while Captain and Cross-Country All American 
        Steve Allison '01 placed third in the 1500m, with an NCAA provisional 
        qualifying time of 3:56. Pat Vardaro '03, perhaps the best Bowdoin distance 
        runner this season, ran a courageous race and finished third in the 3000m 
        in a time of 8:39. James Wilkins '04 finished third in the high jump, 
        while the 4x400m relay team sprinted to a fifth place finish.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We'll continue to work hard and we will prove ourselves 
        to be a better team than we showed on Saturday. On a positive note, a 
        number of athletes gained experience at a championship meet. This is important 
        because we have a young team," said Allison.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Saturday, Wilkins, Allison, Manganaro, the 4x400m 
        and the 4x800m relay teams will travel to Boston University to compete 
        at the Open New England Championship, which will feature some of the best 
        Division I and III athletes in New England. I'm sure they'll hold their 
        own against those Ivy League hooligans. </p>
