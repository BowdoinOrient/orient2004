      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Tuesday, the Bowdoin women's basketball team 
        defeated Middlebury 58 to 47 in a quarterfinal match-up of the NESCAC 
        tournament. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top scorers for the Polar Bears were Lora Trenkle '04 
        with fourteen points, Kristi Royer '03 with thirteen points, and Jessie 
        Mayol '02 with thirteen points. Courtney Trotta '04 added five points 
        while Nicole Fava '03, Jamie Bennett '01, and Lauren Myers '01 each contributed 
        four points. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royer also chipped in nine rebounds to help the Bowdoin 
        effort. Bowdoin dominated the game from the beginning, holding the Panthers 
        to just eighteen points in the first half. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middlebury made a strong run in the second half, but 
        the Polar Bears were simply too much. With this victory, Bowdoin advances 
        to the semifinal round of the NESCAC tournament; they will take on Colby 
        this Friday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past weekend, before tournament-time, Bowdoin took 
        on Amherst and Trinity. Losing to Amherst 44 to 50 and defeating Trinity 
        75 to 66, the team was able to get in some last preparation for the post-season. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royer and Mayol had exceptional performances in each 
        of these games, as they led the team's scoring effort. Coming off a slow 
        start at Amherst, Trenkle bounced back to score twenty points against 
        Trinity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these last regular-season games behind them, the 
        Polar Bears are ready to test their skills against more challenging competition. 
        Junior captain Mayol is excited about the team's prospects for this week's 
        match-up against Colby as well as for the rest of the post-season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayol remarked: "We've accomplished one of our goals 
        this season (finishing in the top 7 in NESCAC) and now we're working on 
        the second major goal-to win the NESCAC tournament!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such outstanding efforts as those during this past 
        week, the Polar Bears seem to be in good form to take on their Colby rivals 
        this Friday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We've split with Colby so far this season," Mayol commented, 
        "and this is our chance to prove that we have what it takes-enough drive 
        and stamina to win a tough battle." </p>
