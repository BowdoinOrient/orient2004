      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a four-day vacation in Middletown, Connecticut, 
        and the lame excuse of computer problems, I am coming out of a temporary 
        pseudo-retirement with yet another edition of the scintillating update 
        on the Bowdoin Swim Team. The men's team will wrap up their season this 
        weekend with the NESCAC conference championships, to be held at Bowdoin's 
        own Leroy A. Greason Pool. The sessions start at 10 a.m. on Friday, Saturday, 
        and Sunday mornings, finals at 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, and 
        5:30 p.m. on Sunday. And since I featured the seniors on the women's team 
        last time, I thought it only appropriate to lead into the men's championship 
        meet with a feature on the two seniors on the men's team.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan Farnbach '01 and Henry Bangert '01 both have interesting 
        perspectives on their swimming careers at Bowdoin and the '00-'01 swim 
        season because neither one of them was on the team last year. Juniors 
        Elliot Dickson and Andy Shaw were elected captains a year early because 
        there were no rising seniors to nominate. Dan returned to Bowdoin this 
        fall after a year away from campus, while Henry decided to come out of 
        a four-year retirement to pick up the sport one last time for his senior 
        year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've been swimming for a long time," says Farnbach, 
        "thirteen years to be exact, most of them on year-round programs." He 
        says he swam in some high-level meets during his career, even "winning 
        some medals." Dan describes his choice to join the Bowdoin swim program 
        as one that was made by severe coersion: "Swimming was not the number 
        one priority when I decided on schools. But I had the choice to either 
        be a scrub on the Princeton team or the top breaststroker on the Bowdoin 
        team. I came for a visit that ended up lasting a full week. I think I 
        pushed the team's limits of hospitality and Josh Wernig, who is a large 
        man, told me that if I did not come to Bowoin, he would hunt me down."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the choice was clear to Dan from the moment he was 
        exposed to the Bowdoin program. He comments positively on the transition 
        of the coaching staff at Bowdoin: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I returned to Bowdoin after a year away...and I was 
        not sure if I would want to be on the team...[the coaches] Brad and Mark 
        really won me over. To think that after 13 years you can re-learn a sport 
        entirely - not just a few skills, but everything - that's something I 
        will keep with me in the future." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a shoulder injury, Dan continues to contribute 
        significantly to Bowdoin's program. Reflecting on his three years with 
        the team, Dan concludes, "Bowdoin's team is up there with the best of 
        them in my mind, even though I don't always show it. For the upcoming 
        classes, I have to quote the dying man from the movie, <i>Magnolia</i>: 
        'all that bullshit is true, you know.'" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry Bangert brings a very different experience to 
        the Bowdoin team. The St. Louis, Missouri, native claims his mother encouraged 
        him to take up swimming because "the [Missouri] lakes and rivers are less 
        than clear, in fact, they are 90 percent mud. My mother...realized that 
        if I were to fall into one of these bodies of water, she would be unable 
        to see me...so I began swimming." By the age of six, Henry was on a team 
        at the YMCA, turning to year-round programs by the age of eight. However, 
        with a sport such as swimming comes the inevitable burnout period, as 
        he claims his high school career to reflect. "After a four-year stint 
        of retirement I returned to be humbled by the amazing Bowdoin men and 
        women."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the decision to swim the last year of college? "The 
        attitude of the team has changed," states Henry. "People want to get fast. 
        It is not the drinking club that it was when I was a freshman." I asked 
        Henry what he thought of the transition of the coaching staff at Bowdoin, 
        and he replied, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I can't really say much about the coaching transition 
        because I never swam for Charlie [Butt]. I can, however, comment on the 
        effect this season has had on me. Take every opportunity to humble yourself 
        by joining an athletic team that you are totally unprepared for. It pays 
        off in the end." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any favorite memories of the season? "Swimming at night 
        down in Florida, when it was 50 degrees and the wind was whipping across 
        the pool. It was awesome." Henry looks forward to this weekend, when those 
        50 degree training trip nights will pay off."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's team will lose two valuable assets with the 
        graduation of Dan and Henry. The NESCAC Championships this weekend will 
        end not only the season, but their career. </p>
