      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Otis Howard had the confidence of Secretary 
        of War Edwin Stanton, of General-in-Chief Ulysses S. Grant, of the numerous 
        Christian aid organizations in the North, and of the Congress of the United 
        States. He had assembled a group of some of the most experienced and most 
        liberal-minded officers in the Union to help him in the task of ensuring 
        that the path to freedom for the freedmen was truly free. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all respects as Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, 
        Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, he had both the authority of Congress and 
        the power of the United States Army to back his plans for reconstruction. 
        But Howard lacked two powerful allies, one was the president, Andrew Johnson, 
        and the second was the consent of the Southern states, which vowed that 
        the freedmen would never be free as long as they still breathed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that the Bureau's task was to help get the freedmen 
        on their feet and then leave before the former slaves became too dependent 
        on the organization's aid, Howard invested his time mostly in long term 
        plans. Maintaining that "education is generally the best possible investment 
        that can be made in a free government," Howard called in help from Northern 
        aid societies and churches, in an attempt to set up schools and universities 
        throughout the South. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While these institutions did not discriminate against 
        whites, there was a subconscious understanding that these were in essence 
        freedmen's schools and decent whites would not be attending them. Thus 
        while the education program got off the ground, it brought up the issue 
        of segregated schools, which would take almost a hundred years to resolve. 
        Perhaps Howard's greatest success in the field of freedmen's education 
        was the founding of Howard University in Washington D.C in 1867. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the help of the First Congregational Church, of 
        which Howard was a member, the Bureau invested a great amount of funds 
        in purchasing land (which was hard to come by since no one wanted to sell 
        land to freemen) and outlining the plans for the university. In time Howard 
        University- as it came to be known, despite the Commissioner's modest 
        claims and protests-slowly grew to offer degrees in law, agriculture, 
        and medicine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other fields also opened up, as funds became available. 
        An interesting fact about the University is that it discriminated neither 
        against race nor gender showing that it was one of the more liberal universities 
        in the country at the time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the University had the backing of the Freedmen's 
        Bureau, it still fought an uphill fight to stay open. Howard tirelessly 
        labored to raise money from organizations throughout the north sympathetic 
        to the education of freedmen. Buildings still had to be built and many 
        of the students came without the financial ability to pay for their tuition. 
        Howard settled on an agreement with the inventor of the American Building 
        Block-a new kind of brick which was cheap and sturdier than the bricks 
        of the day-to have the bricks manufactured on the University's campus. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students working as construction workers helped to put 
        the University together, thus paying for their tuition. This program worked 
        fine for a while but in December of 1868 part of one of the buildings 
        collapsed. This led to a major investigation of the buildings and of the 
        bricks themselves. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University would continue to struggle to exist for 
        years. In 1869, Howard was offered the presidency of the University. Howard 
        accepted and moved the headquarters of the Freedmen's Bureau from downtown 
        Washington to one of the University's buildings, bringing in revenue for 
        rent. His double role as Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau and President 
        of Howard University seems not to have slowed down his efforts for either 
        organization although by this time Howard had many other issues to deal 
        with as well. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While President of Howard University (he stayed its 
        president for five years) Howard kept the educational facilities at their 
        prime, refused to lower the high standards of the university, and helped 
        students find jobs so that they could pay for tuition. Howard, being the 
        military man that he was, brought military training to the campus (much 
        like what Joshua Chamberlain was doing to Bowdoin at approximately the 
        same time) and trained the students in the discipline of West Point. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While education was a key issue for the Bureau, there 
        were other areas, which the Commissioner was told were much more important 
        to the success of the freedmen. Perhaps the most important was the issue 
        of land. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Congress founded the Bureau, it gave the Commissioner 
        the power to give plots of land of up to forty acres to freedmen. Howard 
        had witnessed this process in action in the Sea Islands where plots of 
        land from former plantations were given to the freed men who cultivated 
        them and had a considerable amount of success. This program had been maintained 
        by Rufus Saxton, Howard's Assistant Commissioner for the Carolinas. However, 
        as the Bureau prepared to give out land to the freedmen, Andrew Johnson 
        stepped in to halt the program. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson's plan for Reconstruction called for the quick 
        restoration of all the States back into the Union. This plan led him to 
        pardon a great many former Confederates and order the restoration of their 
        lands. This posed a threat to the Bureau since a great deal of its income 
        would come from these confiscated lands. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard had already started the process of giving forty 
        acres of land to freedmen, telling them that they would be able to buy 
        the land from the government within three years. And now suddenly Johnson 
        revoked Howard's order, telling him that the freedmen would have to go 
        and the lands would have to go back to the former owners. By order of 
        the President, Howard was sent on a tour of the South in the fall of 1865 
        to spread the bad news to the freedmen that their dreams of owning land 
        were now up in smoke. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Sea Islands Howard found a large crowd of freedmen 
        waiting for him. Along with the Assistant Commissioner for the area, Rufus 
        Saxton, the freedmen demanded that they be allowed to remain. They had 
        been there for five years. They had taken over the lands when their owners 
        had retreated inland, away from the Federal Navy in 1861, and they had 
        made homes out of these lands. To take the land away from them would be 
        criminal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard was sympathetic to their plight and vowed that 
        he would do what he could to make sure that their lands were permanently 
        theirs. Howard reasoned that if Johnson wanted to ignore the rights of 
        the freedmen, Congress surely wouldn't.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fight that Howard was gearing up for was the 
        one of equal rights. Freedmen were not allowed to testify against whites 
        in courts of law all over the country, including some of the Northern 
        states, which had supported the abolition of slavery. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This and the fact that violence against freedmen was 
        increasing considerably in the Southern states-freedmen were being murdered, 
        their churches and schools were being burnt and in 1866 two massive riots 
        in Memphis and New Orleans would demonstrate to the world that the Southern 
        hatred for freedmen had not subsided with the end of the War-made Howard 
        aware that if there was to be peace in the former Confederacy after the 
        Bureau was dismantled, then the freedmen needed both the protection of 
        the courts and the right to vote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus with Congress assembling for its thirty-ninth session, 
        Howard prepared to wage war for the rights of freedmen against the office 
        of Andrew Johnson. It was a battle he was destined to fail.<br>
