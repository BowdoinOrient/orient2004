      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While out in Los Angeles, Mrs. Applegate saw many old 
        friends: First, as mentioned last week, her plastic surgeon "old Earl" 
        Dr. Boehme; second, almost daily, Bea Hudson, the owner of the restaurant 
        downstairs, on premises rented from her friend of many years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A motherly type, rotund and jolly, Mrs. Hudson took 
        a great shine to me, maybe because she thought, it later occurred to me, 
        that Nellie might end up adopting me. Originally from Chicago and widowed, 
        Bea had two sons, Matt and John, who both worked for her.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt, then a chef, was a former Marine, crew-cut and 
        with scars on his face from wounds received in the Korean War. He'd married 
        Vivian, the widow of an elder brother killed in Korea. Even in his chef's 
        outfit he still looked a pretty tough character. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivian acted as hostess. A petite southern belle with 
        a lilting voice and an ingratiating manner, she was perfect for the part. 
        Naturally, I developed an instant crush on her, a situation she handled 
        beautifully, neither encouraging nor discouraging me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger brother John, acting as host alongside her, 
        was a different type from Matt altogether. I liked him better than Matt, 
        who said unkind things about me. He was nicer?looking than Matt, with 
        his dark wavy hair-a suave type like Big Brother Bill, who was settling 
        down to married life now. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Las Vegas we'd sent Bill and Nancy a telegram signing 
        ourselves The Halfbright-Addlepates. With a BA in business management 
        from UCLA, John also did the accounts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next there was an old friend called Violet Carlson dropping 
        in now and then, a registered nurse like Nellie herself. Nellie indeed 
        had been one of the first RNs, and she was still proud to call herself 
        one. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violet was English, though you no longer heard it. Unfortunately 
        she had a facial tic that made looking at her as we talked, mostly about 
        England, a bit disconcerting. I'm not sure "old Vi" altogether approved 
        of me. Some people, including her and Matt, seemed to think I was taking 
        Nellie for a ride. Well, I was, but only in the sense of chauffeuring 
        the old girl. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This obviously wasn't an opinion shared by Nellie's 
        lawyer, George Spence. "Old George" was one of the kindest souls you could 
        ever hope to meet. He was a smallish man, nattily dressed, with old-fashioned 
        manners, and a merry twinkle in his bright blue eyes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George had offices in downtown LA and a son called Jerry, 
        who became a flamboyant trial lawyer, given to wearing cowboy outfits 
        in the courtroom, I understand. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his wife joined us for dinner one night at the 
        Bel Air Hotel in Beverly Hills (wrongly called Beverly Hills Hotel in 
        last week's installment). Taking me aside, George told me Nell was having 
        a "codicil" added to her will. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was news to me, as well as a new word, with a vaguely 
        reptilian sound. If I "played my cards right," he added, winking at me, 
        she might add another later. I didn't know how to play cards, I laughed, 
        and was quite happy with the pocket money she gave me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I liked teasing Nellie about her wealth. Would she 
        buy me a sports car, I jokingly used to ask her-a Porsche or a Mercedes 
        with butterfly doors. Clark Gable owned one, and, when out shopping in 
        Westwood, parked it on another property of hers, which was leased to a 
        garage. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this she invariably replied, throwing her head back 
        and laughing till tears came to her spotted eyes, "If I did, Lou, I wouldn't 
        see you for dust!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One bright, smogless day, we drove out to Pasadena to 
        see old friends of hers, the Smiths. Ernie Smith, in insurance now, had 
        played football for USC and been voted an all-American player. A hunk 
        of a man, he still looked the part.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at albums filled with press clippings and photos 
        from his glory days made me think of quarterback Harvey Stephens, my Bowdoin 
        roommate who had just graduated. I don't even remember saying good-bye 
        to Harvey, and I wonder if he remembers "Limy." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, Ernie and his wife took us to the Hollywood 
        Bowl to hear Harry Belafonte and the Belafonte Singers, one of whom, called 
        Gilbert Price, became a singer in his own right. I met him in New York 
        years later. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone else gave us tickets for the trial showing of 
        a Cinerama film complete with smell. All sorts of scents were released 
        into the auditorium through air vents, each one to go with a particular 
        scene or sight, for example an orange cut in half. Only pleasant smells, 
        mind you. Still, the idea didn't catch on. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a trip to San Diego, we stayed with one of Nell's 
        nephews, George Rutan, a ranger at a nearby national park. Rutan was Nellie's 
        maiden name and was of French Huguenot origin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flying buff, George offered to take her and me up 
        in his small sports plane, my first flight ever. He had a son, also called 
        George, who in the mid-eighties made headlines by flying round the world 
        in an H-shaped glider with his girlfriend. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greeted on their return to Vandenberg Air Force Base 
        by a crowd of a hundred thousand, there was also a call from the White 
        House waiting for them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we left to go back East, "old Earl" took Nell 
        and me out for dinner at The Beachcomber, a Hollywood restaurant frequented 
        by celebrities. Having neglected to reserve a table, he talked the maitre 
        d' into giving us one by telling him a bare-faced lie. I was the nephew 
        of Dr. Adenauer, the West German Chancellor, he said in his most convincing 
        bedside manner. Leaving me to read the menu to Nellie, he excused himself 
        to go to the "little boys' room." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning after what seemed an awfully long time, he 
        told us, with atypically serious mien, that something terrible had happened. 
        "See that gentleman over there," he said to me, inclining his head as 
        inconspicuously as possible towards a distinguished?looking figure at 
        a table not far from us, "that's General Omar Bradley, of World War Two 
        fame, an old pal of Ike." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What was so terrible about that?" I wondered. "Well," 
        George explained, "I'm afraid the maitre d' has told Bradley you're Adenauer's 
        nephew, and now the General wants to meet you." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nellie looked aghast. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You shouldn't have done that, Earl." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Never mind," I said, "I'll go over and pretend I really 
        am." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it was Earl's turn to look aghast and sheepish. 
        That wasn't the reaction he'd expected. The whole thing had been one of 
        his practical jokes, he confessed. Pity, I thought. <br>
