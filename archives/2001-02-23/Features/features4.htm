      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear Dr. Jeff:</b> What's the difference between 
        a bacterial and a viral STD? J.B.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear J.B.:</b> Bacterial STDs (Sexually Transmitted 
        Diseases), such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia, are caused by bacteria, 
        and are treated with antibiotics. Viral STDs, such as HPV (Human Papillomavirus 
        or genital warts), herpes (HSV), hepatitis (types B and C), and HIV/AIDS 
        are caused by viruses, and can be alleviated with antiviral treatments. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacterial STDs can be cured; viral STDs have no cure, 
        and in some cases can be fatal. Hepatitis B is the only STD that can be 
        prevented with a vaccine. The transmission of virtually all STDs can be 
        largely prevented through safer sex practices and by getting regular check-ups. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's estimated that about 25 percent of college students 
        are infected, or have been infected, with an STD. Chlamydia, genital warts, 
        and herpes are by far the most common. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember that often the most frequent symptom 
        of any STD is no symptom at all. Again, prevention through safer sex practices 
        is the key.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 80 percent of women and 40 percent of men who 
        are diagnosed with chlamydia have experienced no warning signs or symptoms. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untreated chlamydia infections in women can cause pelvic 
        inflammatory disease, scarring and infertility. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incubation period for genital warts may be many 
        months and even years, and some people harbor the virus and transmit it 
        to others, without first developing the warty growths themselves; warts 
        can also grow inside the vagina and are difficult to see. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some strains cause cervical cancer. Cervical herpes 
        infections can cause abnormal Pap tests as well. Herpes virus can be shed 
        in between outbreaks, when no ulcers or symptoms are present. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available treatments for both genital warts and herpes 
        alleviate symptoms, but do not completely eliminate the viruses themselves.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis B and C viruses are present in all body fluids 
        of infected individuals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the U.S., there are an estimated 1.5 million carriers 
        of Hepatitis B and 4 million carriers of Hepatitis C. Most have no symptoms, 
        and risk developing cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this country, Hepatitis B is primarily transmitted 
        through sexual contact and needle sharing; it is highly contagious, far 
        more so than HIV or Hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is fortunately an uncommon 
        STD. About half of those infected with Hepatitis C go on to develop chronic 
        and often fatal liver diseases. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned above, there is an effective vaccine against 
        Hepatitis B, but none yet for Hepatitis C.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIV/AIDS is certainly the most frightening of the viral 
        STDs, and will be the subject of a column in the near future.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safer sex guidelines are freely available on the Web 
        (you can use the links in the Health Issues section of our <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/dept/health/">website</a>), 
        at the Health Center, through peer educator groups on campus, and many 
        other sources.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condoms and dental dams are available free of charge 
        at the Health Center. We're working on placing vending machines with supplies 
        in the bathrooms of Smith Union.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A parting thought on viral STD transmission: Even in 
        a mutually monogamous relationship, you may be having sex only with your 
        partner, but you are also "contacting" everyone he or she has ever had 
        sex with, and with everyone those people have ever had sex with, etc. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a decision for yourself about safer sex practices, 
        discuss it with your partner, and protect yourselves-from viral and bacterial 
        STDs.<br>
