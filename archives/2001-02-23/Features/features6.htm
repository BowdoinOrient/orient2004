      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3">Regardless of gender, race, or age, 
        most people know someone who suffered, or continues to suffer, from an 
        eating disorder. The upcoming National Eatings Disorders Awareness Week 
        (February 25-March 5) is meant to educate and support both those people 
        suffering from eating disorders and their friends and families.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5 million Americans currently suffer from 
        eating disorders. According to the Harvard Eating Disorders Center, in 
        a recently-conducted study of 682 undergraduate female students, 61% of 
        college women were classified as having some intermediate form of disordered 
        eating.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARRIORS, Bowdoin's body image and eating disorders 
        awareness group, will host several events in recognition of Eating Disorders 
        Awareness Week. Catherine Steiner-Adair '76, Ed.D., the Director of Education, 
        Prevention, and Outreach at the Harvard Center for Eating Disorders, will 
        speak to Bowdoin students on Monday, at 8:00 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steiner-Adair is internationally recognized for her 
        clinical work and research in the areas of understanding, treating, and 
        preventing eating disorders. She is the director of &quot;Full of Ourselves: 
        Advancing Girl Power, Health, and Leadership,&quot; a program promoting 
        the healthy development of girls and the prevention of eating disorders.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Steiner-Adair's visit, WARRIORS is also 
        sponsoring a panel discussion about body image and eating disorders which 
        will take place on Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. in the Massachusetts Hall faculty 
        room. The panel will consist of members of the Dean's office, counselling 
        services, Dudley Coe Health Center, the Bowdoin Athletic Department, and 
        will also feature a recent alumnus. To conclude the week, an eating disorder 
        documentary film will be shown Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m. in Sills 
        Hall, Smith Auditorium. A candlelight vigil will follow the screening.</font></p>
