      </font><font size="2"><font size="3"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In high school, 
      my life was filled with normal teenage activities: I studied, I ran track, 
      and I hung out with some amazing friends. But around age fourteen, my life 
      also became largely shaped by my relationship with my body, its flaws, and 
      food. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took great pride in my ability to run races, to starve/ 
      purge away hunger, to remain hard and straight, and above all, to get away 
      with it. If it were not for some wonderful high school friends, I might 
      have gotten away with too much, and might not have made it to Bowdoin College. 
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember sitting at my desk as a high school senior, 
      completing one of my application essays-one of those generic, biggest accomplishment/obstacle 
      questions- and writing about my experience and "conquest" over anorexia 
      and bulimia. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote about a girl who pushed and pushed herself to 
      the edge, who caught herself "just in time" and was now "healthy." I remember 
      thinking that essay was a crock. But at seventeen, I also firmly believed 
      in my ability to leave the high school girl and her past in high school, 
      and to create a new, healthy, successful, college student in her place.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first year student, I entered Bowdoin with fear and 
      excitement over the prospects of near-absolute freedom. Sure, Bowdoin was 
      is an academically intimidating institution, but I was ready and able to 
      struggle and make the necessary sacrifices to achieve the success I had 
      known in high school. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I was not ready for, however, was the way that Bowdoin 
      would shape my continuous struggle with my body. I was not prepared for 
      my four years at Bowdoin to be another four-year fight with my eating disorders. 
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear to me after a short time at Bowdoin, that 
      a certain aesthetic prevailed-specifically, thin. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also clear that if one was not born with this aesthetic 
      (bad), there were ways to get there (good). The hard, lean body that I had 
      achieved so unhealthfully in high school fit right into this ideal. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to translate being tiny as being good, and sadly 
      this seemed to be an interpretation accepted by many others at Bowdoin. 
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the dining hall, I was painfully aware of what was 
      on my plate in comparison to others. My portions began to dwindle, and when 
      food decisions became too difficult, I would either throw caution to the 
      wind during meals and secretly purge, or I would skip meals altogether, 
      claiming to be swamped with work. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because shrinking meals and a heavy workload seemed hardly 
      a novelty, I felt almost fashionable in my schedule that was simply too 
      "jam-packed" to eat. I was again thin and lean; a machine that ran, worked, 
      and smiled on fumes. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I knew that my lifestyle was painful and dangerous, 
      it hardly seemed out of the ordinary to me, and if my result was a more 
      controlled body, then it seemed a small price to pay. Eventually, through 
      the support and concern of my friends, I sought counseling on a number of 
      occasions, each time in more pain, more anger, and more uncertainty in my 
      ability to overcome these diseases.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the fall semester of my junior year, my 
      physical condition had deteriorated to a state that it appeared unlikely 
      I would return to Bowdoin in the spring. However, after a winter break with 
      a lot of personal work (and under the threats of my parents) I did return 
      to Bowdoin, and I made plans to study away the following semester. It would 
      be a time to "grow" and to "explore"- or at least that's what I told myself 
      and my family- but I knew that it was a test to see if I could get my act 
      together in that time away from Bowdoin. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here I am, in the last semester of my senior year, 
      and I have passed the test. Not aced, and perhaps not even earned a B, but 
      I have passed and I am still here, overjoyed to be graduating with the same 
      dear, inspiring friends that marked my college experience. I will freely 
      admit that my semester away was not perfect. It was certainly amazing and 
      wonderful, but it was not a complete escape from my eating disorders. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that these disorders will continue to appear 
      in my life, both emotionally and physically. I do hope my physical ramifications 
      will eventually fade to scars that remind me of the battle that I fought 
      and won against anorexia and bulimia. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know too many outstanding people, people that I want 
      to remain in my life, and who struggle with eating disorders, that I refuse 
      to just give in to these diseases. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating Disorders Awareness Week is a chance for everyone 
      in the Bowdoin community to learn about eating disorders, and to offer hope 
      and support to those that fight these painful illnesses each day. Please 
      take time out, and attend any functions you can. <br>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I arrived at Bowdoin in the fall of 1996, I had 
        been suffering with severe eating disorders for one and a half years. 
        I had attended a boarding school in Massachusetts and during the winter 
        of my junior year, I developed anorexia, bulimia and an obsession with 
        exercise.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began eating less and less while exercise began consuming 
        more and more of my day. If I did eat, I would immediately return to my 
        dorm and throw up. This obsessive behavior continued for the rest of my 
        junior year, and by the fall of my senior year, I had lost seventy-five 
        pounds. I was a shell of my former self. My face was sunken and hollow; 
        my abdomen was laced with protruding veins, and my ribs and spine protruded 
        from my back. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could barely make it through the day without passing 
        out. My thoughts and actions were dominated by the negativity of my disease. 
        I no longer thought about anything but food and exercise. However, no 
        one stepped in to stop what had become an extremely destructive lifestyle. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received only compliments for my drastic weight loss. 
        It never occurred to my friends and teachers that I had an eating disorder, 
        because I was a guy, and they assumed that only women had eating disorders.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fall of my first year at Bowdoin, I could 
        no longer handle the pain that I was inflicting upon my body and mind. 
        One of my friends had told me about a support group that had been organized 
        by Counseling Services, and I called one of the counselors to find out 
        if I could join the group.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She began to pepper me with questions in order to ascertain 
        whether I was making a prank call. I got scared and hung up on her. I 
        would never again seek professional help. I befriended many of the women 
        in that support group in later years and found that none of them were 
        subject to the same questioning when they approached the same counselor.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a male victim of an eating disorder, I was allowed 
        to slip through Bowdoin's safety net of support, and I continued to suffer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I began to tackle my disease on my own over the next 
        three years at Bowdoin. I started slowly. I would refrain from weighing 
        myself for several days. I would force myself to eat a full meal without 
        throwing up afterwards. My life was a perpetual roller coaster of healthy 
        spells followed by periods of extreme fasting and pain. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would return to my dorm room in the early evening 
        in excruciating pain that I can't even describe. I would come home and 
        ball up on my floor, unable to move, wracked with so much pain that it 
        would drive me to tears. I would spend the rest of the night unable to 
        complete my homework due to the severe hallucinations brought on by the 
        extreme stress placed on my body. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spring of my sophomore year, I remember going 
        into a calculus test during one of these bad spells. My body was so stressed 
        and wracked with pain that I could not focus my eyes enough to read the 
        typed questions. I sat unmoving in my seat for the duration of the test, 
        only to hand back a blank test paper to the professor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Academic work was a near impossibility because I wasn't 
        consuming the necessary carbohydrates required for proper brain function. 
        However, over my four years at Bowdoin, these bad spells grew shorter 
        and I began to gain control over my own life, and today I have recovered 
        from the diseases that dominated my life for five years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, eating disorders have changed me physically 
        as well as emotionally. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating disorder victims have the highest death rate 
        of any victims of mental illness due to the severe stress placed on the 
        victim's body. I am much more likely to contract throat and mouth cancer 
        due to my bulimia, and my anorexia has most likely damaged my heart and 
        other internal organs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is likely that I will die earlier than I would have 
        if I had remained healthy through those years.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my work with WARRIORS, and as a high school 
        teacher, I have shared my story with almost 2,000 young people. I have 
        spent countless hours helping others through their own struggles with 
        eating disorders. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible for me to put into words the pain and 
        agony caused by these diseases. I have seen the lives of my best friend, 
        my sister, my students, and countless other friends, male and female alike, 
        torn apart by eating disorders. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also seen the beauty and the amazing rebirth 
        of these same people as they have come to grips with their own battle 
        and have begun to regain positive control of their emotions, bodies, and 
        lives. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eating disorders are issues that affect each and every 
        one of us. I can only hope that Bowdoin continues to improve its dedication 
        to supporting those who are suffering. I have won my personal battle with 
        eating disorders, but I will continue to help others overcome their own 
        struggles. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Eating Disorders Awareness Week, I hope that 
        the Bowdoin community will actively participate in the panels, workshops, 
        and talks prepared by WARRIORS so that we can become more aware and sensitive 
        of the diseases that continue to affect our peers and our loved ones.

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="2">Regardless of gender, race, or age, most 
        people know someone who suffered, or continues to suffer, from an eating 
        disorder. The upcoming National Eatings Disorders Awareness Week (February 
        25-March 5) is meant to educate and support both those people suffering 
        from eating disorders and their friends and families.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 5 million Americans currently suffer from 
        eating disorders. According to the Harvard Eating Disorders Center, in 
        a recently-conducted study of 682 undergraduate female students, 61% of 
        college women were classified as having some intermediate form of disordered 
        eating.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARRIORS, Bowdoin's body image and eating disorders 
        awareness group, will host several events in recognition of Eating Disorders 
        Awareness Week. Catherine Steiner-Adair '76, Ed.D., the Director of Education, 
        Prevention, and Outreach at the Harvard Center for Eating Disorders, will 
        speak to Bowdoin students on Monday, at 8:00 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steiner-Adair is internationally recognized for her 
        clinical work and research in the areas of understanding, treating, and 
        preventing eating disorders. She is the director of &quot;Full of Ourselves: 
        Advancing Girl Power, Health, and Leadership,&quot; a program promoting 
        the healthy development of girls and the prevention of eating disorders.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Steiner-Adair's visit, WARRIORS is also 
        sponsoring a panel discussion about body image and eating disorders which 
        will take place on Wednesday at 7:00 p.m. in the Massachusetts Hall faculty 
        room. The panel will consist of members of the Dean's office, counselling 
        services, Dudley Coe Health Center, the Bowdoin Athletic Department, and 
        will also feature a recent alumnus. To conclude the week, an eating disorder 
        documentary film will be shown Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m. in Sills 
        Hall, Smith Auditorium. A candlelight vigil will follow the screening.<br>
