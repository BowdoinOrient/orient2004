      <p align="left">Many Bowdoin ladies had mixed feelings after the February 25 finale of ABC's The Bachelorette, when Bowdoin's very own Ian McKee '98 went from single to engaged.  He not only stole the heart of the show's star, Meredith Phillips, but also those of the female viewers who dreamed of having a chance with the Brazilian-born hottie.  Nevertheless, the College community was thrilled when Meredith chose the Bowdoin grad.  </p>
<p align="left">According to Peter Wagner, Associate Director of Alumni Relations, a "pretty fair number" of Bowdoin students end up with other Polar Bears, but this does not hold true for the now-famous McKee, after he fell in love with, and then proposed to, Phillips, all for America to watch.  Girls around the country are envious of the future Mrs. McKee, a 30-year-old Portland, Oregon native who currently works as a make-up artist and model in Los Angeles.</p>
<p align="left">Regardless of the jealously, this season of The Bachelorette was a success like those before it, helping to heat up living rooms and captivate audiences all winter long.</p>
<p align="left">One of the pioneering reality shows, The Bachelor and The Bachelorette follow a single on his or her quest for love.  He or she must weed through a group of 25 singles, narrowing down the selection weekly by presenting a rose to each of those who will stay.  Once only one remains, the question becomes, "Will there be a proposal?," and is quickly followed by, "Will it last?"  </p>
<p align="left">The strength of McKee and Phillip's relationship is on the minds of all viewers who are curious as to how long their prime-time television love will last.  Given the track record of previous reality TV couples, the two certainly have the odds stacked against them; however, after speaking with McKee, all doubts of the couple following in those footsteps are erased.</p>
<p align="left">Extremely enthusiastic about his relationship, McKee has been spending a lot of time with Phillips and comments that they are doing well, adding that he has "been looking to settle down for a while."  The integrity of the relationship is no surprise, since Phillips, previously a contender on <i>The Bachelor</i>, was familiar with dating in the public eye and was committed to getting it right the second time around.  </p>
<p align="left">On the show, Phillips described her bond with McKee as an "unspoken relationship that doesn't make sense." She confessed her feelings to him-and 13.5 million viewers-in the final episode after she dismissed his competitor, Matthew. Phillips certainly found what she was looking for, and, with tears of joy exclaimed, "I want to be with you and I don't ever see myself without you...I am absolutely so, so in love with you it's crazy, and I've never felt like this before."  </p>
<p align="left">In what was deemed by host Chris Harrison as "the most amazing rose ceremony yet," McKee reciprocated her feeling by telling her, "I found my soulmate."</p>
<p align="left">In her online diary, Phillips reasserted her love for Ian: "The fact that [Ian] is going to be in my life forever makes me happier than I can say...Ian could have given me a ring out of a gumball machine; that is how much I love him.  It doesn't matter; all that matters is that we are together now."</p>
<p align="left">Whether it was his ability to pull off a sweatband, his careful maneuver of the dad-bomb, or his overall good looks, we will never know exactly what set McKee apart from the other contenders. We do know that Bowdoin tuned in to channel eight, week after week to watch the couple go from strangers to fianc‚es in a mere seven episodes.  </p>
<p align="left">Romance aside, the pertinent question is, "What was Ian like here?" It's hard to believe that the one-time Polar Bear was just like the rest of us.  The economics major and Spanish minor spent his time under the pines on the lacrosse and soccer fields, in addition to being active in the International Club.  </p>
<p align="left">Thomas McCabe, head coach of the men's lacrosse team, still vividly remembers the competitive defensive middie and says McKee stayed very true to his personality while on the show.  Describing McKee as "pretty shy," "a great guy," and "a gentleman," McCabe also mentioned that McKee had a very attractive girlfriend during his time at Bowdoin, which is not difficult to imagine.  </p>
<p align="left">Ian was not so long ago cramming for tests in H-L, brunching at Thorne, and yes, even participating in the Bowdoin social scene. He even alluded to run-ins with Bowdoin Security after he, in his last interview with the Orient, made sure to add, "Tell Bowdoin Security that I say 'hi.'"  </p>
<p align="left">After Bowdoin, McKee went on to New York City to work in equity research sales.</p>
<p align="left">Despite just finishing the season, which aired from January 14 to February 25, McKee hasn't forgotten his roots, and graciously put aside time in his busy schedule to talk to the Orient.  </p>
<p align="left">Orient:  How are you and Meredith doing?</p>
<p align="left">Ian McKee:  Great!  Right now we are doing a McKee family road show.  I am introducing Meredith to my family.  Apparently, it was very controversial not showing them on the show, which I find funny.  She met my grandparents last night and we are now going to Florida to see my parents.  </p>
<p align="left">O:  Is your brother mad at you for proposing to her?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  Absolutely not!  We are extremely close; he is my best friend.  He was only looking out for me-wanting to make sure that I was thinking straight and not getting brainwashed by the show.</p>
<p align="left">O:  How are you and Meredith different from other reality TV couples?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  I don't really know any others.  I don't watch reality TV.</p>
<p align="left">O:  Did the show try and hide the chemistry between you and Meredith?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  That was the tragedy of the show-the best parts are never shown since they need a surprise at the end.  The producers admitted to having to air the worst parts of the relationship since it would have been too obvious otherwise.  Meredith and I joke that they should show an uncut version.</p>
<p align="left">O:  How has your life changed?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  So far there is not much change.  I have great friends and they are really realistic, and I don't surround myself with people who would kiss up or brown-nose just because I was on TV.  When I am on the street, people don't look twice, but Meredith and I were in New York City's East Village this weekend and that did get some attention.  People mostly would say congratulations and keep walking.  She did a fashion shoot on Tuesday night and it was weird at that point.  There were lots of cameras and people were hounding us for info.  The reality TV audience is fickle though, and it will blow over quickly-as soon as another show airs.  </p>
<p align="left">O:  What was your Bowdoin social life like?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  I lived with my close group of friends who were soccer players.  There were frats at the time and we were welcome at all of them, but it was hard to go from city life and then come to Bowdoin.  I definitely recommend going abroad; it was the best thing.</p>
<p align="left">O:  What was your romantic life like at Bowdoin?  </p>
<p align="left">McKee:  I dated a really gorgeous girl for six years; we were together my entire Bowdoin time.  I was lucky enough to be in a wonderful relationship and I don't regret it.</p>
<p align="left">O:  What is your love advice for Bowdoin students?</p>
<p align="left">McKee:  Geez Louise.  I had a unique situation so I can't really comment, but you should make the most of your time. You are still very young when you graduate and will learn a lot about yourself after Bowdoin.</p>
<p align="left">O:  Is there a possible Bowdoin visit in the future? </p>
<p align="left">McKee:  I don't want to make any promises, but absolutely...sure.  I would try to make it out before the end of the year.  I have only visited once since I graduated and am excited to see the changes.  I would love to visit, maybe show Meredith where I went to school.  I was surprised to know that Bowdoin was watching the show.  Thanks for the support!</p>
<p align="left">Good luck to Ian and Meredith! If their relationship does not work out, he need only look to the many Bowdoin girls who had put aside work each Wednesday night to religiously congregate around the TVs in their common rooms, only dreaming of being in Meredith's position.</p>
