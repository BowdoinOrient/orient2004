      </table>
      <p align="left">After a rare weekend off, the Bowdoin Women's Hockey Team re-asserted itself by defeating in-state NESCAC rival Colby College 4-0 on Tuesday.  </p>
<p align="left">Team captain and one of Bowdoin's offensive leaders Marissa O'Neil '05 led the charge, picking up two goals in the game.  O'Neil commented, "Despite the fact that it wasn't our best effort, the team as a whole moved the puck well in the offensive zone and created lots of great opportunities.  We found seams in the defense and were able to connect on our passing which allowed us to find the net."  </p>
<p align="left">Also tallying goals in the contest against the Mules were Kelsey Wilcox '06 and Kate "Lenny" Leonard '07.  Teammate Jess Burke '04 said, "Lenny's goal was pure hustle, fought from center ice right down to the net."  According to Brit Carr '04, Wilcox's goal was to stand "strong in front of the net and do what she always does-fire the puck in the back of the goal."  </p>
<p align="left">"She whacked it," said Carr. "She's very talented and persistent when it comes to putting in those rebounds."  Wilcox herself claimed her goal was "nasty."</p>
<p align="left">So, while the Mules are still winless in the NESCAC, the Bears were not exactly satisfied with their level of play.  Many players observed that the level of play they displayed in Waterville would not be sufficient to get the job done against more formidable opponents.  </p>
<p align="left">On the brighter side of things, Burke offered, "Against Colby, even when we had a low point in a game, we never failed to rise above it and do what we needed to do to finish strong."</p>
<p align="left">Indeed, the Bears will need to "rise above" this weekend as they face their two undisputedly toughest NESCAC opponents, Williams and Middlebury.  Despite beating each team on away ice, Bowdoin will have to pick up its level of play in order to defend itself (and its pride) in Dayton Arena.  </p>
<p align="left">Confidence among the Polar Bears is abundant though, with Carr stating, "Last year they came up here and went home with a loss, and this year should be no different.  We are so fired up by Middlebury [who the Bears meet tomorrow], but Friday night is going to be a great game too.  We are looking to come out of the weekend with two big wins."  </p>
<p align="left">O'Neil corroborated, "I'm excited because I think our team is more prepared for these games in comparison to the tougher games we faced at the beginning of the season.  Also exciting is being home and just knowing that we have the support of the school.  Playing with that pride is exhilarating, especially for the younger players."  </p>
<p align="left">That excitement is certainly contagious as Wilcox also observed, "We are clicking really well.  It is exciting going into the play-offs with a young team.  People think we are underdogs, but we know we have the potential to beat anyone."  </p>
<p align="left"> 	One of the keys for  Bowdoin's continued success truly will come from the fans.  Countless Polar Bears stressed the importance of crowd support in order to overcome these hated rivals.  Diehard fans Lizzie Jones '04 and Nicole Stiffle '04 were adamant about the need for people to check out the pair of games.  Stiffle surmised that this weekend is "going to prove who rules NESCAC.  I hope as many people come to the women's games as came to the men's."  </p>
<p align="left">Jones, a fan who enjoys seeing a good tussle on the ice, eagerly shouted, "You better be there!  30 College will be there with florescent posters!"  	</p>
<p align="left">So don't sit at home, bummed out because Janet didn't get to perform her tribute to Luther Vandross at the Grammy's or because you find yourself alone (again) on the grand holiday of St. Valentine!  Stand up, put down your US Weekly, and head over to the hockey rink (Friday against Williams at 7:00 p.m. and Saturday against Middlebury at 3:00 p.m.).  </p>
<p align="left">Those Bears out there need your energy, they need your fire, and maybe, just maybe, if you stick around for a bit, they'll give you a hug of appreciation when they head out of the locker room.  If there is any apprehension about the quality of action you'll witness, Jess Burke officially threw the gauntlet when asked what she would like to say to Williams and Middlebury.  </p>
<p align="left">Burke bragged, "Don't doubt that we are going to bring it this weekend. Get ready to lose and head back here for NESCACs one more time."  It appears Jones was not exaggerating when she gleefully cheered, "There are going to be some fights!"</p>
