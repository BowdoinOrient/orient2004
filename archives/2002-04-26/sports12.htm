      <p align="left">If you heard strains of Queen's &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; 
        ringing through campus recently, you probably know that the women's track 
        and field squad won the Aloha Relays last Saturday. The women left the 
        stadium running and singing to celebrate their victory over rivals Colby, 
        Bates, Mt. Holyoke, the University of Southern Maine, and the University 
        of Massachusetts at Lowell. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The women were especially motivated to perform well after 
        last week's loss to Colby at MIT. Their team score of 192.5 points beat 
        the second-place White Mules by 54 points.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It wasn't a runaway victory, though. At the Alohas' halfway 
        point, Bowdoin and Colby were tied with 83.5 points each. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, several surprising races and one-two-three finishes 
        in the 3000-meter and triple jump events gave the Bears a final push over 
        Colby.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For senior captain Casey Kelley, the team's hard-fought 
        victory at the relays meant more to her than defending her Aloha triple 
        jump title for the third year in a row. Jumping 39 feet and 9.25 inches, 
        she led the way for fellow teammates Acadia Senese '03 and captain Karen 
        Yeoman '02, who placed right behind her at second and third in the event. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both captains were thrilled at teammate Senese's personal 
        record. &quot;Acadia's personal best performance in the triple jump was 
        inspiring,&quot; Yeoman said. &quot;She is poised to do great things in 
        the upcoming championship season.&quot; <br>
        Casey said that hearing the final team scores and the announcement of 
        Bowdoin's victory meant a lot to the seniors. &quot;It was our last home 
        meet, and it was only the third time in 14 years that Bowdoin has won 
        Alohas,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Performances from Meka Decyk '02 in the pole vault, Marybeth 
        Sexton '05 and Ellen Beth '05 in the 5000-meter, and Julia Febiger '03 
        in the 400 meter hurdles helped solidify the Bowdoin win.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of the day's biggest achievements came from Febiger. 
        She took a commanding lead after the first 100 meters, and ran the remaining 
        part of the race alone. Her winning time of 1:03.44 was a time that qualified 
        her for outdoor nationals.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I was psyched with my race!&quot; she said. &quot;My 
        attitude for this season is to go for it during every race, because I 
        realized that you can't wait around for the perfect one. You have to make 
        it happen yourself.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Febiger is currently ranked sixth in Division III women's 
        400 hurdles. Decyk, who hadn't competed the previous weekend because of 
        illness, bounced back in time for the Alohas, vaulting a height of 10 
        feet and .75 inches to break her own school record and place second in 
        the event. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both Sexton and Beth had been running mid-distance events 
        throughout the season, but were placed in the 5000-meter run for the weekend-surprising 
        quite a few people. They both ran championship meet qualifying times in 
        their first 5000-meter race of the season. Sexton, with a time of 18:48.4, 
        marked a personal record by over a minute.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Alohas were the Bears' last meet of the regular season 
        before postseason qualifying races begin this weekend. The women hope 
        to carry last weekend's success over and make a strong showing at NESCACs 
        tomorrow and Sunday at Bates.</p>
