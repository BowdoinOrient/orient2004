      <p>The Bowdoin Men's Rugby Team continues its tradition of excellence and 
        victory as it proves its unrivalled level of play and virile athletic 
        mastery again this spring.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Riding high after the stupendous success of their fall season, where 
        they finished second in the Northeast and ninth in the nation, the ruggers 
        have surely made their collective mark already this spring. Though it 
        is not as formal or organized as the fall play, the spring season allows 
        the team to showcase their amazing collection of talents in ways heretofore 
        unimagined. <br>
      </p>
      <p>After intensive winter training, the team was ready for action. A strict 
        regime of &quot;can curls,&quot; distance runs as far as Uncle T's and 
        back, barrel lifts, and an intensive secret training program known only 
        as &quot;Quasimodo&quot; left the team in peak condition for a spring 
        of utter carnage and more ambulances filled with the bodies of their foes. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Team Adonis, Aryeh &quot;Why haven't you fixed my car yet, you imbecile?&quot; 
        Jasper had this to say about the training regimen: &quot;It was real tough 
        to stick to at first. It's a lot of work to make that level of commitment. 
        My key to survival was switching the PBJ in my lunch to PBR. The results, 
        well, you can see for yourself. My svelte physique, so impressive to the 
        ladies of this campus, is considered par for the ruggers that've been 
        on this training regimen.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers encountered their first test of 2002 on their Spring Break 
        tour. Traveling to the brutal North, where wolves and yeti routinely dismember 
        those unfortunate enough to be outside, the ruggers did battle with that 
        famed academic institution, the College of Montreal. As icy blasts obscured 
        vision and froze players in their boots, the ruggers valiantly stood against 
        the evil French-speaking foes. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It was a brutal match. Senior Kris &quot;Single&quot; Bosse was almost 
        locked up as he bravely and belligerently tried to march the ball into 
        the zone, but his lightning quick reflexes saved him. Junior Ryan &quot;The 
        Goat&quot; Brawn had an amazing steal that allowed him to score with great 
        gusto and vigor. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Man, I really needed that,&quot; said a still-stunned Goat the 
        next morning. &quot;Scoring like that not only contributed to our victory, 
        but definitely put a smile on my face for a while.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The real power in the game came from senior captain Billy &quot;Mom&quot; 
        Soares. Whilst his co-captain D'Nunzio spent the break lounging in his 
        ancestral compound outside Palermo, Billy put it on the line in the icy 
        cold, proving to all why he is called &quot;The Hot Lunch.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He was assisted by the team's resident senior heavyweights: Allan Barr, 
        Nick Miller, and Torrey Liddell. It looked like these three obese boys 
        had abandoned their teammates for sunnier, better looking conditions until 
        they teamed up to score a try off a handoff from senior Hugh &quot;Hank&quot; 
        Hill. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Said Hank afterwards, &quot;I may be getting old and worn-out, but I 
        still got my luck, whatever's that's worth, and she was certainly with 
        me out there in that mess.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>After defeating the Canadian menace, the ruggers were rewarded with a 
        feast at the Yankee Smoke-House by the grateful citizens of New Hampshire. 
        Over whole, spit-roasted pigs and piles of cooked meats, the ruggers compared 
        their victory in the North to their previous international triumph two 
        years prior in Jamaica. Not only did that tour allow the men of Bowdoin 
        Rugby to beat Jamaican national teams like &quot;The Jerk Chicken Men,&quot; 
        the &quot;Suicidal Cabbies,&quot; and &quot;The Negril Raiders,&quot; 
        but it also produced a trophy awarded specifically for international play. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The James Sawyer Memorial Trophy, portraying, for unknown reasons, a 
        beagle squatting by a bus, was unanimously awarded to first year Tom Hazel. 
        Not only did Hazel's early and accurate boots propel the team to victory, 
        but also his excellent level of play amazed both friend and foe alike 
        for its deftness and success. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus began the spring season, and the bodies began to pile up. Team after 
        team fell to the god-like ruggers of Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Shane O'Neill, the team ogre, appeared in one of these games. 
        Using his massive cranium as a weapon, O'Neill did his tea-totaling father 
        Rory proud and bludgeoned many a foe to death. Another senior to make 
        an appearance was L.A.'s finest gang-banger, senior Chad Colton. After 
        refusing to play for years due to recurring fears about ruining his future 
        career at Vivid Videos with an injury, he finally got the blessing from 
        his future-boss Peter North to participate. Colton immediately made his 
        presence felt on the pitch, shooting through the opposition for repeated 
        hits in the try zone. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin concluded the season with a 75-0 spanking of Maine Maritime. 
        The victory was delivered with aplomb and precision last Saturday. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There were startling performances by many. Legendary scrumhalf Matthew 
        Stanton '02 returned to the pitch for one last day of glory. Cheered on 
        from the sidelines by his fourteen wives, the Mormon patriarch betrayed 
        a side of him not seen since his wild, sinful, and godless youth. His 
        dashing and brutal play proved he could still be the &quot;Man of Action.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Matching Stanton's power was senior Adam Corman. Raised by skunks in 
        the swamps of the local toxic waste dump, Corman has developed a unique 
        and lethal olfactory-assault strategy. Guaranteed to leave the opposition 
        at the very least gasping for air (deaths are not uncommon), Corman's 
        patented &quot;Sack Attack&quot; paralyzed the opposition. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Said senior Nathaniel &quot;Crabs&quot; Wolf, &quot;Corman's odor is 
        powerful. I think I'm tough, heck I don't wear cleats, let alone shoes 
        during our matches, but I got nothing on the Sack Attack.&quot; Gagging 
        opponents agreed with Crabs. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the huge size of the Maritime pack (their average weight was 
        around three hundred pounds), the forwards held their own. Senior Dave 
        &quot;Benedict&quot; McDonald, Bowdoin's sharpest dressed man, provided 
        key power in punching through their opposition, allowing the ruggers to 
        walk all over their foes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After the game, many of the Maritime players were so impressed by the 
        prowess of the Bowdoin side that they immediately expressed their desire 
        to join the team. Some might have been successful in that endeavor; the 
        results are not expected in until next week.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus comes to an end another year of stunning successes for the boys 
        in black. So next year, as Bowdoin continues its tradition of championship 
        rugby, come on out and watch the team that always guarantees a win and 
        a body count. Go Black! </p>
