      <p align="left"><font size="5">Rockefeller clouds numbers and ideology</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I am writing in response to Patrick Rockefeller's opinion piece [&quot;Judging 
        the actions of terrorists,&quot; April 19, 2002] that mentioned the Disorient's 
        list of casualties in the Israel/Palestine conflict. While I am not a 
        member of the Disorient staff, I feel that the numbers listed were not 
        intended to show that &quot;Israel is the brutal, oppressive government 
        and that the Palestinians are victims.&quot; Such a list is also not a 
        &quot;prime example of moral equivalency.&quot; Is a list of facts not 
        the very opposite of an example of moral equivalency? <br>
      </p>
      <p>The writer continues by saying the list suggests that Israel is at fault 
        and Palestinians are the victims. How could simple figures say so much? 
        <br>
        If anything, I feel that the Disorient was trying to give a little objective 
        perspective to a situation that is terribly clouded by ideological rhetoric. 
        Such an illogical association between numbers and ideology only serves 
        to cloud the issue further.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Plus/minus debate is very 
        relevant</font></p>
      <p align="left">To The Editors:</p>
      <p>In her recent Orient column [&quot;Recent plus minus debate is truly 
        ironic,&quot; April 19, 2002], Genevieve Creedon dismissed the student 
        movement against the plus/minus grading system as laughable and compared 
        its significance to her sock choice. While I'm glad Creedon gets a kick 
        out of this movement, I would like to suggest to her and to this campus 
        that no issue which students deem important is laughable. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I agree that the plus/minus grading system does not have widespread ramifications 
        for world hunger or the violence currently wracking many parts of the 
        globe. I'm also inclined to agree that campus activism still has room 
        for growth as innovative campus publications arise and discourse begins 
        anew. However, the grading issue is indicative of a larger pattern of 
        miscommunication and a lack of dialogue between the faculty and students 
        on this campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Students have a right to know and to contribute to the conversations 
        occurring with Faculty and administrators. Issues like grading, the role 
        of athletics on campus, and admissions policies ultimately affect us as 
        students, and we need to encourage this school to foster increased communication 
        prior to harmful decisions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Whether or not plus/minus grading has a prolonged effect should be a 
        secondary concern. Foremost is whether or not the Faculty is willing to 
        consider important student polls and create discussion. These simple themes 
        should assume a top priority in the minds of faculty members. Likewise, 
        students must respond to those prompts and questionnaires provided by 
        the administration and elaborate on our needs. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ms. Creedon should not wait for a &quot;thirst&quot; to strike and sweep 
        her away in &quot;causes that are actually worthwhile,&quot; when greater 
        concerns already exist. If plus/minus grading indeed becomes the impetus 
        for creating a better Bowdoin College, than so be it. That would be neither 
        a &quot;sad commentary&quot; on our principles, nor &quot;hilarious.&quot;</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Response to Meat-Out a disappointment</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I was disappointed and offended at the negative response generated by 
        the Great American Meat-Out last Wednesday. It was not the chalked paths, 
        emails, and signs, but rather what I heard in dining hall lines that disturbed 
        me. The fact that an event merely designed to educate Bowdoin students 
        received such an aggressively negative response shows a severe close-mindedness. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>I'm not sure why, but more than any other ethical question, I've noticed 
        that vegetarianism creates in its opponents a confrontational defensiveness. 
        To think, they might be in the same room as someone who doesn't eat meat, 
        someone different from them! The number of times I, as a vegetarian, have 
        been put through an ethical inquisition at the dinner table is ridiculous. 
        &quot;Why do you think you're so much better than meat eaters?&quot; &quot;What 
        if I told you that I had put meat in the soup you're eating right now? 
        What would you do?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>I am not opposed to questions, nor am I opposed to dissent, but I am 
        opposed to unwarranted belligerence. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Great American Meat-Out was not, contrary to what I heard in the 
        dining halls on Wednesday, ordering people not to eat meat, but rather 
        suggesting. It asked people to cut meat from their diets for one day in 
        order to reflect on why they eat it, and at what cost. Eating meat is 
        a choice, and a meat-eater is no better or worse than a vegetarian. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But meat-eaters who have considered the issue fully, rather than blindly 
        swinging back at vegetarians, are worthy of much more respect. In my opinion, 
        no one who eats meat can consider himself or herself a humanitarian or 
        social activist-but that is only my opinion. In no way will I ever force 
        that opinion on you, ever. Granted I won't let you turn your back on the 
        truths of eating meat, but I won't judge you for your decision. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So I say to the Meat-Eaters Protective Alliance, take it easy! Please 
        don't be so afraid of us crazy &quot;National Don't Eat Meat Day To Save 
        the Earth and Stuff&quot; hippies.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="4"></a>Faculty shouldn't represent 
        public opinion</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Gill Barndollar writes [Orient, April 5, 2002] that &quot;College faculty 
        [are] out of touch with U.S.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>There is no sense in which college faculties ought to be representative 
        of the opinion of the people. They are not members of Congress or any 
        other representative body. The role of intellectuals, rather, is to be 
        questioning and critical.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Most (but not all) people in the humanities and social sciences have 
        concluded that over the past few centuries, conservatives have generally-not 
        always or in all details-been wrong, while liberals-not always or on all 
        details-have been right. From opposition to democracy in the 18th century 
        to opposition to racial equality in the 20th, conservatives have been 
        on the wrong side of history. In the well-chosen words of James Carville, 
        &quot;we're right and they're wrong.&quot;</p>

      <p align="left">Dear Seniors:</p>
      <p>With senior week and graduation fast approaching, it isn't long before 
        we will join the ranks of Bowdoin alumni/ae. In anticipation of that transition, 
        our class must choose four members who will represent us and remain in 
        close contact with the College after we leave. I would like to take some 
        time to tell you about the class officer positions and the upcoming elections 
        for those positions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The President works closely with the Secretary of the College to coordinate 
        class activities post graduation, in addition to serving as the liason 
        to the Alumni Office for the Class of 2002. The Vice President assists 
        the President in planning reunions and class activities and in maintaining 
        close communication between the Class of 2002 and Bowdoin College. The 
        two Class Reporters are responsible for updating the class and the College 
        on the activities and whereabouts of the members of the Class of 2002. 
        The Class Reporters work with the President and Vice President and contact 
        the class through mailings, phone calls, and PolarNet. Each position requires 
        a term of five years, with new elections being held at every fifth year 
        reunion. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each Bowdoin alumni class has a class President, Vice President, and 
        two Class Reporters. Candidates for the four positions have already been 
        chosen from the members of the Young Alumni Leadership Program (YALP). 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Elections will be held next Thursday night, May 2, outside the pub, and 
        the following Friday, May10, during the day in Smith Union. Class officers 
        are an integral part of the alumni network. Please come out and vote next 
        Thursday and Friday for those candidates whom you feel would best represent 
        the Class of 2002 over the next five years. Thank you. </p>
