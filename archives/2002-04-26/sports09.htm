        <br>
        Senior captain Kristie Miller, who led the Bowdoin softball team offensively 
        this week by hitting two home runs in Tuesday's game against Bates, boldly 
        stated recently, &quot;I had no shame about my game on Tuesday.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Indeed. The Bears, as a team, have no shame either. They 
        currently stand tall with a 21-8-1 record. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last weekend was full of play as Bowdoin went 3-1 in the 
        Colby tournament, facing Brandeis, Colby, and St. Joseph's twice. Their 
        only loss came at the second meeting with St. Joe's.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Jessie Poulin pitched a complete game-a three-hit 
        shutout-against the Monks from St. Joe's on Saturday. Kristi Royer '03 
        went two for four, continuing to light it up for the Bears at the plate. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jordan Alper '02, Emily Rizza '02, and rookie Gillian Stevens 
        '04 all scored runs for Bowdoin in the victory. Stevens was responsible 
        for the first run, and scored on a fantastic dirt-in-the-skirt dive to 
        home plate through the catcher's legs. Her desire for the win was evident 
        and fueled the team with plenty of fire.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the second game of the afternoon versus Brandeis, senior 
        Katie Sheridan launched the ball deep over the outfield fence for her 
        first collegiate home run. &quot;She made the mistake of throwing one 
        of those meatballs right down the middle instead of the outside,&quot; 
        Sheridan said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sophomore pitcher Erin Hanley was stellar on the mound, 
        allowing only two runs on four hits. Rizza and Alper again accounted for 
        scored runs in the 4-2 victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On Sunday, the Bears took a tough loss from St. Joe's, but 
        rebounded strongly against rival Colby in a 3-2 win. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Poulin led an intense team to victory over the White Mules. 
        Her focus and strength were evident when the game was on the line, and 
        proved too much for Colby to handle. Her record now stands at 9-3.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most recently, the Bears faced Bates. They handed the Bobcats 
        two losses in a doubleheader on Tuesday, pushing the Bates record to a 
        dismal 5-22 (1-5 in NESCAC East competition). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Both of Miller's home runs came in the first matchup of 
        the afternoon. The first rocketed over the center field fence and the 
        second went over in right field. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Miller had been advised to sing the familiar children's 
        tune &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon&quot; to herself while at back. She picked 
        up four RBIs in the game and the Bears won, 6-3. She says, &quot;Go Puff.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the bottom half of the doubleheader against Bates, Hanley 
        again went the distance for the win, bringing her record to 6-3. Miller 
        notched another RBI and Royer knocked in two more with a single in the 
        fourth inning. Bowdoin won the game (which was called in the 6th for darkness) 
        by a score of 7-1.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The advent of Miller's home run hitting, on the heels of 
        the Sheridan knock, elicited a little talk of slugger rivalry among two. 
        However, when asked what she thought of Sheridan's blast, she reported, 
        &quot;I think it's great.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While this was an abnormally short response to a question 
        for Miller, it is assumed that she has the best interests of the team 
        at heart. &quot;I don't think that anybody cares about how they are playing 
        in relation to someone else, I think everybody just tries to do their 
        best,&quot; Rizza chimed in. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having said that, Rizza did suggest that Sheridan &quot;might 
        steal all the extra large helmets and Kristi will have to go up having 
        her head squeezed way too tightly.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Sheridan never confessed to any plans of foul play, 
        she did comment that &quot;Miller's head is too big.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I kind of make her look good, because I'm usually 
        on base when she gets up,&quot; Sheridan continued. &quot;Then she doesn't 
        get solo home runs, she gets multiple RBI home runs, thanks to me. I feel 
        like my getting on base motivates her to get me in.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She went even further. &quot;I think I am partially responsible 
        for her [Miller] getting home runs. I'm actually disappointed that she 
        hasn't said anything to me about it&#133;.But we are a team and I'm going 
        to look beyond that and be the bigger person, metaphorically speaking.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Comments like that assure that this team is indeed all about 
        the big picture rather than individual stats, and unity is obviously a 
        key goal. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think that our team is doing well in coming out 
        with the W's,&quot; Rizza said. &quot;We are doing well and I think that 
        everyone has confidence in their teammates.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These are certainly key factors as the Bears gear up for 
        a tough four-game stretch and head toward a berth in the NESCAC tournament. 
        Bowdoin has two games tomorrow against Trinity and another two on Monday 
        against Colby. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think we have a tendency to make things difficult 
        for ourselves, but I think that we are ready to go into a big weekend 
        with Trinity and take care of Colby right away on Monday,&quot; Sheridan 
        said. &quot;We're ready to take on the powerhouses of NESCAC and come 
        out on top.&quot;</p>
