      <p>A few days ago, a friend of mine was considering taking all government 
        classes next semester. He laughed about it, but has since spent an exorbitant 
        amount of time complaining that he has &quot;nothing&quot; else to take 
        otherwise. <br>
        Then, of course, I have my scientific friends whom you couldn't pay to 
        take an English or philosophy class, or the humanities buffs that would 
        rather eat grass than take a science course.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many people might place me in that last category. But the first thing 
        I do is turn to the science pages when I'm selecting classes. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This has yet, however, to result in my taking a science class. Somehow 
        the notion of taking Bio 105 isn't quite as thrilling as a good number 
        of choices outside the sciences.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite my course selection, I do like science. For the better part of 
        my education, I was set on a scientific track, which I enjoyed, for the 
        most part. I've come to the conclusion, however, that my reluctance to 
        take science classes lies in the fact that virtually all classes offered 
        are applied sciences. Save the few &quot;Physics of the 20th Century&quot; 
        classes, there are no inviting options for those of us who would very 
        much like to make the study of scientific thought an integral part of 
        our education.<br>
        Though there are some limited efforts to cross certain boundaries, it 
        seems to me that most departments and disciplines largely keep to themselves, 
        so that we may never see a class about the history, literature, or philosophy 
        of science. The reason may be that few think there is an interest here, 
        but the few examples I have seen (both here and in high school) of interdisciplinary 
        offerings have been the most successful and enriching components in my 
        education thus far. <br>
        Courses that bring different fields together are a necessary component 
        of education, because nothing in life is so black and white as to be able 
        to fit nicely under the auspices of a &quot;historical problem.&quot; 
        It invariably proves to be a historical problem with political implications, 
        explorations in literature, and possible scientific solutions.<br>
        The idea of a liberal arts education is to be able to explore all fields 
        rather than sticking to one or two, but in many cases, the freedom of 
        a liberal arts education facilitates a student's ignorance of a lot of 
        options that are not necessarily connected to his field of interest. <br>
        Double majoring has been increasing in popularity over the years, which 
        detracts a lot from opportunities to bring ideas together. I'm a culprit 
        of this too-for many of us aspiring to various endeavors, one major simply 
        doesn't seem to be enough of a challenge. <br>
        The problem is that the challenge may very well come at the cost of the 
        liberal arts or &quot;total&quot; education, because it severely limits 
        our possibilities of being exposed to new ideas outside our primary fields 
        of concentration. That result is not a desirable promotion in a premier 
        institution of higher learning. <br>
        The problem rests with students who come into college already having narrowed 
        their minds. It also rests with the makeup of departments that rarely 
        venture out to embrace other departments. This is not to say that professors' 
        interests aren't far-reaching. They are, but because we are not always 
        aware of these interests, it seems just fine to constrain ourselves to 
        a single area-possibly at the price of the humanist notion of education, 
        and certainly at the expense of our duty to be educated about the world 
        in a variety of interacting fields.</p>
