      <p align="left">Many of Julia Butterfly Hill's stories begin: &quot;When 
        I was in the tree&#133;&quot; In her case, the preface means a lot. The 
        environmental activist who spent over two years living near the peak of 
        a California redwood tree told some of those stories at Bowdoin this week 
        as part of Earth Week. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I come by long-windedness naturally,&quot; Hill told 
        an attentive audience in Morrell Lounge Wednesday night. The crowd didn't 
        seem to mind. Earth Week-themed banners were draped all around the Union, 
        Maine environmental groups had set up tables and posters by the mailboxes, 
        and Bowdoin Earth Day t-shirts were selling briskly. People in paint-stained 
        Carhartts and nubby wool sweaters took swigs out of well-worn Nalgene 
        water bottles. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hill's talk was organized by students in a Women's Studies/Environmental 
        Studies class, &quot;Gender, Ecology, and Activism&quot;. Professor Rachel 
        Groner said that arranging the lecture was simple- &quot;We just called 
        her publicist.&quot; Barbara Condliffe '04, who watched Hill's speech 
        from a table as she sold Earth Day t-shirts, said the talk was &quot;great.&quot; 
        The class had been selling the shirts since Friday, she said, but sales 
        picked up the night of Hill's talk. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hill has honed her skills on college audiences, and her 
        talk was practiced, although she spoke casually, without notes, for over 
        an hour. The story of how a business major running a restaurant with her 
        father became a green icon almost overnight is one she must have told 
        over and over. In her account, the environmental bug bit suddenly, during 
        a visit to California redwoods in 1996. &quot;I'd never felt anything 
        like that in my life,&quot; she said, describing how she literally hugged 
        the trees and devoted herself full-time to environmental causes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was in one of those redwoods, nicknamed 'Luna' by the 
        environmental group EarthFirst! whose members pioneered American tree-sitting 
        as a form of protest against logging, that Hill spent two years, from 
        December 1997 to late 1999. Comparing the height of her 4x6 platform above 
        the ground to 'two stories above Coles Tower&quot;, Hill described a life 
        of collecting water from fogs and rain, giving interviews and talks by 
        phone (powered by two solar panels), and exercising by climbing the tree 
        trunk above her several times a day. &quot;I lived in my campaign office,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The tree-sit was motivated, Hill said, by the logging company's 
        callousness toward nearby homeowners whose houses had wiped out by a mudslide 
        from clear-cut land. She described the tactics the company used to get 
        her down from the tree, including constant air horns, close buzzes by 
        helicopters, and trees being felled around her that hit the trunk and 
        shook it- &quot;trying to scare me down or knock me off.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The EarthFirst! organizers had asked Hill to spend five 
        or six days in the tree. After 738 days without touching soil, Hill descended 
        after the lumber company agreed to leave Luna, and trees in a 200-foot 
        radius, alone. &quot;I knew I could continue the activism on the ground,&quot; 
        she said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hill's speaking contract mandates that local environmental 
        groups be allowed to set up booths at her speeches, and several tables 
        set up in Moulton Union sold &quot;enviro pos art&quot; or pushed for 
        protection of Maine lands and waterways. The Maine Green Party was there 
        as well, hoping to register voters.</p>
