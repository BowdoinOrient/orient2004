        With the American Civil War over, the victorious North began to talk about 
        reconstructing the nation. President Andrew Johnson believed and acted 
        as if the Executive branch of the government alone had the power to bring 
        back the Southern states. This, Congress contested. What was even more 
        infuriating to members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, 
        however, was the fact that Johnson's terms of reconciliation were so lenient 
        that former Confederate officials were reelected to positions in the U.S. 
        government. There were no guarantees that the Civil War would not be repeated 
        and Johnson had also cut off any help to the freedmen, who had been so 
        recently liberated by three hundred thousand Northern lives. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Johnson, many radical Republicans believed, needed to go. 
        There was talk of impeachment early on but there had been no real case 
        against the President. William Pitt Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1823, 
        and a veteran of the U.S. Senate, watched in disgust as his colleagues 
        attempted to remove their own president. Fessenden wrote:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The President has undoubtedly been guilty of very serious 
        offenses, the consequences, I think, of bad temper and of self-confidence, 
        the worst consequence of which has been to encourage the South in its 
        opposition to the measures of Congress, and in keeping alive a spirit 
        of hostility. I doubt, however, if he has committed any specific act, 
        which would justify before the world his removal from office.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The origins of the impeachment trial began with the passage 
        of the Tenure of Office Act in March of 1867. The Act, which Johnson vetoed 
        (and Fessenden disapproved of), stated that any federal official, which 
        was appointed with the consent of the Senate could not be removed without 
        the Senate's consent as well. If the Senate was not in session, the President 
        could suspend the official but once the Senate reconvened, and if it did 
        not agree with the suspension, the official had to be returned to his 
        post.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton for the Secretary 
        had opposed Johnson's lenient reconstruction policies from the start. 
        When Congress reconvened that November, Johnson's suspension was overruled 
        by the Senate. Stanton was returned to the War Department. Within a matter 
        of weeks, however, Johnson forced the issue again by dismissing Stanton 
        entirely. On February 24, 1868 the House of Representatives voted 126-47 
        in favor of impeaching the President of the United States.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Everything else that came before Congress, whether it be 
        the issue of bringing the Southern states back into the Union or the issue 
        of black suffrage, was shelved to make way for the case of the century. 
        The prosecution leveled eleven charges against the President, basically 
        accusing him of attempting to violate the Tenure of Office Act and conspiring 
        to hinder the business of the War Department. The trial began on March 
        30, 1868.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few days earlier, Fessenden had written that &quot;The 
        trial will be very dull and stupid work the country will probably be tired 
        and disgusted with it. The result will, in my judgment, be politically 
        disastrous, whatever else may come of it.&quot; Johnson had very few friends 
        and the radical Republicans were moving to cut off the remaining supporters 
        he had. Fessenden, however, was not about to be bullied into a decision 
        that he did not agree with. To one of his sons, he wrote:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We have a tedious job before us in the impeachment, and 
        I regard it with very serious apprehension. I would give much to avoid 
        the responsibility, for it may be that I shall feel compelled to disappoint 
        all the expectations and wishes of our friends. Whatever may be the consequences 
        to myself personally, I will not decide the question against my own judgment.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the trial neared its end in May of 1868, Fessenden let 
        it be known that he would vote for Johnson's acquittal, believing that 
        the President had the right to remove Stanton. To convict Johnson the 
        Senate needed a two-thirds majority. Figuring that the Democrats would 
        vote for Johnson's acquittal, the President's defense needed seven Republican 
        senators to vote &quot;not guilty.&quot; Fessenden and five other Republicans 
        were known to favor letting Johnson go. As the day of judgment moved closer 
        the pressure on those Republican senators to break was extreme. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden himself received a number of threatening letters. 
        One was obvious in its intentions, &quot;Senator Fessenden, - Any Republican 
        senator who votes against impeachment need never expect to get home alive; 
        so take notice&#133;&quot; The letter was signed simply, &quot;a radical.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the pressure from all sides (including from his 
        friends in Washington politics) Fessenden remained firm in his convictions 
        to see justice, as he saw it, done. On May 16, 1868, he sat in his Senate 
        seat along with his colleagues, many of them once friends, now forever 
        his enemies, to render judgment in the case of Andrew Johnson. The Chief 
        Justice of the Supreme Court, Salmon Chase asked for individual verdicts 
        and went down the line. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Mr. Senator Fessenden, how say you? Is the respondent, 
        Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, guilty or not guilty of 
        a high misdemeanor, as charged in this article?&quot; Weathered, worn, 
        embattled, and stubborn till the end, William Pitt Fessenden rose to call 
        out, &quot;Not guilty.&quot;<br>
        The final count was 35-19 in favor of impeachment; one vote shy of the 
        two-thirds majority needed to convict Johnson.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the first Republican to vote &quot;not guilty&quot; many 
        angry radicals singled out Fessenden as a target for their disappointment. 
        When the senator rose to leave after adjournment he remained calm and 
        composed as he walked through a threatening mob. Alone at home, without 
        family or comfort, without the friends he had made in his years as a dedicated 
        Republican, Fessenden collapsed onto his couch and sobbed. The trial finally 
        ended on May 26th with the remaining articles against Johnson falling 
        in the same pattern as the first- not guilty by a narrow margin of one 
        vote.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The trail was over. Within a few months a new Republican 
        president would enter the White House but the Reconstruction process had 
        already been derailed. For William Pitt Fessenden, the trial had cost 
        him his good name, his career in the courts and in the Senate. He would 
        not regain the reputation that he had for within a year and half of Johnson's 
        acquittal, the Maine senator would be dead.<br>
