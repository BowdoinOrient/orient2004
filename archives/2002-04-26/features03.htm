      <p align="left"><font size="5">Economic update: welfare reform<br>
        <font size="2">JOHN FITZGERALD<br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">In his campaign Bill Clinton promised to &quot;end welfare 
        as we know it.&quot; His plans and Republican plans and resulted in the 
        compromise known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 
        Act of 1996, or welfare reform for short. This Act comes up for congressional 
        reauthorization in September of 2002. It has dramatically altered the 
        welfare landscape. Has welfare reform been a success?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are many programs for low income families, including 
        food stamps, energy assistance, housing assistance, and Medicaid and the 
        Earned Income Tax Credit. When we say &quot;welfare&quot; most people 
        are thinking of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, AFDC), 
        the largest cash welfare program, which was renamed the Temporary Aid 
        to Needy Families program (TANF) in the 1996 Act. This program provides 
        cash aid to low income families, largely families headed by unmarried 
        mothers. Married couples are eligible under special circumstances (unemployed 
        or disabled primary earner) but ninety percent of the caseload consists 
        of families headed by unmarried mothers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Welfare reform changed the AFDC system in several ways. 
        First, the program gave greater emphasis to work. The idea of &quot;welfare-to-work&quot; 
        and workfare predates welfare reform and was the main thrust of previous 
        reforms in 1988 that emphasized job training and child care support. But 
        the 1996 law imposed harsher penalties for non-compliance and required 
        work activities (which can include training) for families with young children 
        who were formerly exempt. (One state requires work when the youngest child 
        reaches the age of 12 weeks.) Second, the responsibility for the program 
        was devolved to states. States were allowed greater latitude in making 
        rules and the funding was provided in a block grant to states instead 
        of by a matching formula. </p>
      <p align="left">A consequence is that welfare is no longer an entitlement. 
        Under AFDC, a family was guaranteed to receive benefits (entitled) as 
        long as they were eligible. Under TANF, there is no such guarantee; a 
        state may discontinue benefits if it spends all of its block grant. Third, 
        states must impose a five-year lifetime limit on benefits for a person. 
        States can exempt up to twenty percent of their caseload from this limit. 
        The time limit is the most controversial component. We are just now seeing 
        the first cohort of recipients come up to the time limit and it is not 
        yet clear how states will respond. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To decide whether the reforms are a success, we first have 
        to define success. Does success mean greater well-being of recipients 
        or does it mean reduced cost of the program? Since 1996, the welfare caseload 
        has fallen dramatically. The proportion of recipients who work has risen 
        and many of those leaving welfare did so by increasing their earnings. 
        By this measure, the reform was a success. Since the economy was booming 
        during this time period, however, many recipients would have left welfare 
        without the welfare rule changes. There is debate about the proportion 
        of the caseload drop that is due to the good economy and to welfare reform, 
        with estimates indicating a substantial part due the economy. For example, 
        the caseload began to drop in 1994, two years prior to the 1996 reforms. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is little debate that the combination of greater work 
        requirements and greater work opportunity had a larger impact than either 
        separately. A recession will make it much more difficult for recipients 
        to move off the program.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">How did welfare reform affect the well-being of the poor? 
        Some argue that simply by forcing recipients into the job market, one 
        raises their job experience and in ways that will pay off in the future 
        and raise their self-esteem and well being. The evidence to date paints 
        a less rosy picture. </p>
      <p align="left">Recipients who left welfare by taking a job have incomes 
        roughly similar to the low incomes that they had while on welfare. Recipients 
        are low wage workers. Further, there is little evidence to date of wage 
        growth among this group. Moreover, working recipients have higher child 
        care and work expenses than before, even though child-care is subsidized 
        to a greater degree under TANF. Ongoing studies are assessing the impact 
        on welfare children with preliminary results showing detrimental effects 
        of the reforms. </p>
      <p align="left">In short, based on current evidence, while reform was successful 
        at reducing caseloads, it did not improve the well-being of recipients. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From a political point of view, the focus on work is here 
        to stay. The reauthorization should improve the program by eliminating 
        the five year lifetime limit to add greater flexibility in times of economic 
        downturn, as well as limit some of the harsher work requirements. Further, 
        greater support for work through child-care subsidy and wage subsidy would 
        help. George Bush's latest welfare plan calls for even more work requirements, 
        yet cuts grants for housing and child care for workers leaving welfare. 
        Governors and welfare directors in 39 states have come out against these 
        proposals. If Bush wants us to believe he is a &quot;compassionate conservative,&quot; 
        he should show some compassion on this issue.</p>
