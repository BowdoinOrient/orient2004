      <p>After several years of planning and months of construction, the new Outdoor 
        Leadership Center (OLC), home to the Bowdoin Outing Club, is expected 
        to open in June. <br>

      </table>
      <p>Several environmentally-friendly features have been incorporated into 
        its design and construction process, although a number of features were 
        eliminated due to financial cutbacks. It is hoped, though, that the experience 
        with this building process will be useful in setting goals for future 
        project designs on campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The architect for the OLC, Richard Renner from Van Dam &amp; Renner, 
        said that the strongest environmental aspects of Bowdoin's newest building 
        are site use, lack of air conditioning, natural ventilation, use of day 
        lighting, and radiant-floor heating. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The original design for the OLC called for 15,000 to 18,000 square feet 
        but was cut down to a little over 5000 square feet. As Renner said, &quot;The 
        greenest thing is what you don't build!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The site was also chosen very carefully to preserve trees and the natural 
        surroundings by constructing the building close to the road and over an 
        old faculty parking lot. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Radiant-floor heating will offer energy savings as well as improved indoor 
        air quality. It works by turning the floor into a large-area, low-temperature 
        radiator. The high windows and the heat-exchange ventilation system, in 
        which the warm air inside the building helps to heat the cold air as it 
        enters, are also energy-efficient designs that will help to reduce heat 
        loss. <br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most sustainable materials being used in the building is Trex, 
        a recycled plastic that replaces lumber normally used for decks. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The building also receives the highest rating in the Leadership in Energy 
        and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system for having over 90 percent 
        of the building's interior spaces lit by daylight. The kitchen, offices, 
        meeting rooms, and storerooms will have little need for artificial lighting, 
        which will assist in reducing the amount of energy used in the building. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The United States Green Building Council has developed LEED to guide 
        designers and contractors through the &quot;green building&quot; process, 
        which has three major goals: (1) to minimize energy use and maximize longevity, 
        (2) to preserve the natural site and ecosystem, and (3) to reduce the 
        overall impact by using recycled and low impact materials. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Over the past three years, approximately thirty universities and colleges 
        around the country, including Emory, Mount Holyoke, Cornell, MIT, Oberlin 
        and Swarthmore, have registered new campus buildings as LEED certified. 
        Dartmouth requires that all new buildings be LEED certified. <br>
        While green building can have higher up-front costs when compared to &quot;non-green&quot; 
        projects, the operating costs associated with the building remain significantly 
        lower throughout the building's life span. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although Bowdoin has yet to use the LEED rating system in the building 
        process, the College has made vast improvements in becoming a more sustainable 
        campus in recent years. Some of these modifications include: <br>
        -Installation of fluorescent light bulbs<br>
        -Continual replacement of exit signs with LEDs (light-emitting diodes)<br>
        -Motion sensors in selective bathrooms and libraries<br>
        -Recycling stations in dorms and throughout buildings<br>
        -Sensitivity to building placement<br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the greatest impacts that humans have on the earth is construction, 
        maintenance, and occupancy of space. The environmental impacts of buildings, 
        as listed by the U.S. Green Building Council, include:<br>
        -65.2% of U.S. electricity consumption<br>
        -greater than 36% of total U.S. primary energy use<br>
        -30% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions<br>
        -136 million tons of construction and demolition waste in the U.S.<br>
        -12% of potable water in the U.S.<br>
        -40% of raw materials used globally</p>
