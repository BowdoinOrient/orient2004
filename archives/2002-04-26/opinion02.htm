        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>sex&middot;ile: n. a ban on entering one's own dorm room 
        because one's roommate is engaging in sexual activity.</i></p>
      <p>William Shakespeare may have invented much of the English language, but 
        we must not forget to give some credit to college campuses, where words 
        such as the one above originated. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sexile is a common occurrence. I have confidence that every Bowdoin student, 
        at some point in his or her college career, will be sexiled. It can happen 
        when boyfriends or girlfriends visit or when a roommate hooks up. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Everyone has a story to tell about being sexiled or sexiling his or her 
        roommate. Ramona once wrote in permanent marker on her door: &quot;Don't 
        come in. Love, Ramona.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Charlotte recalls being sexiled for three whole days and nights when 
        her freshman-year roommate's boyfriend came to visit. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Stewart used to move his bookcase in front of the door so it couldn't 
        be opened from the inside. If Chris brought a girl home before his roommate 
        came back, he would tie a bandanna around the doorknob (subtlety is not 
        always the first priority in these matters).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, there is always the option of not sexiling. Monica awoke in 
        the middle of the night a few weekends ago to the sounds of her bunk bed 
        creaking. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Eve remembers waking up the other morning, looking across the room in 
        a sleepy wonderment, and whispering to her roommate, &quot;Who is that?&quot; 
        <br>
        &quot;Oh, this is John,&quot; her roommate replied. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, Eve is a good-natured girl. She smiled and went back to sleep. 
        <br>
        Some of us are not so inclined. Last weekend, Sarah was very tired and 
        walked into her room only to encounter her roommate, Meg, and Meg's boyfriend 
        in a very, shall we say, intimate arrangement. She immediately began yelling 
        at Meg about how the two of them share a room and she couldn't believe 
        Meg's lack of consideration. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Needless to say, the night was ruined for Sarah, Meg, and Meg's boyfriend. 
        Such unpleasantness is wholly unnecessary.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After much research and personal experience, I have learned much about 
        what is and is not acceptable in the act of sexiling. I present you with 
        the first ever BOWDOIN HANDBOOK ON SEXILE ETIQUETTE:</p>
      <p><b>Sexiler</b> <br>
        -DO remember that you share a room and you are seriously inconveniencing 
        your roommate(s) in your actions<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO remember that your roommate(s) will, either that night or the next 
        morning, need to get back in their room for clothes, books, toothbrush, 
        shower gear, etc. <br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO NOT sexile your roommate(s) for multiple days and/or nights in a 
        row. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO make it as obvious as possible to your roommate(s) that the room 
        is occupied. Don't worry about embarassing yourself in front of your hookup-if 
        he or she wants it that badly, they can wait a minute while you lock the 
        door and write a note...(preferably not Ramona-style). Consider investing 
        in an always-handy dry-erase board-you'll thank yourself later.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO NOT rule out your common room as a sleeping option-either for yourself 
        or for your roommate(s). Consider investing in a futon or large, comfortable 
        sofa; Bowdoin-issued furniture often does not cut it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO NOT make lots of noise or move around too much, especially in a bunk 
        bed-that is, if you decide not to sexile your roommate(s). Consideration 
        is absolutely a must.</p>
      <p><b>Sexiled</b><br>
        -DO talk to your roommate(s) and agree on a method of indicating that 
        the room is occupied.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO stick to your agreement, and DO NOT barge in when the bandanna is 
        around the door.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO knock, announce your arrival, and fumble with the lock before entering 
        a room where you believe people may be hooking up.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO talk to your roommate(s) if they are sexiling you too often. Suggest 
        that couples alternate nights in each other's room.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-DO remember that you may have to be in a room where two people are sharing 
        a bed-this is a fact of college life, and you will have to get used to 
        it. If you find that you have serious moral or religious issues with this, 
        talk to your roommate(s) very early on. If it continues to be a problem, 
        you can consider transferring to a single.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bottom Line: Don't be selfish. Remember that you're sharing a room, and 
        do unto your roommate(s) as you would have your roommate(s) do unto you.
