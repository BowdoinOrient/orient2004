        COLUMNIST</font></font><br>
        <br>
        On my visit to FDR's home at Hyde Park, made to impress the &quot;good 
        guys&quot; at the CIA, I thought I was being &quot;shadowed&quot; by a 
        man I took to be a psychiatrist, charged with &quot;assessing&quot; his 
        assigned subject as to its sanity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That's how far I was gone. It never occurred to me that 
        in order for this to be so, they would have had to know in advance that 
        I was going to make this trip, and to have read my mind as to its purpose. 
        That is how someone's mind works who due to paranoid symptoms aggravated 
        by megalomaniac delusions has moments when he thinks he's at the center 
        of a &quot;spy case&quot; with political ramifications. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In such moments I really thought the time had come for me 
        to &quot;come out of the cold&quot; and give the &quot;good guys&quot; 
        some signal that I was about to do so. <br>
        It was the same sick frame of mind that made me suspect that nice Ursula, 
        my personal assistant at A.K. Peters Company, was &quot;in the pay&quot; 
        of the FBI (and to make a play for her in order to convince them that 
        I didn't suspect this). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Such delusions at times took on an amusing character. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When going to lunch one day, I noticed a Mercedes limousine 
        parked outside the entrance of the Pan-Am building, with a uniformed chauffeur 
        waiting by the open door, presumably for the executive of some company 
        with offices in the building, in an obsequious attitude. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I was so far gone as to imagine in a moment of vainglorious 
        delusion that in reality he was waiting for me, and that if I dared step 
        into the waiting car I would be driven straight to CIA headquarters at 
        Langley, Virginia. <br>
        Thank God I didn't, for I'd probably have been taken straight to the &quot;loony 
        bin&quot; at Bellevue Hospital instead. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, a few weeks later I did something almost equally 
        as stupid. Having convinced myself that the time for coming in out of 
        the cold wasn't ripe yet, I threw up my job to head for the wintry hills 
        of Vermont where my Bowdoin Big Brother Bill Beckett was living. Married 
        with one son, Bill was teaching philosophy at the University of Vermont 
        in Burlington. Though willing to put his Little Brother up for a few days, 
        he suggested I get a job, if intending to stay, and to try and find living 
        quarters locally. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bill even arranged for an interview with the head of the 
        German department, but the fellow must have been puzzled by my slightly 
        strange behaviour, probably due to my feeling that he too perhaps wasn't 
        entirely to be trusted. In any case, though subsequently to do so on several 
        occasions, I have always intensely disliked teaching my native language. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Finally a temporary job was found for me answering telephones 
        in the University Hospital's ambulance department, with a battery of them 
        ringing all at once most of the time, a job that would have driven me 
        crazy, if I hadn't been (just a little) already. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In this hellish job I lasted exactly two weeks, before throwing 
        it up too. In the evenings I would hang out in the student union, &quot;observing&quot; 
        people and making notes, or writing letters, among others to Bill Whiteside, 
        my former history professor at Bowdoin, trying to enlist his help. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Weekends I would spend with Bill and Nancy, increasingly 
        worried by my strange behaviour, yet unable to offer any help beyond gentle 
        suggestions as to perhaps consulting a doctor. This I actually consented 
        to do, but must have worried him too when attributing noises in the radiators 
        in my rented room, causing me sleeplessness, to &quot;machinations&quot; 
        by the FBI. Fortunately the time wasn't far off when my paternal friend 
        the British Colonel was due to meet me in Boston, on his way back to England 
        from a stay for his health's sake in Arizona. Everything now, I was convinced, 
        depended on &quot;Uncle Jack.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So I bid Bill and Nancy goodbye, telling them I had booked 
        on the same flight to London witH the Colonel and his wife. Little did 
        I know I would not be returning to my quasi-adopted country for more than 
        thirty years; until last September, in fact, for a two-week trip through 
        New England culminating with a memorable visit to Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Colonel's son, studying at Fletcher school of Diplomacy 
        (and currently UK Ambassador in Jakarta), arranged for me to have a long 
        chat with his Dad in the comfort and security of Boston's University Club, 
        while he took his Mom to see A Man for All Seasons, a film about Thomas 
        More, with Paul Schofield.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When I'd finished my long and involved tale of &quot;surveillance&quot; 
        by the FBI, and my cat-and-mouse game in order to make them think I was 
        really an important &quot;case,&quot; and thus possibly a &quot;factor&quot; 
        in the past presidential campaign, Jack turned to me and said, with an 
        air of admiration tinged with disbelief, &quot;Well, Ludy, I suppose you're 
        a public figure now.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But the minute he said that I knew it wasn't true.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next day at Logan Airport I boarded the same plane as he 
        and his wife, only that Jack and Barbara sat in First Class, I in Tourist. 
        During the long flight back to London he would now and then come back 
        to talk to me.<br>
        On arrival at Heathrow, however, I was shocked to see my paternal friend, 
        tall and slim still, being taken off the plane in a wheelchair. It was 
        the last time I saw Jack, who was to die of a heart attack suffered in 
        his sleep four weeks later.</p>
