        Nigel Poor began her lecture entitled &quot;8 Words&quot; with a quotation 
        by Ambrose Bierce that defined a day as &quot;a period of 24 hours, mostly 
        misspent.&quot; Poor was quick to say that it is each person's duty to 
        prove this statement wrong.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although some of her students might say that Poor is &quot;obsessed 
        with death,&quot; she asserts that she is &quot;really obsessed with time.&quot; 
        It is this obsession that has driven her to try to capture, by means of 
        photography, the passage of time and its effects on the living world. 
        The result has been beauty in its most simple and pure forms-found in 
        objects that one might never bother to glance at twice, if at all. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Poor's hands a scattering of dirt particles is transformed 
        into the night sky dusted with stars; the hair that one might find in 
        the drain becomes a delicate thing of splendor and grace on a white page. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the scholar-in-residence, Poor spent the spring semester 
        on site at the Bowdoin Coastal Studies Center. Besides working on her 
        own artistic experiments and works in progress while on the island, Poor 
        also taught a course entitled &quot;Observation to Obsession: An Exploration 
        of Looking&quot; (Art 185). The course is primarily concerned with &quot;an 
        exploration of every day life and how, with careful observation, extraordinary 
        things can happen.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Her lecture centered on the projects that she has been engaged 
        in while residing at the Bowdoin Coastal Studies Center. These projects 
        included a range of themes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For the first project, which was based upon collections 
        of dead flies and ladybugs, Poor created photograms-i.e. contact prints. 
        These are made by placing something opaque or translucent on light sensitive 
        material and then exposing it to light. This blocks out part of the light 
        and the result is an outline of the object.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">By placing the carcasses on the light sensitive paper and 
        then, frame by frame, reducing the dead insects to dust, Poor was able 
        to create beauty out of something that might normally be considered disgusting.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another project entitled &quot;Evidence of Thought&quot; 
        involved a wide range of people choosing three objects that described 
        themselves. Yet another project in progress, non-photographic in style, 
        is entitled &quot;Tiny Writing.&quot; The intent of this project, said 
        Poor, is to &quot;prove that we can't get rid of the actions in our lives-we 
        can say the action didn't happen, but we can's take the emotional response 
        to action away.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To convey this, Poor set up three sheets: the first on which 
        she wrote the action, the second contained the thoughts that correspond 
        to the actions, and the emotions that accompany the actions were recorded 
        on the third sheet. The result was three blocks of tiny writing, the actions 
        compiling the smallest block and the emotion compiling the largest block 
        of writing.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final piece that Poor presented was entitled &quot;The 
        Lint Piece.&quot; In order to &quot;show the passage of time,&quot; Poor 
        collected pieces of lint resulting from the washing of clothes. By tracking 
        this seemingly mundane activity through the medium of photography, Poor 
        was able to create something amazingly graceful.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nigel Poor earned her bachelor's degree in photography and 
        literature from Bennington College, and her master of fine arts degree 
        in photography from the Massachusetts College of Art.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Poor's lecture was held at the Visual Arts Center at 7:00 
        p.m. on Wednesday April 24.</p>
