      <p><font size="5">Re-evaluating the social houses</font></p>
      <p>As the social house system enters a phase that seems something like dormancy, 
        it becomes all the more important to think about what the system is and 
        what it should be, as the Inter-House Council and house leaders plan to 
        do.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The pervasiveness of the social house system is one of those myths of 
        Bowdoin College life. Prospective students read in the Viewbook that Bowdoin's 
        residential life &quot;centers around&quot; the house system. Many students, 
        consequently, expect great things of the house system-they want it, perhaps, 
        to foster a vibrance in the campus that just may not exist here. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Current and past house residents deserve a great deal of credit for trying 
        to put together a meaningful system for a campus that is not particularly 
        receptive to their efforts. That much of the campus doesn't bother with 
        the social houses is not a slam on either house leaders or on disinterested 
        non-affiliates. The system, as it is, seems to work consistently only 
        to satisfy the small number of people who live in the houses. And this 
        is not necessarily a bad thing: if the majority of the campus does not 
        have an interest in taking part in the houses, the system does not have 
        to be called a failure for it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Success, however, can hardly be defined as having as much as 70 percent 
        of non-house members living in a house. It is also probably true that 
        the successes of the system (it has its merits, and some well-attended 
        events) do not correlate with the vast resources and effort put into it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The system might die altogether in a few years, perhaps owing to the 
        fact that it doesn't work for college administrators or a mission statement 
        to engineer students' social lives. If students are happy with whatever 
        alternative, then its death would be no real tragedy. The system might 
        also enjoy a quieter success (such as it has already) without it being 
        the publicized, &quot;centralized&quot; thing that some people want it 
        to be in theory. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On the one hand, it is extremely important that the house system be reevaluated, 
        and that this reevaluation be taken seriously by trustees and administrators. 
        So much effort and so many resources go into the houses that it is a shame 
        to see them so dead. On the other hand, it might not matter all that much, 
        since for many Bowdoin students, the houses hardly exist in the first 
        place.-NJL</p>
      <p align="left"><font size="5">Abercrombie &amp; Moron</font></p>
      <p>Abercrombie and Fitch pulled T-shirts from its stores last week, due 
        largely to the protests of students at Stanford University. In question 
        was the artwork of a particular T-shirt, which depicted two Asian men 
        dressed in a grotesquely stereotypical fashion. The slogan of the shirt 
        read &quot;Wong Brothers Laundry Service: Two Wongs Can Make It White.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The infuriating aspect of Abercrombie and Fitch's lack of consideration 
        for an ethnic group is only rivaled by its overwhelming lack of common 
        sense. It is frightening to think that the company expected American college 
        students-its target consumer group-to pay for this attire. We as college 
        students are privy to an elite world of mental exercise and activism, 
        and this was exemplified by the immediate and effective reactions of Stanford 
        students. </p>
      <p>Abercrombie and Fitch's production of these shirts suggests that its 
        level of intelligence is dwarfed by the mental capacity and sensibility 
        of its target audience. -DJM</p>
