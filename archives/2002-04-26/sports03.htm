      <p>It seems to be a pattern: for the last three years, the annual Colby-Bates-Bowdoin 
        President's Cup has been cold, windy, and spirited. In a tough day of 
        competition last Sunday, the Bowdoin Navy took on crews from Colby and 
        Bates in a fierce rowing competition. The water was choppy, the wind was 
        howling, and the crews were fired up.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the first race of the day, Bowdoin's novice women rowed past Colby 
        to claim first place and remain undefeated on the season. When asked about 
        the conditions, first year Eliza Lende said it was a tough and very tiring 
        race. Lende and the rest of the novice women had little time to catch 
        their breath before they hopped into a varsity eights race, joining their 
        own varsity women in a boat borrowed from Colby. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin women, in a heavyweight men's shell and with only one practice 
        under their belts as an eight, rowed a tough race against Colby and Bates 
        (teams that compete in eights on a regular basis). They showed determination 
        and courage, and claimed that they learned a lot in their first outing 
        in a bigger boat. Sophomore Katie Chandler said after the race, &quot;The 
        water was horrible, and I really didn't want to go out again&#133;but 
        at least we knew how to row it better after that!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>In an exciting and somewhat redemptive race, Bowdoin's first varsity 
        women claimed a finish-line victory over Colby by less than three seconds. 
        The boat, stroked by sophomore Sadie Anderson, remained undefeated for 
        the season. Coxswain Katie Smith '03 is looking forward to this weekend's 
        New England Fours Championship, where her rowers will face their rivals 
        from the University of Vermont for the third time this season.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin's second women rowed a clean race in the same varsity fours event. 
        Though they are known as the &quot;mini-mites&quot; of the crew team (none 
        of the four stand above 5'4&quot;), they displayed good composure in racing 
        girls nearly six feet tall. The boat consists of five sophomores including 
        coxswain Lauren Sarno and Mara Partridge, a transfer from the Georgetown 
        crew. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The men's side of the regatta was equally exciting. First-year coxswain 
        Ben Needham's boat remained undefeated and beat out other crews with ease 
        in the varsity men's heavyweight fours event. Rowing became a contact 
        sport when Bowdoin's second men, forced out of their lane, banged oars 
        with Bates. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The tangled mess allowed Bowdoin's third men to power by and finish a 
        strong and somewhat surprising second place. All three varsity men's boats 
        are looking ahead to the New England Fours Championships, where they are 
        planning to rack up plenty of points with their depth. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The varsity eight rounded out the men's competition-a crew made up of 
        Bowdoin's top eight male rowers. Though they had only practiced together 
        a few times, they rowed well as a group and claimed second place in a 
        hard-earned finish behind the experienced Colby eight. Coach Gil Birney 
        said, &quot;After a slow start, the men battled back into it, shocking 
        Colby and Bates, and the three crews rowed even into the rough water of 
        the last 500 meters.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>He was so excited by this performance that he gave his men the go-ahead 
        to race the eight at New England Championships&#133;and he likes their 
        chances for success.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Up next on the radar screen for the Bowdoin Navy is the New England Fours 
        Championships tomorrow, in Lowell, Massachusetts. The Bowdoin rowers have 
        claimed the team trophy for two years running and are looking eagerly 
        for a three-peat. </p>
