      <p> Every year, when Hollywood evaluates its production bin, figuring out 
        what to remember and what to forget, the out pile is consistently bigger 
        than the in pile. There have always been more misses than hits in moviemaking-some 
        seriously tried to be good but couldn't make it, some gave half-hearted 
        attempts, and some didn't even care and had a better time hanging out 
        in the out bin anyway.<br>

      <p>But I always had a soft spot for those movies-and there a few of them-that 
        make fun of themselves as they go along. I don't mean parodies, like <i>Scary 
        Movie</i>, but movies that stick to their genre, expose how very artificial 
        the formulas are, and make viewers laugh even harder at the realization. 
        This is why I enjoyed <i>The Sweetest Thing</i>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Coming into screen 6, I was sure that I was seeing a straight-up chick 
        flick with all the romantic gook and sentimental overture. I didn't expect 
        to see a couple get very disgustingly stuck due to a piercing (use your 
        imagination), or a roomful of random people in a house burst into Aerosmith's 
        &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thing,&quot; or for the two leading best 
        friends to step out of the dressing room and say, &quot;Is there time 
        for a movie montage?&quot; step back in, and partake in one of the genre's 
        characteristic must-have sequences.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The film tells the classic chick-flick story of a girl who's gotta learn 
        to commit. Christina (Cameron Diaz) meets Peter (Thomas Jane) at a club 
        and for some reason can't forget about him. So she and her best friend 
        Courtney (Christina Applegate) decide on a whim to go to his brother's 
        wedding-which actually turns out to be his wedding. But at the last minute 
        Peter and his fianc&eacute;e conveniently break up (or we wouldn't have 
        a movie, now would we?). Then it's just a matter of clearing up the misunderstanding 
        and getting the two together.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The redemption of this movie's very, very icky direction (what can you 
        expect from a director named Roger Kumble whose other work includes <i>Cruel 
        Intentions</i>) is its humor. Ranging from Cameron's ditzy gestures to 
        overplayed jokes in the style of <i>American Pie</i>, you'll be laughing 
        from start to finish, even if you think (and you'd be right) that the 
        plot is crap. It's almost like the actors all know that what they're doing 
        doesn't make sense, so they intentionally liven up the funny moments so 
        you'll forget-and oftentimes you do. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Acting is obviously not going to be a factor in this film. Cameron is 
        slightly less ditzy than she was in <i>There's Something About Mary</i>, 
        but just as appealing, and Christina Applegate shows promise in moviemaking, 
        coming off a career in TV shows like <i>Married&#133;With Children</i> 
        and <i>Jessie</i>. Tom Jane, despite his girly name, is quite gorgeous; 
        look for him in the next few girly film products.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Don't come to <i>The Sweetest Thing</i> expecting anything grand, but 
        just have a good time. Lavish in the stupidity and self-mockery. You won't 
        walk out enlightened, but hey, it's Ivies Weekend-there's no room for 
        that anyway.</p>
