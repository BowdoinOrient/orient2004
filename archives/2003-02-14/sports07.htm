        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">If Meg Greenleaf had the chance to live her dream life, 
        what ambitious tasks would she undertake? While others may try to end 
        world hunger or travel around the world by sail boat, Meg simply answered, 
        &quot;I'd do the three things I love-eat, sleep, and ski.&quot; </p>
      <p>Such an answer seemed reasonable for the senior captain of the Bowdoin 
        Nordic Ski Team. Greenleaf, who has been skiing practically since the 
        moment she left the womb, has always loved skiing, snow, and spandex race 
        suits. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I use to watch my older sister race and I loved her ski suit! It 
        looked so cool!&quot; Obviously this led her down the path to becoming 
        one of Bowdoin's finest ski racers. I had the opportunity to sit with 
        Greenleaf and see what makes her so passionate about such a tough sport.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>Orient</i>: Meg, what does skiing mean to you?<br>
        <i>Greenleaf</i>: Well, I would say skiing has saved me at Bowdoin. It 
        is my way of release after a long day and school work. I get out there 
        in the afternoon and relax during a long ski or even during a tough workout. 
        It lets me veg out. </p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> Has this feeling always been the case or have you seen 
        progressive changes in your four years here? <br>
        <i>G:</i> I have grown into a more competitive and focused racer over the four 
        years. At first I didn't care if I was racing or not, but ever since Marty 
        Hall entered into the program as head coach, he has taught me a lot more 
        what it means to race. He is arguably the best coach in North America. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Racing has become important to me, and I look forward to it each weekend. 
        I love that I am serious enough about it now and all the great feelings 
        of accomplishment and relaxation I get from it.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> From all the fun you have, what most memorable moment 
        could you share in this interview?<br>
        <i>G:</i> There are lots of memorable moments; I don't know where to begin. But 
        they are bit complicated to explain-I'm not sure if it would make sense 
        to most people.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> Like you mean the term &quot;jacked biscuits.&quot;<br>
        <i>G:</i> Exactly. That is a term that started with a skier before my time and 
        has stuck around. It is a saying that us skiers just pass around and because 
        skiing here is a small community, if someone gets it then you know he 
        or she is a skier.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> How do you feel being on such a small team? <br>
        <i>G:</i> Well, it's like being with your brothers and sisters-you are close, 
        but you can get a little too close to a breaking point. But I think that 
        away from that, the team is great in that you are with a group of people 
        who understand the sport. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They put in the time and commitment because they love it. They know what 
        it feels like after a tough classic day or the meaning of the word &quot;biscut.&quot; 
        But it is tough to talk about to people who aren't skiers because the 
        sport is misunderstood to most people. There is a different culture surrounding 
        recreational skiing and ski racing.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> Does it bother you that nordic skiing is misunderstood 
        by many people?<br>
        <i>G:</i> The only thing I get a little annoyed with is when I come back from 
        a race and a person asks, &quot;Did you win?&quot; Skiing and racing, 
        in my mind, is a test. I see how far I can push myself. </p>
      <p align="left"> <i>O:</i> So do you think the end of this season will be the end 
        of your skiing career?<br>
        <i>G:</i> Definitely not-it's in my blood. I love it. I can't stop.</p>
