      <p align="left">&quot;Love Stinks,&quot; said The J. Geils Band, and all 
        the indignant single people agreed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In celebration of Valentine's Day I was going to write about the phenomenon 
        of love; the subject that, in some form or another, infiltrates the majority 
        of the songs we have learned to call rock and roll. Then I realized that 
        love is something less like a phenomenon and more like a myth here at 
        our frozen little slice of society otherwise known as Bowdoin College. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the true bitterness that only an unattached Bowdoin student can understand, 
        I decided that a list of songs for an anti-Valentine's Day would reach 
        a lot more people here. So if you are particularly bitter this Valentine's 
        Day, you can have a girls' or guys' night out and forget the whole idea 
        of dating and pour your emotions out to a bowl of ice cream (or a six 
        pack of beer).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Or you can take the less pathetic route and crank your stereo and dance 
        like &quot;Mr. or Ms. I'll-call-you-tomorrow&quot; only wishes they could 
        move. Your stereo is a much more reliable date anyway: it doesn't forget 
        to call, it says whatever you want it to say, if it pisses you off you 
        just shut it off, and to top it off, it gives you your own personal serenade 
        everyday-what date does that? So, if you're one of the many having a date 
        with your CD collection this V Day, here are some songs to listen to for 
        an Anti-Valentine's Day hit list:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Velvet Underground's &quot;The Gift&quot;-if Waldo wasn't so thick he 
        would have realized that Marsha was not being as faithful as he. So if 
        he is going to be so stupid as to actually mail himself for someone who 
        doesn't even love him, then he is probably better getting his skull chopped 
        in two. Isn't a cracked cranium less painful than a broken heart?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Garth Brooks &quot;Two Pi&ntilde;a Coladas&quot;-much to my surprise, 
        there are a few pop-country fans at this school. Although they may be 
        in the minority, everyone needs an anti-Valentine theme of their own-no 
        roses and champagne here. Chase this with &quot;Why Don't We Get Drunk,&quot; 
        by Jimmy Buffet. Happiness for middle aged white men reached through alcohol 
        and a lack of romanticism-ahh, how encouraging.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Guns n' Roses &quot;I Used to Love Her&quot;-I can't say that GNR are 
        the most politically correct boys ever to grace the airwaves, but they 
        do release some of that relationship angst. Listen to Axl; it's okay to 
        despise an ex.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Violent Femmes' &quot;Blister in the Sun&quot;-We all know what this song 
        is really about, and it sure isn't love in the sense of being a couple. 
        Single-handed fun is what it's all about here.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Yeah Yeah Yeahs' &quot;Bang&quot;-New York's female fronted trio sings 
        about needing the real thing tonight, and something tells me that she 
        isn't talking about dinner and a movie. Forget what you've read-according 
        the leading lady Karen O, &quot;the bigger, the better.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While heated love songs might be fitting for your one-on-one Saturday 
        night party, come Sunday morning you'll be back to the single-hood that 
        has plagued you since your last relationship (read: last hook up). Think 
        about it, do you really want to celebrate a holiday that only exists so 
        Hallmark can stay in business? No. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Are you allowed to be bitter that people expect you to gush and buy chocolate? 
        Yes. Hopefully these songs will help for a Valentine's Day that, even 
        though not filled with romantic courtship, is full of much less stressful 
        indulgences. Besides, love sounds a whole lot better when it's coming 
        out of your speakers in heavy distortion.</p>
