        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> My desk on the third floor of Hawthorne-Longfellow Library 
        rests across from the bookshelf that houses every Bowdoin Bugle, our yearbook, 
        since the late 1860s. I enjoy taking study breaks to peruse these repositories 
        of school history. They not only show timeless images of the quad, but 
        also changes in American culture through differences in pictures, formats, 
        and emphases. The contrast is especially vivid between World War II and 
        the Vietnam War era. These periods compel me because they represent spirits 
        of unity, activism, and division-sentiments that seem absent on this campus 
        today as our country rests on the brink of war. </p>
      <p>Nearly every yearbook has an introductory message from the editors. The 
        most powerful in my opinion is the message from 1944. It snatches the 
        reader into the severity and gravity of World War II on a hauntingly moving 
        first page. The editors place a picture of Hubbard Hall with the flagpole 
        in a prominent position and the flag itself waving proudly in the front 
        of the picture. A tense but resolute message compounds the visual patriotism: 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;In a nation mobilized and geared for total war, the primary function 
        of any institution of higher learning must be to train specialists and 
        technicians&#133;Here, then, is a chronicle of Bowdoin in what may be 
        its last year as a liberal arts college&#133;Seldom, if ever, has there 
        been more uncertainty about the future. In the following pages, however, 
        we have portrayed Bowdoin as it was during the first semester of 1942-1943. 
        The Bowdoin we shall always remember.&quot; </p>
      <p>This prose shows that the men who compiled this yearbook attempted to 
        portray a somewhat normal existence while being frighteningly aware that 
        not only their College, but also that their country might no longer exist 
        as they had always known it. The book became their time capsule, what 
        they would leave behind to an unknown world as a testament both of their 
        dear College and perhaps of themselves as they were called to war. </p>
      <p>The Vietnam War was of course much more divisive in the country as a 
        whole than World War II. Thus, it is not surprising that the Vietnam era 
        yearbooks are completely different than their early 1940s counterparts. 
        The 1969 Bugle has pictures of insouciant frolicking. There is also the 
        stark political image of a burned draft card demonstrating the animosity 
        toward the Vietnam War that was common in that era. </p>
      <p>Also, some of the yearbooks in this period are self-deprecating. The 
        best example of this is the 1972 yearbook. It begins with many pictures 
        of bare trees and swamps. There are also a number of pictures of local 
        elderly people that look like they came from a book of George Tice photography. 
        It is as if the editors of the book are attempting to elicit guilt for 
        our &quot;privileged position.&quot; </p>
      <p>The editors also left no writing in the entire book. I find this decision 
        troubling. It gives curious students like me little guidance in discerning 
        what motivations these students had in designing their yearbook as they 
        did. <br>
        We can learn much about the Zeitgeist of both the school and the broader 
        world by looking at the pictures and words of a yearbook. Though perhaps 
        the silence of the book and the untraditional photographs are the cultural 
        messages, it is still disappointing to view the 1972 Bugle as a student 
        thirty years later and read neither a call to arms nor a call to resistance. 
      </p>
      <p>Today, Hans Blix speaks to the United Nations. His words will help influence 
        President Bush's decision to go to war. Yet there is little sign on campus 
        that our country is on the brink of war. Let us hope that the editors 
        of this year's yearbook leave an indication in photographs and words that 
        there was serious talk of war, and our legacy was apathy. <br>
