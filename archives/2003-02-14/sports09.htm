        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">As a Valentine's Day tribute, I present to you, the reader, 
        what I would truly love to watch happen in the world of sports. For such 
        a special occasion, a top ten list is in order.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #10-Content with his 800 victories in the college ranks, head coach Bobby 
        Knight heads to the NBA as an assistant to Phil Jackson with the Los Angeles 
        Lakers. After a lackluster performance by Shaquille O'Neal, Knight picks 
        up a chair and throws it at the big man's feet. Shaq responds by tossing 
        the chair right back at college basketball's biggest bully, making Knight 
        cry all the way back to Texas Tech. </p>
      <p align="left">
        #9-The sports fans of Maine finally realize that NASCAR is not a sport 
        or even a spectator event. In order to more aptly capture the essence 
        of this silly pastime, NASCAR powers rename the racing circuit with the 
        acronym PIATL, or &quot;punch it and turn left.&quot; (Thank you Ryan).</p>
      <p align="left">
        #8-While we're on the Maine subject, let's turn our attention to the lovely 
        Bowdoin campus. It's about time that men's varsity basketball team accepts 
        the challenge of the intramural all-stars. You thought last night's women's 
        hockey game between Bowdoin and Colby was an event to watch? Just wait 
        until the intramural ballers take on the big boys.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #7-In the Western Conference Finals, I want to watch the Houston Rockets 
        take on the Los Angeles Lakers in a series decided in the waning minutes 
        of the seventh game. With the Lakers trailing by a single point and only 
        three seconds left, Kobe pounds the ball into Shaq with Yao holding him 
        on the block. At the buzzer, Shaq lofts a baby hook over Ming's out-stretched 
        hand and scores the winning basket. Next year, however, the Rockets will 
        sweep the Lakers and establish the Ming Dynasty.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #6-Before this epic game ever takes place, however, the Kobe Bryant-Michael 
        Jordan comparisons will be dropped. First of all, no one will ever displace 
        MJ as the game's greatest clutch player. Secondly, it's like asking if 
        Batman is as much of a badass as Superman. In the end, does it really 
        matter who saves the day?</p>
      <p align="left">
        #5-High school athletic associations from across the country step forward 
        and apologize for their embarrassing treatment of phenom LeBron James. 
        His entire season has been an endless string of investigations in which 
        the star is constantly being cleared to play. Recently, referee Tony Celantano 
        posed for cameras with James after a basketball game. As a result, the 
        New Jersey chapter of the International Association of Approved Basketball 
        Officials is investigating referee misconduct. Let the kid play without 
        a circus-I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!</p>
      <p align="left">
        #4-David Stern realizes that it would be counterproductive to fix the 
        NBA Lottery so that New York gets the first pick. With Allan Houston and 
        Latrell Sprewell under contract together for the next four years, the 
        Knicks' backcourt is already too full. Big man Darko Milicic is a much 
        better fit for a team without much of an inside presence. Thanks to Stern's 
        keen realization, the Denver Nuggets win the LeBron James sweepstakes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #3-Governor Mike Johanns of Nebraska successfully pushes through his proposed 
        bill that would pay Cornhusker football players. Although his recent overture 
        may be nothing more than a reelection plea in a state that loves football 
        even more than Texas does, this governor's views on the amateur game are 
        right on the money. Justifying the bill, Johanns said, &quot;College football 
        has become a multimillion-dollar industry that should do much better for 
        its athletes.&quot; For those critics out there, you know he's right - 
        college football has changed a little bit since Rudy's era.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #2-The U.S. government steps forward to thwart the New York Yankees attempt 
        to win every single World Series for the next century. With a payroll 
        approaching $170 million, George Steinbrenner has gone overboard. More 
        disturbingly, he has stockpiled seven starting pitchers, including free 
        agent signee Jose Contreras. Poor Joe Torre has a real problem on his 
        hands! He has to choose five starters out of a pool of seven potential 
        all stars. Remind me, why is he referred to as the game's best manager? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The only possible solution that would bring some equality to Major League 
        Baseball would be for the U.S. government to bust up the Yankees and create 
        two teams. Then they would have three or four all-star pitches apiece. 
        Heck, one of those teams would still probably win the Series. Look what 
        the D-Backs did with just two starters in 2001.</p>
      <p align="left">
        #1-However, we all know that &quot;W&quot; would never mettle with Major 
        League Baseball (after all, that's a war he might lose). As a result, 
        the Yankees will only get stronger before the season even begins. In a 
        surprise Spring Training trade, the 28-year-old GM of the Red Sox, trades 
        Nomar Garciaparra to the Yankees for three no-name Minor Leaguers and 
        a bundle of cash. If the Yanks can get by with seven starting pitchers, 
        why not have two shortstops?</p>
      <p align="left">
        To accommodate the crowded infield, Alfonso Soriano slides to third base, 
        Derek Jeter graciously plays second, and Nomar becomes the starting shortstop 
        of the America's best team. Can't you just imagine Steinbrenner cheering 
        as Jeter and Nomar turn double-plays together? Ah, the headlines in Boston 
        would be precious: &quot;Nomore Nomaaar!&quot;</p>
