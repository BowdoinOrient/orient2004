        </font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;People have told me they think I'm 
        moody, and I guess I do get my fair share of the blues. How would I know 
        if I'm depressed and need medication?&quot; T.J.</p>
      <p>Dear T.J.: We all feel blue and moody from time to time, and transitory 
        feelings of sadness, self-doubt, or discouragement are likely to be perfectly 
        normal and situational. Depression, on the other hand, lasts longer, is 
        more intense, more pervasive, deeper, and incapacitating. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Depression comes in many forms and degrees. Common symptoms include the 
        following: </p>
      <p align="left"> -feelings of sadness, hopelessness or irritability, that 
        have no clear cause or seem out of proportion<br>
        -feelings of worthlessness, helplessness or guilt<br>
        -loss of interest in usual activities, including eating and sex<br>
        -insomnia or oversleeping, along with low energy levels and fatigue<br>
        -chronic aches and pains, especially headaches and abdominal pain, that 
        defy diagnosis and don't respond to treatment<br>
        -abusive use of alcohol or drugs (really &quot;self-medication&quot;)<br>
        -persistent thoughts of death, self-harm, or suicide</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are a number of &quot;symptom checklists&quot; you can run through 
        on your own if you think you might be depressed. Both the Health Center 
        and the Counseling Center websites have a totally confidential and anonymous 
        on-line self-screening test for depression (and alcohol abuse and eating 
        disorders too). Both websites also have links to other sources of helpful 
        information about depression and other screening tests.</p>
      <p align="left">
        You are, of course, always most welcome to come into the Health Center 
        or the Counseling Center to talk things over. All of us have considerable 
        experience in helping people sort their feelings out and certainly can 
        help you figure out what the right next steps for you might be.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Depression is VERY common. Some experts estimate that 1 of every 5 adults 
        will experience clinical depression at some point in their lives. American 
        Family Physician reports that depression is the second most common chronic 
        disorder, mental or physical, seen by primary care providers in their 
        offices. 8 percent of adolescents, and even 2 percent of children are 
        thought to suffer from depression. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Not surprisingly, depression is also very common here under the Pines. 
        In the 2002 Spring Survey of Students, over 80 percent reported feeling 
        depressed (more than just unhappy) at least a few times each year. More 
        than half reported worrying about their mental health and more still felt 
        negatively impacted by someone else's mental or emotional problems. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bob Vilas, our Director of Counseling, has reported that in 2001-2002, 
        310 students visited the Counseling Center a total of 1,900 times, up 
        from 1,300 visits per year by 225 students in the mid-nineties.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin is by no means unusual in this regard. A recent article in The 
        New York Times reported a 40 percent increase in student visits to Columbia 
        University's Counseling Center over that same period of time. At Kansas 
        State University, the number of students treated for depression doubled 
        between 1989 and 2001, as did the percentage of students taking psychiatric 
        medications, and, most unfortunately, the number of suicidal students 
        there. </p>
      <p>The Times report also considered underlying causes for these trends. 
        It cited greater pressures on students to succeed academically and the 
        breakdown of family support systems. It also suggested that there might 
        be greater awareness of mental illness and an easing of the stigma attached 
        to seeking psychiatric care. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Clearly, the greater availability of effective psychotropic medications 
        with few untoward side effects has also played a central role. Medications 
        have helped many people advance in their schooling and careers, when they 
        might not have been able to do so years ago.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are a wide variety of helpful treatments available for those struggling 
        with depression. Come in to the Counseling Center or Health Center to 
        talk it over. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are also some student-led campus groups and activities that focus 
        on depression and other emotional disorders. They hope to disseminate 
        information about these problems, provide more open support for those 
        who struggle with them, and help remove the embarrassment and sense of 
        shame they have historically carried.</p>
      <p align="left">
        These student-led efforts are critically important. A national survey 
        of college counseling service directors reported a total of 166 student 
        suicides at 55 colleges last year. Only 20 of those students had ever 
        been seen at their college counseling centers before their deaths.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Talk to us, and talk to each other. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Take good care of yourselves - and take good care of each other! </p>
