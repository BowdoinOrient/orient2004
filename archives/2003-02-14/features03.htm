        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">For an education class last term I researched how to teach 
        and optimize creativity. I found that while creativity is unique and varies 
        from person to person, there are concrete ways in which people can explore 
        their creative process and optimize it. From self observation we can discover 
        how our process varies when we are creatively successful and when we are 
        &quot;stuck&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While I explored my own creativity and found how helpful the awareness 
        of my process of creating was in successfully accomplishing different 
        projects, I began to wonder why exploring my creative process seemed somewhat 
        out of the ordinary in a setting where most of what I do involves absorbing 
        information and turning it into some kind of innovative product: papers, 
        pieces of art, proposals, presentations, meetings, interviews, parties, 
        and math problems. I began to ask fellow students in all classes to tell 
        me about the three most important things that they had learned from their 
        time at Bowdoin. Each of my interviewees mentioned at least one major 
        thing (and sometimes all three) about their creative process. Of course 
        it makes sense that we learn about how we think and create during our 
        time in college. We are constantly overwhelmed by information to absorb 
        and deadlines by which we have to produce something with our recently 
        acquired information. But if our creative process is such an important 
        part of our education, then why haven't I ever had a professor ask me 
        what I did to write a good paper instead of simply telling me that the 
        product was good? Or had a discussion in class about reading strategies 
        when it was clear that half the class had understood a concept but the 
        other half had totally missed it? I feel that for us students to explore 
        our abilities and be as successful in a class as possible, we need to 
        be encouraged to explore our creative process and its connection to a 
        finished product.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I have a few basic suggestions. Every writing class at Bowdoin should 
        include a revision. The revision should not consist of listening to a 
        professors criticisms and making the necessary adjustments. It should 
        consist of taking a successful paper, looking at what made it successful, 
        and then applying those strategies to an unsuccessful paper. A revision 
        could also be an opportunity to rewrite a paper from a different point 
        of view or style, after being exposed to new information, and thereby 
        seeing how the content affects the writing process. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Students' experiences and perceptions of their own work should be given 
        more weight. At some point in each class students should be asked about 
        their own creations - which paper they enjoyed writing the most, which 
        one came out the best, how they had known they had finished writing the 
        paper, how they had started writing the paper, which book they most enjoyed 
        reading and specifically what was different about that book, what environment 
        they work in most successfully, what they experience when they work successfully. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        First-year orientation should include some kind of discussion about education, 
        thinking, learning, and creating at Bowdoin. When I asked students about 
        the three most important things that they had learned in college, I also 
        asked them what they remembered from orientation that had to do with education. 
        The only things that people remembered were bits of advice about spacing 
        out classes, prioritizing activities over one another, and making personal 
        connections with professors. The important things that one learns from 
        college should correlate with the important things that one is introduced 
        to college with. People don't often look back on their Bowdoin education 
        and say that the best things they learned were how to drink responsibly, 
        practice safe voluntary sex, and listen to speakers. Bowdoin's first year 
        orientation should be focused on conversations about how to read and listen 
        to lectures efficiently, manage one's time, use different methods of perceiving 
        information (visual, auditory, kinesthetic), and use different strategies 
        for writing papers. We should be actively learning about how our personal 
        strategies play an integral part in our education throughout our college 
        experience</p>
