        HUMOR COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> February 14 usually brings as much frustration into the 
        lives of Bowdoin students as it does joy. This is the dual nature of love: 
        can't live with it, can't live without it. I suppose I should leave the 
        love-life articles to Kara, but I am tempted to do something with the 
        Saint Valentine's Day theme. In general, Cupid has been good to me; I 
        have been in a wonderful relationship for two and a half years. I only 
        wish my love affair with dining service had gone so smoothly.</p>
      <p>Two years and fifteen pounds ago I came to Bowdoin College as a pre-frosh. 
        I walked beneath the pines, took the tour of the art museum, bought a 
        four dollar pen at the Bookstore, and ate at Thorne Dining Hall. That 
        day they were serving sweet potato french fries. Make no mistake about 
        it, I feel in love with the meal plan. In fact, I enrolled at Bowdoin 
        the following January largely in anticipation of our nationally acclaimed 
        meals. Maybe that is why I hold our Dining Service to such high standards, 
        and why I feel so betrayed. </p>
      <p>Like many patrons of Thorne Dining Hall, I have always frequented the 
        salad bar. Last semester, in an effort to lose the body padding I have 
        gained while at school, I searched among the cluster of salad dressings 
        for a palatable alternative to my preferred lard-based toppings. The scene 
        was a familiar one.</p>
      <p>The dressing containers were almost indistinguishable from one another, 
        resembling giant hamster-cage water bottles. Half the labels were illegible; 
        I began to panic. There I stood for fifteen minutes, staring above and 
        through the sneeze guard looking like a ten-year-old immersed in a Where's 
        Waldo. For the life of me, I could not find the dressing I wanted: lite 
        ranch. Frustrated by what I assumed was my cafeteria version of &quot;refrigerator 
        blindness,&quot; I selected lite Italian and scurried on to my table.</p>
      <p>I have one word to describe the lite Italian: OhMyGodIsThatDisgusting! 
        Seriously, it smells like ammonia and pickles but tastes even worse. The 
        bitter, piercingly tart liquid destroyed my salad and actually dissolved 
        two tomatoes. I am convinced that it is a composite of a cleaning solution. 
        Maybe we should use it to clean the Polar Bear's butt? Okay, maybe not. 
      </p>
      <p>Having ruined a perfectly average bowl of wilted lettuce and croutons, 
        I approached a dining service employee with some questions.</p>
      <p>My first question had to do with the quality of the lite Italian dressing. 
        The dining service person was very kind, and I believe somewhat amused 
        by my inquiry. They had never tried the lite Italian, but ensured me it 
        was not a cleaning solution. My second question had to do with lite ranch. 
        I was informed Thorne does not currently carry a lite ranch option. I 
        almost cried.</p>
      <p>The Dining Service person said that if I really felt strongly about salad 
        dressing, I should fill out a comment card. I did so carefully, and anxiously 
        waited one week for a response to be posted on the Comment Card Wall of 
        Fame. </p>
      <p>Well, I remain less than impressed by the Dining Service response. They 
        suggested that I mix in some skim milk with regular ranch. Listen, if 
        I wanted to prepare food I wouldn't have a meal plan. Considering the 
        price of board these days, I shouldn't even have to pour my own milk let 
        alone get creative with it.</p>
      <p>The reply to my comment card also mentioned that Thorne would not be 
        offering lite ranch anytime soon since over a dozen dressings are already 
        offered. I agree the variety is generous, maybe even excessive. Yet, I 
        am convinced that a lite ranch option would be widely used and enjoyed. 
        We clearly can't expect to add another dressing, but why not substitute 
        lite ranch for one of our less popular dressings? </p>
      <p>Case in point: fat free red tomato. If you have ever used this dressing, 
        please write a letter to the editor and explain yourself. Are regular 
        tomatoes too much of a hassle to chew, are pureed tomatoes that worthwhile? 
        Why not just toss on a few tomato chunks and skip the dressing, or do 
        you need the double fix? I am really confused here. What's next, lettuce 
        flavored salad dressing?</p>
      <p>In the meantime I am still filling out comment cards, bitterly brokenhearted. 
        Things are getting really bad between Dining Services and me; my last 
        two comment cards stand without reply. Why can't I just let it go, maybe 
        eat somewhere else? Well, as in any love affair, breaking up is hard to 
        do.<br>
