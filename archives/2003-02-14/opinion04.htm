      <p align="left"><font size="5">Rumsfeld lacks the soft touch<br>
        <font size="2">ALEXANDER DUNCAN</font><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I admire Donald Rumsfeld, much to my surprise. In fact, 
        I have his biography sitting on my desk. Never mind that it was a freebee 
        or that it's been there since September and I've read no more than fifty 
        pages. The fact is, I own it, and some day might get around to reading 
        the whole thing. <br>
        <br>
        I think I must have fallen victim to the outbreak of &quot;Love Your Military&quot; 
        that swept across the country in the days following September 11. As Secretary 
        of Defense, Rumsfeld was a clear honoree in that admiration fest, and 
        his popularity and my admiration continued to grow when, as B-52s carpeted 
        the harsh climes of Afghanistan with ordinance, he proved to be particularly 
        adept at the art of the press conference. <br>
        There he would stand in the Pentagon, playing the role of the intermediary 
        between our indomitable military forces and the mostly clueless civilian 
        like me, who sat captivated by grainy images of our elite troops tumbling 
        out of airplanes at night to pulverize the terrible people who knocked 
        our towers down. And when he wasn't quenching our thirst for revenge, 
        he would, much to our collective delight, punctuate the conference by 
        flattening some overly enthusiastic Pentagon correspondent who got a little 
        too close to the military's secret cookie jar, doing so with a snide yet 
        not entirely unreasonable remark about military confidentiality. And I 
        ate it up (like many other Americans) and in fact still do, as long as 
        he's in the Pentagon briefing room. <br>
        <br>
        The problem is that dear Donald Rumsfeld has taken his daily press conference 
        overseas to unhappy Europe, where he's become the spokesman for Dubya's 
        war in Iraq. Quite frankly, he might be the single worst person to try 
        to convince skeptical Europeans to go to war. While he doesn't exude the 
        President's buckaroo vibe (which surely also makes most Europeans cringe), 
        he's oozing with American elitism and a &quot;We'll go it on our own&quot; 
        attitude, which can't be any better. All of this has come into practice 
        in recent weeks in the form of inflammatory &quot;Old Europe&quot; comments 
        and the like. What Rumsfeld seems not to know (or more likely not care 
        about, given that he's clearly quite intelligent), is that other people 
        around the globe don't want to go to war (if in fact Americans do), and 
        don't want to hear the same gung-ho language that lit the patriotic fire 
        in America immediately after September 11. They need to be convinced, 
        not intimidated or berated.<br>
        <br>
        For example, yes, the French are frustratingly obstinate whenever the 
        U.S. wants to take action of some kind, but to discount them entirely 
        by implying that they are a relic of an older era is entirely counterproductive. 
        I'm no diplomat, but wouldn't it make more sense to impress upon the French 
        the point that their time is now, and that they can prove their substance 
        by joining in a fight against the world's ills? Rumsfeld's rhetoric is 
        unfit for a situation that demands a softer diplomatic touch.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, at the same time that Secretary Rumsfeld was testing alliances 
        in Europe, Secretary of State Colin Powell demonstrated his far superior 
        diplomatic abilities, in spite of the fact that he, unlike Rumsfeld, is 
        a career military man. Perhaps the lone dove in a flock of Bush administration 
        hawks (though some would say that he's sprouted talons and a hooked beak 
        in recent weeks), Powell nevertheless took on the role of war supporter, 
        and did so with a cool, convincing, and steady manner in the U.N. Security 
        Council. If we are to succeed in garnering international support for a 
        war in Iraq (assuming of course, that the Bush Administration actually 
        cares to do so, which they may not), let those like Colin Powell present 
        the argument, and bring Rumsfeld back to the Pentagon podium.</p>
      <p>That way we have a chance of getting international support from other 
        than Britain and Tony Blair (who might roll over if Bush told him to), 
        and I can like Rumsfeld again, and even better, keep his biography. </p>
