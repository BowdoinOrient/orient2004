      <p align="left">Kresge is once again home to an eclectic art show. Three 
        Bowdoin seniors came together to produce the semester's second display 
        which opened on Thursday, February 6. Despite having no collective title 
        or ideal, Abbie Klein, Evan Matzen, and Micah Roberge assembled an exhibit 
        in which each individual's work played off the others'.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After being unable to find an all-encompassing title that captured all 
        three bodies of work, the group settled on separate ones. Klein's &quot;Portraits,&quot; 
        Matzen's &quot;Mean Aestheticism,&quot; and Roberge's &quot;Chaos&quot; 
        demonstrate that Bowdoin's non-art majors can produce a visually pleasing 
        and intellectually stimulating presentation.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Matzen, the most experienced photographer of the three, has experimented 
        with the medium since he was a child, he later worked at a one-hour photo 
        shop for a year. Roberge and Klein had never attempted creative photography 
        until their sophomore years of college. &quot;I had started to get interested 
        in using photography in a more artistic manner in high school but hadn't 
        really pursued it,&quot; said Klein.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Roberge's &quot;Chaos&quot; is a collection of silver gellatin black and 
        white prints which lead the viewer through a visual tour of perceived 
        randomness. &quot;One thing I was trying to do is suggest through the 
        things I found a chaotic or seemingly random system that you can look 
        at on an individual basis,&quot; said Roberge. A series of black coffee 
        cups contrast highly with the gray background and the steam emitting from 
        each cylinder. The swirls themselves create a hypnotic effect, captured 
        consecutively through only a few ticks on a watch's second hand. Holding 
        true to its title, the prints display a random series which nonetheless 
        never fail to adhere to its expected shape. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Among Roberge's five series is &quot;Order,&quot; an ironically aware 
        set of prints. The photographer reveals the seemingly 'chaotic' nature 
        of the center of a sunflower with two close shots of the plant. However, 
        he notes the strictly formatted nature of the center's growth: a planned 
        sequence known as the Fibonacci Sequence. Roberge aptly titles one piece, 
        &quot;0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The photos of Abbie Klein reveal an artist interested in not only the 
        final product but the process itself. What started out as a personal challenge 
        has manifested itself into a minimalist yet inventive presentation. &quot;I 
        was afraid to walk up to people and ask if I could take their picture. 
        I was testing my own limits about what I was comfortable with in terms 
        of photography,&quot; she said. Klein, who keeps a running list of faces 
        that she finds interesting or engaging displayed 14 portraits of equal 
        size and contrast. All in black and white, (Bowdoin does not have the 
        means for color development) the images were taken in the McClellan studio 
        in front of a drape of white fabric. In the pupil of each subject is a 
        reflection of Klein and her camera-a reminder of each work's construction.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Like Noah Lambie '03 and Cecily Upton's '03 &quot;White Trash&quot; exhibit, 
        Klein takes inherently invaluable test strips of film from her portraits, 
        tying them together to form four visually pleasing pieces. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I got very interested in the editing process that occurs in photography. 
        Test strips I think are really beautiful in their own way so I wanted 
        to deal with the issues of editing but also the beauty of these things 
        that a lot of the time just get thrown out.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Unlike his partners, Matzen takes a more inconspicious approach with his 
        camera. His &quot;Mean Aestheticism&quot; aims to study life, not in the 
        social, political or cultural aspects, but instead life in general-the 
        combination of colors, distinct characters of people, geometric shapes 
        of objects. Matzen, who spent 17 weeks in Vietnam and two in Japan had 
        taken the photos for himself but hoped to get a show either at Bowdoin 
        or another venue. &quot;I was especially excited to get a spot because 
        I'm not a studio arts major,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Matzen's ten color photographs study life in Vietnam through the invisible 
        eye of the photographer. His shots depict a culture void of modern technological 
        means but invested in the life of its work animals. In one shot a boy 
        hugs the neck of a soft brown cow; in another, a Vietnamese child sits 
        atop an ox while his country's flag flies in the background. &quot;I was 
        really taken by the people there and how they fit into their surroundings.&quot; 
        Contrasting sharply with the black and white prints of &quot;Chaos&quot; 
        and &quot;Portraits,&quot; Matzen's vivid images couple intimate street 
        portraits with wide open spaces such as &quot;Gulf of Tonkin&quot; in 
        which the green water almost overwhelms the viewer. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Yet again Kresge lays claim to a collection of photographs by talented 
        artists, even if they're not Visual Arts majors. By testing the boundaries 
        of their medium, these artists achieve beautiful prints with their dedication 
        and strength of vision.</p>
