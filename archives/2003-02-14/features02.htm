      <p align="left">John Finzer Presnell, Jr. was born in Portland, Maine in 
        1914 when, across a great ocean, the First World War was being waged on 
        the fields of France and on the beaches of Italy. Nine days after Presnell 
        turned four years old, Germany surrendered. As the boy matured and attended 
        Portland High School, the defeated Germany birthed the Weimar Republic, 
        which attempted to grow with the rest of the European continent, only 
        to be reminded at every turn of its troubled past. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Treaty of Versailles had bred such hatred and animosity-as it laid 
        the blame for the entire war on the German people-that elements of the 
        community never forgot nor forgave the outside world. Some dreamt of sciences 
        and new ways to live peacefully while still others dreamt of a new empire-a 
        new dawn-for Aryan peoples. It was this latter element that soon gained 
        strength and power in the gathering storm that was fed by weakness and 
        U.S. inaction. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a withering and weak League of Nations failed-thanks to the refusal 
        of the U.S. to abide by its laws-a new Germany was born out of the fires 
        of anger and human hatred. It was a new Reich that would soon spread its 
        evil across a continent and change the world forever.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In Maine, John Presnell grew strong and, after graduating from high school 
        in 1932, attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick. The youth worked hard 
        in his undergraduate career, enjoying the delights of Kenneth Charles 
        Morton Sills' small New England college. Presnell did well in his academic 
        career-graduating Phi Beta Kappa in the Class of 1936. Then, following 
        in the proud tradition of many great characters of history, John F. Presnell, 
        Jr. went on to attend the Military Academy at West Point. </p>
      <p align="left">
        From the Hudson, he wrote back to the College, simplifying his experience 
        for the Bowdoin Alumnus: &quot;When&#133;a West Point Cadet has received 
        his diploma and his degree of Bachelor of Science, he has not only the 
        same sort of sheepskin as the Bowdoin graduate, but also a commission 
        as a Second Lieutenant in the Army, and a motto that will be part of him 
        for the rest of his life: 'Duty, Honor, Country.'&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        It was in the pursuit of &quot;duty, honor, country&quot; that Presnell 
        accepted his first assignment to the Philippines after graduating from 
        the Point with the highest rating in mathematics-earning for himself the 
        Robert E. Lee Memorial Sword. Aside from his Second Lieutenant's commission 
        in the prestigious Corps of Engineers, Presnell also received the Sons 
        of the American Revolution Cup for military efficiency and the General 
        John J. Pershing Sword for his position as a cadet captain and a regimental 
        commander. Presnell set sail for the Philippines in August, 1940. He continued 
        his good record and, a year later, had almost earned the rank of First 
        Lieutenant. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In recognition of his achievements and to note his alma mater's pride 
        at an excellent record, President Sills wrote to the young officer on 
        December 1, 1941:</p>
      <p align="left">
        I thought since it takes about a month for a letter from Brunswick to 
        reach the Philippines I would just send you a line to wish you a Merry 
        Christmas and a Happy New Year. Our thoughts at the college often go out 
        to those of you who are in distant parts of the world. We are always glad 
        to hear what you are doing, always hope that you will feel we are deeply 
        interested in the men in the service. Allow me to congratulate you on 
        your promotion so soon to a first lieutenancy; that seems to imply you 
        are doing fine work.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Presnell probably never read this letter. Six days after it was written 
        Imperial Japanese warplanes bombed the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor 
        and seven days later, on December 8, 1941, they began their invasion of 
        the Philippines.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Japanese struck swiftly. As Franklin Roosevelt was telling the nation 
        that the U.S. was finally entering the war and Bowdoin officials learned 
        that two of their own had been killed at Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes 
        knocked out a large number of the American aircraft stationed in the Philippines 
        under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur. By December 22, 
        MacArthur's airforce was reduced to only a few fighters and long range 
        B-17 bombers-not nearly enough to halt the swarms of Japanese planes, 
        which patrolled the skies in support of General Homma Masaharu's Fourteenth 
        Army, comprised of approximately 57,000 troops. </p>
      <p align="left">
        MacArthur commanded a total of about 31,000 regular American and Filipino 
        troops along with 110,000 &quot;low-grade&quot; Philippine troops. The 
        Japanese moved up from their Luzon landings on December 22, pushing MacArthur's 
        troops before them. Two days later, General MacArthur shifted his headquarters 
        to the mouth of Manila Bay-Correigidor Island two miles off the coast 
        of the Bataan Peninsula. A day after Christmas, Manila fell and a few 
        days after the turn of the year, MacArthur and his command were established 
        on Bataan, which was about twenty-five miles long and twenty in width. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Here a state of siege began. American supplies ran low in very short time, 
        having to feed over 100,000 soldiers and civilians. Tropical diseases 
        such as malaria took their toll, both on the fighting men and the officers 
        who commanded them. Both U.S. and Japanese forces suffered in agony-the 
        Japanese having about 10,000 troops down with malarial fever. The situation, 
        however, favored the Japanese, who were able to bring in fresh reinforcements-Washington 
        had decided early on that an attempt to rescue the American forces here 
        would not be undertaken. </p>
      <p align="left">
        When attacks against the American lines were resumed in spring of 1942, 
        both sides knew that the fight was basically over. To avoid unnecessary 
        bloodshed, U.S. General King-MacArthur having already left for Australia-surrendered 
        the Bataan survivors on April 9, 1942. Less than a month later, Correigidor-the 
        great fortress-also fell.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the fighting that followed the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, 
        Lt. Presnell fought gallantly and earned the Bronze Star, as well as a 
        promotion to Captain. He was interned in prison camps although the army 
        did not confirm this POW status to his parents until December, 1942. Also 
        captured on Bataan was another Bowdoin man: Major Robert T. Phillips-Class 
        of 1924-a member of the U.S. Army's Medical Corps. Both were captured 
        when the Bataan troops surrendered and managed to survive the horrific 
        Bataan Death March. Phillips, however, did not survive long in the inhumane 
        camps, which the Japanese set up. He died there on June 11, 1943. Presnell 
        was stronger and younger, but he too did not live to see his country victorious. 
        On January 19, 1945, weakened by years of imprisonment and by wounds sustained 
        in several POW ship sinkings, he died.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Captain Presnell died without knowing that within less than a year, Allied 
        troops would defeat the Axis after the bloodiest war in human history. 
        That victory was gained by both skill and intrepidity. In the Pacific, 
        the bloody island hopping campaign, which would eventually end with the 
        dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, began in the summer of 1942 when 
        elite troops of the First Marine Division-known as &quot;the Old Breed&quot;-entered 
        the war and began the reversal of the Japanese tide of conquest.</p>
      <p>Following the Fall of the Philippines and the victory at Midway, U.S. 
        commanders began a new campaign, hoping to halt the Japanese as they attempted 
        to spread and solidify their defensive parameter in the middle and southern 
        Pacific Ocean. The target for this, the first offensive by the U.S. Marines, 
        was a little known island named Guadalcanal.</p>
