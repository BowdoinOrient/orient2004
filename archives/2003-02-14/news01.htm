      <p align="left"> Bowdoin's Board of Trustees unanimously approved the fiscal 
        year 2003-2004 budget as proposed by the administration at their February 
        7 meeting. The vote made official the position elimination, program reduction, 
        and tuition increase decisions with which top administrators have been 
        grappling with for the past few weeks.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The FY 2003-2004 budget, prepared by Katy Longley, Senior Vice President 
        for Finance and Administration &amp; Treasurer and Nigel Bearman, Vice 
        President for Finance and Controller, anticipates revenues totaling $91.3 
        million for the operating budget. This funding, which comes from sources 
        such as gifts, endowment distribution and tuition and fees, will be split 
        between payroll and operations expenses. The financial aid budget is separate 
        and valued at $14.5 million The total FY 2003-2004 budget is close to 
        $105.8 million.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In order to achieve this balanced budget, Bowdoin decided to raise tuition 
        and fees by five percent for the 2003-2004 academic year and to reduce 
        funding to programs not believed by the administration to make a significant 
        contribution to the priorities of the College. Bowdoin also chose to reduce 
        total payroll by $1.2 million.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin employees have known for quite some time that department budgets 
        were tight but many were still surprised by the January 22, 2003 announcement 
        of position eliminations. In early fall of 2002, the Treasurer's Office 
        projected a net operating deficit for the current fiscal year and reductions 
        to expenses were made soon thereafter. In late November of 2002, however, 
        senior administrators realized that significant additional cuts to programming 
        and payroll would have to be made in order to achieve a balanced budget 
        for FY 2003-2004.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The $1.2 million reduction in payroll, which accounts for approximately 
        54 percent of operational expenses, translates into the elimination of 
        11 currently vacant positions, the expiration of eight &quot;casual or 
        temporary&quot; positions and the laying off of the equivalent of ten 
        full time administrative and support staff positions. In addition to these 
        reductions, five employees opted to take early retirement and about 18 
        employees agreed to work reduced hours. After this budget is implemented, 
        the number of full time equivalent employees at the College will drop 
        from 795 to 760. </p>
      <p align="left">
        According to Longley, &quot;employees affected by staff reductions had 
        lengths of service to Bowdoin ranging from one year to over 35 years.&quot; 
        She calls the severance package &quot;comparatively generous&quot; at 
        eight weeks pay plus one week for each year of service, with benefit options 
        that would affect the dollar amount. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These employees also were given 30 days notice, a policy which Bill Torrey, 
        Senior Vice President for Planning and Administration and Chief Development 
        Officer, describes as &quot;the humane way to handle the situation because 
        it gives those affected the option to stay or leave earlier if they desire.&quot; 
        He emphasized that the program cuts were based on programs and not on 
        performance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Longley points out that the four week transition period also allows managers 
        some time to &quot;assess the impact of position reductions on their departments 
        and programs and to reorganize functions and responsibilities.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Personnel cuts were made in several areas, including: Admissions, Alumni 
        Relations, Academic Affairs, Athletics, Communications &amp; Public Affairs, 
        Development, Facilities, Educational Technology Center, Computing &amp; 
        Information Services, the Library, and Student Affairs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The FY 2003-2004 budget proposal explained that these position eliminations 
        would help Bowdoin &quot;operate in financial equilibrium- a significant 
        challenge in an uncertain economy.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Also articulated in the budget proposal were the College's top three priorities 
        as established in September of 2002. These priorities are to maintain 
        and enhance the academic program, to preserve access to a Bowdoin education, 
        (supported by the &quot;need blind&quot; admissions policy) and to uphold 
        Bowdoin's strong sense of community and respect for its faculty and staff. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        These priorities in place as guidelines, Dean of Student Affairs Craig 
        Bradley, Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and Treasurer 
        Katy Longley, Dean for Academic Affairs Craig McEwen, Dean of Admissions 
        and Financial Aid Jim Miller, and Senior Vice President for Planning and 
        Administration and Chief Development Officer Bill Torrey were given the 
        responsibility of identifying ways to reduce their division's budget. 
        Each department was asked to make cuts, but &quot;particular attention 
        was paid to those divisions that had seen the most growth in recent years,&quot; 
        according to Longley. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In Student Affairs, Bradley focused on the potential impact to students 
        when considering cuts. He describes his staff as a &quot;strong team&quot; 
        and points to nine members who took one to two month voluntary work schedule 
        reductions. According to Bradley, &quot;this set of choices enabled us 
        to not have to cut another whole position.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        These schedule reductions will take place over the summer and are not 
        expected to impact students during the academic year, though summer planning 
        and project work will be negatively impacted. Student Affairs accepted 
        one early retirement, made one layoff and will leave one vacant position 
        unfilled.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Jeff Ward made the cuts in the Athletics Department, a part of the Student 
        Affairs division, that totaled $200,000, or seven percent of his budget, 
        and resulted in the controversial elimination of the alpine ski team.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Academic Affairs was not immune to cuts despite its intimate connection 
        to the core mission of the College. Charged with protecting academic programs, 
        McEwen eliminated a position in his office and made cuts to the library. 
        He explained that students can expect reduced hours, based on student-use 
        studies conducted by Librarian Sherrie Bergman to go into effect in the 
        fall. Further, some members of library staff will work reduced hours in 
        the summer.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The library will also look to reduce periodical subscriptions and book 
        purchases. Bowdoin has a very strong endowment for the library, which 
        McEwen calls a &quot;crucial sustaining force,&quot; but campus scholars 
        may have to rely more heavily on Inter-Library Loan.</p>
      <p align="left">
        McEwen also reduced the budget allocated to bringing adjunct professors 
        to class for the 2003-2004 academic year. He does not believe this will 
        affect students significantly since adjuncts teach courses &quot;on the 
        edge of the curriculum&quot; and students interested in courses that might 
        potentially have been offered could pursue independent studies.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The College cut $850,000 from technology spending, $400,000 from payroll 
        and $450,000 from operational reductions, most significantly affecting 
        Computing and Information Services (CIS). The College plans to bring a 
        chief information officer on board this fiscal year to oversee organization 
        restructuring in this area and improvement to Bowdoin's use of the web.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In Admissions, Miller eliminated one and a half full time positions and 
        spread the rest of his cuts across the printing of publications and to 
        some extent, staff. Administration of the alumni interviewing program, 
        BASIC, will be distributed among staff, likely by region, instead of concentrated 
        to one point person. Miller states, &quot;we're not trying to do less, 
        we're trying to do things more efficiently.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        He also emphasized the positives side of budget cuts. He calls them &quot;a 
        challenge and an opportunity,&quot; referring to the reevaluations of 
        programs according to priorities of the College that have taken place 
        during the past few weeks. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Torrey believes that his positions and programming reductions in the Development 
        Office and Facilities will have minimal impact on students. The Communications 
        and Public Affairs Office lost personnel, but Torrey does not believe 
        that these cuts will significantly change the way Bowdoin communicates 
        with the on and off campus community. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Alumni Relations lost the equivalent of two full time positions and Torrey 
        says, &quot;our alumni programs will be somewhat affected, as we will 
        no longer be able to serve the alumni career counseling program as we 
        have in the past and we are cutting back on staff support to alumni clubs 
        and their activities.&quot; He points out that the Reunion Program was 
        actually strengthened with the addition of a part time position.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mills is optimistic that all of the initiatives created by alumni over 
        the past few years can continue with creative resource allocation and 
        increased roles for volunteers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He explained, &quot;alumni just want to be assured that we have maintained 
        our priorities and then they are very, very supportive.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mills said that trustees during the process were &quot;incredibly responsible 
        and challenging because people asked hard questions and were thoughtful.&quot; 
        He describes them as being most concerned about increasing tuition and 
        fees because of the burden that will put on families and the financial 
        aid budget. According to Steve Joyce, Director of Student Aid, the portion 
        of the class of 2007 admitted under Early Decision I alone, will require 
        about $750,000 in aid. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Mills added, &quot;I'm convinced that the priorities that we set out in 
        terms of the academic program and creating access through financial aid 
        for students to come here and then creating a community that is going 
        to be stable enough to allow people to be here for their careers is really 
        the way decisions were made.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The FY 2003-2004 budget provides $400,000 for faculty salary increases, 
        which is expected to keep Bowdoin's current position as one of the top 
        five or six highest paying colleges in the 18-college comparison group. 
        The budget also contains $250,000 for administrative and support staff 
        wage increases and a $100,000 equity pay pool for staff which will be 
        distributed by Human Resources and the senior officers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The budget provides $110,000 for improvements in classroom audiovisual 
        equipment and $300,000 to upgrade the computer network and infrastructure.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The major maintenance budget will receive $3.6 million to preserve existing 
        structures. Some projects including the purchase of new student furniture 
        and a study of campus lighting and air conditioning needs will be deferred.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Though optimistic about the budget's ability to support core priorities, 
        Mills stated that cuts, especially in the form of layoffs, are never easy 
        to make. He believes that position elimination was harder, and should 
        be, to make them at Bowdoin because of &quot;a tradition of dedication 
        by our employees and by the College to its employees.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        He further points out that because Bowdoin isn't &quot;driven by the bottom 
        line, but by quality of education and community,&quot; deciding to eliminate 
        positions was especially difficult for administrators. Still, he is &quot;entirely 
        optimistic&quot; about the what the College can do in the future, even 
        though &quot;it will take some time to grow into the choices that were 
        made.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The College does not plan to issue a comprehensive list of reductions 
        to programs and departments, but will instead allow managers to announce 
        changes in services to the community as appropriate.</p>
