        <font size="2">KATHERINE CRANE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Who knew how dangerous it could be to be called an infidel 
        by Osama bin Laden?<br>
        <br>
        Up until Tuesday, when an Arab television station broadcast an audiotape 
        of bin Laden speaking to the Iraqi people, it might have seemed that being 
        on his infidel list could only make you the enemy of a small chunk of 
        the Arab world. The lesson for Saddam Hussein, who joined that list on 
        Tuesday, is that if the terrorists don't get you, the Americans will.<br>
        <br>
        In the tape, bin Laden exhorts all Muslims, but particularly Iraqis, to 
        fight against an American invasion of Iraq. He speaks of the distaste 
        that good Muslims will feel toward Saddam Hussein's &quot;apostate&quot; 
        government, but urges them to fight against the Americans nonetheless.<br>
        <br>
        The Bush Administration, which for months has been trying frantically 
        to prove a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda, has seized upon the 16-minute 
        tape as the ultimate proof of an &quot;unholy partnership&quot; between 
        the two. Bin Laden has expressed support for Iraq, the reasoning goes; 
        therefore he must have a longstanding alliance with Saddam Hussein. In 
        Bush's interpretation of the tape, bin Laden's attempts to rouse the Arab 
        world against Saddam are just camouflage to keep the U.S. from guessing 
        at the connection.<br>
        <br>
        This could only be the case if Bush were less obviously determined to 
        link Saddam to al-Qaeda. Considering that the government's reaction to 
        the tape was entirely predictable, it is only reasonable to assume that 
        bin Laden predicted it. Bin Laden had to know that the U.S. was so desperate 
        to find a connection between him and Iraq that even the faintest hint 
        of one could be a pretext for war.<br>
        <br>
        Bin Laden also had to know that Saddam Hussein does not want a war with 
        the United States, since Bush's stated purpose for such a war is to liberate 
        the Iraqi people from Saddam's oppressive regime. Yet with the war, according 
        to Bush, only weeks away, bin Laden is doing everything he can to bring 
        it even closer. If this is what bin Laden is like as an ally, we're probably 
        better off having him as an enemy.<br>
        <br>
        However, if bin Laden is in fact Saddam Hussein's enemy as well as ours, 
        his actions become much clearer. A war between the U.S. and Iraq will 
        further divide the Arab world from the Western world, and will give more 
        credibility to bin Laden's image of the Americans as crusading Christians. 
        It will also make the world a safer place for bin Laden, since the U.S. 
        will be too busy fighting phantom terrorists to bother about chasing down 
        a real one.<br>
        <br>
        While bin Laden dangles his supposed connection to Saddam Hussein in front 
        of George Bush like a chew toy in front of a dog, he is also telling his 
        Muslim followers that he does not approve of Saddam Hussein, but he does 
        approve of fighting against the United States. If fighting the Americans 
        means that they eventually oust or kill Saddam, that shouldn't worry the 
        Iraqis, because Saddam is an infidel. And once the Americans have gotten 
        rid of Saddam's regime, bin Laden's supporters can replace it with one 
        that is more sympathetic to al-Qaeda.<br>
        <br>
        Bin Laden has chosen to have many enemies, and he is very skilled at using 
        them against each other. By giving his support to the Iraqi people but 
        not to Saddam, he has instructed the United States to attack Saddam, and 
        the Iraqi people to attack the Americans. It's hard to tell about the 
        Iraqis, but the U.S. seems to be following orders.<br>
