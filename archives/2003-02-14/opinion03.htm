        <font size="2">PAT ROCKEFELLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Last week Katherine Crane wrote an article in which she 
        dismissed much of Colin Powell's speech to the U.N., as it failed to provide 
        a direct link between Iraq and al-Qaeda. She missed the point, however, 
        as the Bush Administration is not making its case based upon that alone. 
        Some have argued that there is a connection, and the recent tape with 
        bin Laden's voice on it suggests that he is willing to support Saddam 
        against their common enemy, but that still isn't the point. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The White House is not arguing that Saddam was complicit in the September 
        11 attacks. What they are arguing is that he is a threat and needs to 
        be taken care of, just as bin Laden is. The United Nations agreed on this 
        matter, and passed U.N. Resolution 1441. It was in regards to that resolution 
        that Powell spoke at the U.N. 1441 said that any efforts taken by Saddam 
        to prevent the inspectors from doing their job was a material breach, 
        and therefore, casus belli. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Crane argues that &quot;people who are flatly opposed to a doctrine of 
        pre-emptive warfare are unlikely to be swayed by a few minutes of intercepted 
        phone conversations on the order of 'The inspectors are coming! Did you 
        hide everything?'&quot; In relation to Powell's speech, this is an irrelevant 
        point. The United Nations passed the resolution, and if it wants to remain 
        a relevant institution, it has to enforce it. The point is that those 
        words alone prove that the inspections process is a joke, and that Iraq 
        has no intention of complying with the U.N. Why haven't they found any 
        weapons? Because Iraq has had ten years to practice hiding them.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Those who are against pre-emptive warfare have the right to protest, but 
        the United Nations, that saintly multilateral institution that was the 
        rallying point of all those opposed to bloody American cowboy unilateralism 
        has already said that action should be taken against Iraq if it refuses 
        to disarm. Those who spoke out against war with Iraq used the U.N. as 
        a shield, claiming it was the only legitimate institution that could decide 
        the future of Iraq. Now the U.N. has made its decision, and it is quite 
        clear that Iraq has been deceiving inspectors and hiding arms. Chemical 
        warheads have been found, mustard gas has been found, and there are huge 
        discrepancies in what Saddam claimed to have in 1991 and what he claims 
        to have now, in regards to tons of VX, anthrax, and other weapons. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The tie between terrorism and Iraq is not that the two are necessarily 
        directly linked, but that they certainly could be; if not now, then in 
        the future. Even if there was no conscious link, the mere proliferation 
        of weapons and germs and chemicals in an unstable country like Iraq increases 
        the likelihood that they would fall into the wrong hands, intentionally 
        or otherwise. In this sense, it doesn't matter if there is a direct link. 
        Understanding international terrorism as committed by extra-state entities 
        requires a look at the potential sources of weapons. As it turns out, 
        our own airports were a source of weapons, and we have taken precautions 
        to ensure that those weapons will not be used against us again. Similarly, 
        we are now looking to other sources of weapons, and that includes Iraq. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Crane finishes her pieces with that time-honored process of relating one's 
        political opponents to Hitler. She attempts to make her point that Bush 
        is unfairly tying Saddam to bin Laden by making the vague and absurd claim 
        of similar politics between Hitler and Bush. Hitler grouped his enemies 
        into one category, and Bush grouped America's enemies into one category 
        (Evil Doers) and Hitler was a bad man and wrong, and therefore Bush is 
        a bad man and wrong. Sadly, the transitive property does not always work 
        in politics. Hitler created the Autobahn. Eisenhower created the Interstate. 
        Doesn't make them the same thing. By the way, Hitler was also a vegetarian. 
        Draw your own conclusion. </p>
