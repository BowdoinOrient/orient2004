        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font><br>
        This week, we are back from the future (The Campus Revisited, last week) 
        to the author's past, in the early sixties, when neither the World Trade 
        Center nor the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge nor the English Channel Tunnel 
        existed yet. <br>
        To recap: six months after obtaining my Green Card, I was drafted, and 
        underwent Basic Training at Fort Ord, California. Later, I was stationed 
        with the 8th US Infantry Division at Bad Kreuznach, Germany, a well-known 
        spa with luxurious Kurhaus that, during the First World War, served as 
        the Kaiser's western headquarters.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As previously mentioned, I was assigned as interpreter and 
        maneuver damage clerk to the Civil Affairs and Public Information Office 
        of division headquarters.<br>
        This was located under the roof of the headquarters building at Rose Barracks, 
        named after a WW II Army General. It was originally built for the Kaiser's 
        Army, but, more recently, had been used by Hitler's Wehrmacht. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our Sergeant Major, of Polish extraction, was called Wroblesky 
        but nicknamed Wobbles, because his knees visibly buckled when called on 
        the carpet by Major Bligh, the PIO Officer, whose bark was worse than 
        his bite. <br>
        The truncated CA section (in wartime a proper staff section) consisted 
        of the CA Officer, Colonel Wilson, his deputy Lieutenant Stankevicius, 
        and me, a lowly Specialist Fourth Class. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wilson was a genial Southerner close to retirement. He and 
        Bligh sat at desks next to one another in a small room with a door always 
        open, just inside the entrance of the PIO Section.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wobbles at a desk across the hall directly facing them, 
        Stankevicius and I were out of harm's way in an alcove beneath the rafters. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our chief task was processing maneuver damage claims. These 
        were filed by farmers across whose fields US army tanks had rummaged during 
        maneuvers. The damage caused was, of course, greatly exaggerated to extract 
        maximum compensation, with payments on the generous side to maintain good 
        relations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I would generally do the typing and help the Lieutenant 
        prepare Disposition Forms to other General Staff sections. Actually a 
        Signal Corps Officer, with more technical than writing aptitude, Stankevicius 
        was glad to delegate the odious task of drafting DF's to me, someone with 
        a BA in English and experience in writing business letters. On occasion 
        our roles were reversed, and he ended up typing my drafts. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of Lithuanian birth, blue-eyed and with blond crew cut, 
        he had a visage reminiscent of those of my Bowdoin buddies. &quot;Stinky&quot; 
        was married to a black-haired German beauty named Rosemarie. One time 
        Stinky invited me to his home to meet his wife. Married officers and NCO's 
        lived in a special housing area close to the PX, or &quot;on the economy,&quot; 
        which was a private accommodation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With the two of us working in such close proximity and being 
        close in age, a certain intimacy developed between us. However, I had 
        to call him &quot;Sir,&quot; and salute when encountering him outside 
        the office, something I hated doing. <br>
        He, in turn, would call me by my last name. Not long married and apparently 
        still a novice as far as marital relations were concerned, Stinky one 
        day asked if I knew of any other position for intercourse than the so-called 
        &quot;missionary.&quot; <br>
        What a question to ask me of all people, with next to no heterosexual 
        experience thus far, apart from a brief affair with someone much older, 
        thank God not to be the only woman in my life.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, there were a couple of young ones, German civilians, 
        working in the PIO Section, whose main job was translating press cuttings 
        from German papers, one of whom was to become my girlfriend.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A brunette with freckled face and upturned nose, Helga had 
        just returned from spending a year with distant relatives in Argentina, 
        informally engaged to a rancher's son, but not sure if she really wanted 
        to marry yet. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After being taken out a few times, Helga invited me to her 
        home to meet her mother, a war widow. The family, including a younger 
        brother and grandmother, lived in a small but cozy flat under the roof 
        of a timbered house in the narrow main street of Bad Kreuznach.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pretty soon I began spending almost every other evening 
        at Helga's, arriving just in time for the Tagesschau, the main TV news 
        at eight. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So much a part of the family, Granny, off to bed early, 
        would give me a toothless grin when saying goodnight, apparently under 
        the impression Helga and I were as good as engaged. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After a while, her brother would disappear too, but the 
        mother would always stay up with us. Usually I would stay the whole evening, 
        watching TV with them and drinking wine, and not leave till after eleven, 
        with a 20-minute walk back to the barracks before the midnight curfew.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Helga would take me downstairs to let me out and lock the 
        front door behind me. Kissing her goodnight would take at least five minutes, 
        sometimes longer. Afterwards I felt like I was literally walking on air. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I don't think Helga and I were really in love though. She 
        was looking for someone to marry, and I for a girl to sleep with. Maybe 
        she thought if I was interested enough I might decide to stay in Germany. 
        When I started thinking seriously about marrying, I took Helga home to 
        introduce her to my family.<br>
        My mother liked her very much. But so did one of my brothers, more experienced 
        with girls. Tune in again next time.<br>
