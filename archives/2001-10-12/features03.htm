        From a luncheon with female trustees last semester, to a recent women-in-rock 
        concert, to an inviting resource center and library, various efforts have 
        been made to admire the blossoming presence of women in this little place 
        we call Bowdoin College. Part of this effort is reflected in the recent 
        visit of Dr. Mary Jacobsen, author of <i>Hand-Me-Down Dreams: How Families 
        Influence Our Career Paths</i> (NY: Three Rivers Press, 2000). Jacobsen 
        has more than fifteen years of experience as a psychotherapist, teacher, 
        career coach, and workshop leader. She has also taught at various colleges 
        around the nation and has even served as an Assistant Dean at Empire State 
        College of the State University of New York.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond an impressive r&eacute;sum&eacute;, it was clear 
        why Dr. Jacobsen's visit to Bowdoin was special. Her insight on both family 
        dynamics around work ethics and personal choices about work seemed fitting 
        in an environment where people do not really know what to do with their 
        educated selves. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One day before her scheduled talk in Common Hour, a small 
        group of students and faculty members gathered at Lancaster Lounge for 
        dinner with her. In a conversation about Thursday night bowling, the former 
        frat situation, and the choices one makes in life, Jacobsen was instrumental 
        in advising personal sincerity. She also discussed some of her findings 
        relevant to career choices, work ethics, and the role of the family in 
        supporting a student's career hopping. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jacobsen also addressed the &quot;tension between living 
        out someone else's expectations and one's own.&quot; Among other things, 
        she suggested that if a student finds his or herself stuck in trying to 
        please his or her parents or supporters, they will &quot;avoid conflict 
        and instead, motivate mutual empathy.&quot; With a small smile over some 
        charbroiled chicken and brown rice she stated, &quot;who you are is quite 
        relevant!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Further more, she invited us to &quot;communicate with our 
        parents.&quot; She stressed the importance of parents &quot;not burdening 
        you with fulfilling their own dreams.&quot; She assured, &quot;[your parents] 
        themselves are the only ones that can truly fill their gaps and their 
        dreams, not you.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the changing face of Bowdoin, celebrating difference 
        is as important as sorting our your heart and your bunny-hopping career 
        exploration. May the celebration of the presence of men, women, humans, 
        difference - never fade. I know that if I were here 30 years ago, I'd 
        be dead bored.</p>
