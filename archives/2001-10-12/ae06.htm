        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        Fame, glamour, cheap thrills, seduction, deception-does this sound like 
        your typical Bowdoin weekend? If not, prepare yourselves, because Masque 
        and Gown will bring a healthy dose of fast-paced living and glitz to our 
        idyllic small-town campus this weekend.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's student-run theater group will be staging its 
        production of As Bees In Honey Drown, written by Douglas Carter Beane, 
        this weekend, and the subject matter is enough to draw in the most reticent 
        of theatergoers. Evan Wyler is a young writer who has just begun to make 
        his way in the world of &quot;creative people,&quot; with its epicenter 
        in, of course, New York City. Evan is quickly pinned the hottest new player 
        on the scene and is on the verge of becoming certifiably famous--a real 
        member of the celebrity elite--when he receives a call from a mysterious 
        woman named Alexa Vere de Vere. Her precise role in this community of 
        artists is unknown: she seems to undertake the jobs of film and record 
        producer with equal aplomb, while also managing to have contacts with 
        most of Hollywood and the music and fashion worlds. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Alexa charms Evan into collaborating on a project with her, 
        and in the process takes him on a whirlwind tour of her lifestyle, complete 
        with the priciest hotels and resta&uacute;rants, the hippest clubs, and 
        the most outrageous people imaginable. However, Alexa has far more in 
        store for Evan than he can ever imagine, and our young writer is thrown 
        head first into a realm of seduction and trickery far beyond his grasp.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As if this snippet weren't tantalizing enough, Masque and 
        Gown's actual production of Bees is effortlessly smooth. The play is superbly 
        cast, featuring, among others, Sam Cohan '05 as the fresh-faced Evan Wyler, 
        Tara Morin '05 as the mysterious Alexa Vere de Vere, and Andrew Keshner 
        '03 as several lively characters, one of whom is a delightfully irate 
        British rocker. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Morin had only praise to give on the subject of the production: 
        &quot;Watching the piece come together over the last few weeks has been 
        exciting and rewarding. Everyone has put a great de&aacute;l of work into 
        the piece; director, cast, and crew alike&#133;the performance will be 
        a portrait of our dedication to the production.&quot; <br>
        Ian LeClair '02 is in the director's chair for the piece, a role he is 
        delighted to occupy. Said LeClair of his work on the project: &quot;In 
        thinking about the show what ended up being most important to me was the 
        truth of these characters' situations: dilemmas regarding identity, love, 
        deception&#133;What it means to have everything that you think is stable 
        in your life be suddenly put into doubt.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He was also enthusiastic about the effort of the cast and 
        crew: &quot;Everyone has worked so hard, and been so dedicated, and I 
        just can't give them enough credit. The show is really hard to put together&#133;I 
        think that's what makes it so exciting when it works&#133;the feeling 
        that despite all the obstacles and everything, we've really created something.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Bees in Honey Drown will be performed from Thursday to 
        Saturday at 8 p.m. in Wish Theater, with $1 tickets on sale at Smith Union 
        . </p>
