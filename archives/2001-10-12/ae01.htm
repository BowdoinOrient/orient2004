        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">A couple Fridays ago Everclear came to Bowdoin to play the 
        fall show in Morrell Gym. I had a chance to sit down with singer/songwriter 
        and bandleader Art Alexakis before the show, for an Orient exclusive interview. 
        The discussion ranged from the humorous to the serious, and Art showed 
        himself to be an intelligent and deeply concerned man, but also someone 
        who has not forgotten that he is a rock musician. He was an immediately 
        likeable and unassuming guy; surprisingly soft spoken and delicate in 
        his manner. Surprisingly short, he was dressed not like a 38 year old, 
        but wearing baggy khakis a ratty sweater and Vans sneakers. He did not 
        have any sort of &quot;rock star&quot; aura about him at all. He sat down 
        on a couch in a room across the hall from Morrell Gym, put his feet up 
        as we began our conversation.</p>
      <p><br>
        Orient: What bands and albums do you listen to, who are your influences, 
        and what bands do you draw your inspiration from?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Art Alexakis: Well, it depends on my moods, I have a lot of different 
        tastes, I guess Beatles are pretty much a constant. Lately I've been listening 
        to a lot of old country music, stuff I grew up with with my mom, and I 
        listen to a lot of classic rock. I don't really listen to a lot of new 
        music; it doesn't really strike me. I apologize if I seem really tired, 
        I've been on a flight all night and it's not for any other reason, I just 
        haven't had any sleep.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: No problem. What is it about new music that doesn't hit you as hard 
        as the stuff you listen to?<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: I think everyone just sounds the same. It looks like a huge multi-million 
        dollar game of follow the leader. You know. Everybody's trying to sound 
        like everybody else or look like everybody else. It's very depressing, 
        but I don't think it's gonna last, I think it's a phase, cause I think&#133;like 
        with the eighties with all the metal bands, and then something like Nirvana 
        came along and opened the door for a lot of bands such as ourselves. People 
        called it alternative rock, but I didn't think it was alternative. It 
        was just rock and roll. And I think that's on a comeback and I'm looking 
        forward to that.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: I was just listening to your soundcheck and you really showed a diverse 
        range of music. As Everclear has grown as a band, it what ways do you 
        think your sound has changed?<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Well, you know, when Everclear started, I had just moved to Portland, 
        and had been living in Portland for a little less than a year. I had a 
        brand new baby and was living on welfare, I couldn't find a job in Portland, 
        so I was very angry, and the music on our first album really reflects 
        that. I think that now I'm still angry, but in different ways. In one 
        way that's really different, and that's feeling more empowered because 
        I've done something and achieved goals. That makes you feel a lot more 
        empowered, setting goals and achieving them. But at the time, all the 
        music that influences or are coming out in Everclear have always been 
        there, they've always been things I've wanted to do, I just didn't feel 
        confident enough in my capabilities and in our capabilities as a band. 
        We feel stronger as a band and we feel like taking more of a leap, and 
        getting in touch with things that we've always loved, such as R&amp;B 
        and pop, country, folk, and still Rock &amp; Roll. My favorite bands like 
        the Beatles, they never made records like they're making today that all 
        sound the same, all the songs sound the same. It's like bands that say 
        they are punk rock, the kids in the band weren't even born when punk rock 
        came out. Had came and went, and now it's being brought back. To me punk 
        rock never went away, because it's not about playing three chords real 
        hard and fast, it's about your attitude you know? Fucking things up. Can 
        I say that?<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: Yeah, I think so. It's a college paper. <br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: There you go.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: I was reading an interview with you in Guitar World, and you were 
        talking about studio work. You seem to be really into the recording aspect 
        and getting everything just right. But also, elsewhere you were talking 
        about how you love to play live shows. Which do you find more rewarding? 
        Or is it different? Which do you enjoy more?<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Well, I'm in the studio right now producing another band, and I really 
        like starting with an idea and watching it build and turn into a song, 
        you know, I love that about recording. Live is a very, you know, more 
        two or three-dimensional thing. When you make a recording you can put 
        stuff in there and get more and more out of it every time you listen to 
        it. Live it's just this one immediate thing, and you're in this zone playing, 
        and that's very exhilarating and intoxicating. I don't do drugs or drink, 
        I haven't in many years, but it's similar that buzz&#133;when you're connected. 
        When you're a fan of someone and you see it live it's just like [makes 
        amazed facial expression]. I still feel like that, I went and saw Aerosmith 
        on this tour they're doing, and met the guys backstage which was so cool, 
        and watching them play songs, they played some new songs that I'm not 
        too familiar with, but then they played stuff from the first four or five 
        albums that I grew up with. They were like my banner. Them and Rush and 
        Zeppelin and Sabbath, but Aerosmith and Rush were like my favorite bands, 
        and Cheap Trick when they came out too. It's just exciting. Cheap Trick, 
        same example, I got to play; we played with Rick Neilsen and Robin Zander. 
        They got up and did Surrender with us at this movie premiere and it was 
        just..we played hard and fast. Robin Zander was like, 'that is the hardest 
        and the loudest and the fastest that song has ever been played. That's 
        how it should have been recorded.' So, it was pretty cool.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: You've spent a lot of time working with social issues, and you address 
        them both in your songs and other actions, such as going to Capital Hill, 
        and being involved in ACES, a child support enforcement program. While 
        all of that is very admirable and is doing a lot of good, do you ever 
        feel like, for example with Pearl Jam and Ticketmaster. You can't really 
        write an article about them without mentioning Ticketmaster. Do you feel 
        that way about your social involvement?<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Well, you know, I've got my own opinions on that, and I'm not one 
        to ever bad talk other bands or criticize anyone. I think they did it 
        to break a monopoly that wasn't going to be broken, and the people that 
        suffered in the end, I mean the band suffered financially, but the people 
        that really suffered were all their fans who didn't get to see them for 
        all those years. They would only do sporadic shows without Ticketmaster. 
        And I was just like cut the crap guys, you're a rock band. Get out and 
        play your music and work a deal with Ticketmaster that they give so much 
        money to charity or something, I mean Ticketmaster would have done that 
        to avoid that thing, cause they weren't sure they were going to win that 
        whole thing, which they did. Sometimes you got to lose a battle and win 
        the war, but I see where you're going with your question. I don't think 
        I've let anything I believe in or the band believes in to get in the way 
        of the music, and hopefully it never will. I've never heard anyone come 
        up to me and say 'oh you're that band that did that thing on Capital Hill.' 
        It hasn't gotten to that yet, and there are still things I want to do 
        for that organization and for other organizations. But it's about when 
        you're doing well and you have extra: When you have plenty you should 
        spread it around. Ultimately what comes first is my family and secondly 
        my work and when those things are in tune then I feel happy as a person, 
        and I believe that everyone's happiness is pretty much&#133;when you're 
        honestly happy, not selfishly happy. It's not about material wealth or 
        the chicks or drugs or anything like that, but when you feel focused as 
        a person you're gonna fit into society better. The happier that we can 
        all make each other and still pull together and work together as a team, 
        like this country has a lot in the last two weeks. [referring to the events 
        of Sept 11.] I've been very amazed. But now I'm starting to hear that 
        [Muslim people] are getting beat up in small towns, and that's just missing 
        the whole point. It's like putting the Japanese in camps during World 
        War II. These people are here because they want to be Americans, you know, 
        Arab-Americans, German-Americans, and that's what makes our country awesome.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: You perfectly anticipated my next question. What do you think about 
        the political atmosphere in America today? <br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Well, to be perfectly frank with you, it makes me a little nervous. 
        I mean, when this thing happened; make no illusions, our whole world has 
        changed. Economists are now saying 'yes we are in a recession' whereas 
        two weeks ago they weren't saying that. I was looking at the economic 
        indicators and I was looking at the stock market and saying this is nuts.. 
        I am just amazed that this attack didn't drive us even farther into what 
        could possibly be a depression. I mean, if our dollar gets devalued, people 
        don't want to buy our dollar like they did two weeks ago. It's not strong 
        anymore, it's medium to weak and when it gets weak, then our country goes 
        into a depression. And that's when the rest of the world goes into a depression. 
        The American dollar is the closest thing we have to a standard currency 
        throughout the world. It's stronger than the pound, the yen, whatever. 
        The weird thing about economics is that it's not just based on pragmatic 
        stuff, it's based on what people think about the future, and speculation. 
      </p>
      <p>But getting, this is a roundabout answer for your question, getting back 
        to the whole political thing, I'm all for supporting the President, although 
        I don't fully believe he was rightfully elected the President of these 
        country, but he is the President good or bad and I support him. But there's 
        weird things going on with Executive Orders. There are challenges to the 
        first and fourth amendments that we need to really be cognizant of and 
        not get blinded by the love of our wonderful country and of our flag, 
        but still be able to say hey, yeah let's punish the people that did wrong, 
        let's do what we need to do, I'm behind you there, but don't take away 
        my rights, even for a day. That's what I'm scared of. And I mean, well, 
        I'm liberal to a sense but I'm not a card-carrying member of the ACLU. 
        I do believe there's times when our civil liberties need to be suspended 
        for the public good, that's fine, for a short amount of time. But sweeping 
        executive orders that change lives are unacceptable. Do you know what 
        I mean? </p>
      <p>So it makes me a little frightened and it makes me wonder what's gonna 
        happen. Wartime changes culture. It changes movies it changes music. A 
        lot of the bands out there are what I call cookie monster bands. These 
        loud new metal bands that are angry, but they aren't really angry about 
        anything specifically, they're just pissed off. And I understand kids 
        identifying with that because when you're a teenager you're just pissed 
        off. Even kids from really good families with great parents are going 
        'god no one understand me.' Yeah, cause you're a fucking kid. Don't take 
        yourself so seriously. Go have a good time. I just wonder if these bands 
        are going to kind of get swept away because I think now people are going 
        to want a connection. It could be like after World War II, when everyone 
        was all ra ra ra, which I think this administration wants. Or it might 
        go like Vietnam when we had protest songs, and the pop music was very 
        sugary to counterbalance that, or it might be something of its own making. 
        It's all exciting, but with that excitement there's a little bit of danger, 
        so I'm just kind of waiting to see what will happen. I'm almost forty 
        and I've seen a lot of shit in my life, and I think we're in a time where; 
        we might be in this war for; how old are you?<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: 20<br>
        AA: You're draft age.</p>
      <p>[At this point the other members of the band entered the room and started 
        making loud yelling noises...and the interview slowly began to spiral 
        out of this intrepid reporter's control]<br>
      </p>
      <p>Craig Montoya [Bass Player]: Sorry are we interrupting?<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: No problem.<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: So what time's dinner served?<br>
      </p>
      <p>CM: one hour<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA Really? they told me 5:30.<br>
      </p>
      <p>CM: I don't know I heard 6:00.<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Ok, I'm with you fellars. [Art looks back at me and starts talking] 
        These college shows are always funny because it's like you're playing 
        a sock hop in gym. You're always in a gymnasium, with just college kids. 
        It's kind of a weird attitude but when the lights go down it's cool.<br>
      </p>
      <p>[A lot of people come from the surrounding area too, teenagers and older 
        people.]<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Oh, cool. [Art looks up at a picture of a softball player and motions 
        toward the word Bowdoin emblazoned across the front.] How do you say it? 
        Bode-win?<br>
      </p>
      <p>O: Bo-din<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: [he practices the pronunciation several times] Bo-din. Bo-din. [He 
        indicates to the deli tray] Is there tuna salad over there?<br>
      </p>
      <p>CM: There is not, there is ham, roast beef, and turkey.<br>
      </p>
      <p>AA: Bo-din.</p>
