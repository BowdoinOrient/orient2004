      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin has recently become the third college in Maine with 
        an on-campus Habitat for Humanity charter. Popularized by former U.S. 
        President Jimmy Carter, Habitat for Humanity International was founded 
        twenty-five years ago in Georgia. Originally a Christian movement, Habitat 
        has since built over 100,000 homes worldwide for underprivileged families. 
        It ranks among America's most popular charities. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After gaining the charter, the group is now ready to move 
        forward under the moniker, &quot;Bear Hands,&quot; seeking to build its 
        first house here in Brunswick. However, as the group has begun planning 
        for the project, dubbed &quot;Bowdoin Builds,&quot; it has become clear 
        that several needs must be met in the immediate future if the house is 
        to be constructed by the spring target date. An obvious obstacle lies 
        in the acquisition of funds for materials for the house; Bear Hands is 
        estimating that $40,000 is necessary. Several fundraisers are planned, 
        all of which require additional volunteers. The group plans to sell buttons 
        during Parents' Weekend and is also sponsoring a massage session at Baxter 
        House in the near future. Furthermore, t-shirts will be sold to raise 
        money during Homecoming. Several other events are currently being planned, 
        including an on-campus ice cream toss in the Smith Union organized in 
        conjunction with the first-year student officers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of this will be in vain, however, until a suitable piece 
        of land is located for the house. &quot;We're hoping either for a donation 
        or for someone to bring an inexpensive piece of property to our attention,&quot; 
        said student co-chair Claire Black, '04, in a press release. For this 
        reason, Bear Hands is working with the Brunswick/Bath affiliate of Habitat 
        to acquire property near campus. This will be difficult since open space 
        in the Brunswick area is quite scarce, according to group press correspondent 
        Sue Danforth.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond monetary and physical needs, the group is seeking 
        volunteers to add to the over 100 students that have expressed interest 
        thus far. Beyond simply assisting the group with the actual construction 
        of the house, there are committee posts open, and new ideas are welcome 
        and needed. &quot;What we really need,&quot; said Black, &quot;is for 
        all students to support the fundraisers we have coming. It would be great 
        if students bought shirts and during Homecoming donated their spare change 
        in Penny Wars.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin Builds is a unique project, representing students, 
        faculty, and administrators here. Despite this, the direction of the group 
        is certainly in the hands of the students involved. While the freshman 
        student officers are pledging their class' time and effort to the project, 
        more unilateral support is needed. &quot;The enthusiasm on campus for 
        this project has been striking,&quot; said committee co-chair Professor 
        Tricia Welsch. This is a perfect example, an ideal opportunity for all 
        members of Bowdoin's community to contribute to the Common Good of their 
        community. Those interested can contact the group at <a href="mailto:habitat@bowdoin.edu">habitat@bowdoin.edu</a> 
        or at extension 5462, or can email Lydia Bell at <a href="mailto:lbell2@bowdoin.edu">lbell2@bowdoin.edu</a>.<br>
