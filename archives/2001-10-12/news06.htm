        <font size="2">ANJALI DOTSON<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">Academic dishonesty. This catch phrase has demanded a lot 
        of attention from the Bowdoin community in recent years. According to 
        the Annual Reports to the Community from the 1998-99, 1999-00, and 2000-01 
        academic years, the Judicial Board heard 3, 14, and 13 academic cases, 
        respectively. Although these statistics suggest a rise in academic dishonesty 
        in the last three years, there is more to be considered than meets the 
        eye.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the September 25, 1998 issue of the Orient, an article 
        entitled &quot;Judicial Board decisions come under fire&quot; brought 
        up issues including &quot;leniency, consistency, and standards,&quot; 
        with Mathematics Professor Bill Barker expressing serious concerns about 
        the &quot;effectiveness of the J-Board,&quot; claiming, along with many 
        other faculty, that the sanctions were too light to stamp out or even 
        discourage academic dishonesty. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the last three years, Barker has noticed a striking transformation 
        in the way the J-Board operates. Philosophy professor Dennis Corish has 
        been serving on the Board for about six years, and has also witnessed 
        the changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The Board has been working under a tougher set of 
        rules than it used to. At one time the Board was thought by many of the 
        faculty to be too lenient. That, I think, is not the perception now,&quot; 
        Corish said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dean Bradley agrees, and noted that &quot;having an established 
        honor code matters. There has been an increased awareness of the centrality 
        of academic dishonesty at Bowdoin on the part of students and faculty. 
        That's why sanctions are tough-this is a central rule.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, the function of the Honor Code as a vital aspect 
        of the college community is not an idea limited to Bowdoin. In three national 
        surveys conducted by Don McCabe, the founder and first president of the 
        Center of Academic Integrity, academic honor codes &quot;effectively reduced 
        cheating&quot; on college campuses. The surveys, conducted in 1990, 1995, 
        and 1999 including over 12,000 students at 48 colleges, showed that serious 
        test cheating was one third to one half lower at colleges with honor codes 
        than those without honor codes. Similar results were obtained regarding 
        serious cheating on written assignments. (The survey results are posted 
        on the Duke University Kenan Institute for Ethics website.)*<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Clearly, honor codes are effective in reducing academic 
        dishonesty, but there are still students consistently exhibiting academic 
        dishonesty. Barker feels the true disservice is to the students who choose 
        not to cheat. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;When I bring a charge, I'm thinking that I'm doing 
        it for the students. They are the ones who've been offended. It's helping 
        to protect honest students from those who are not,&quot; Barker said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fortunately, amongst most faculty, the occasional dishonest 
        student has not compromised the intrinsic trust between the student and 
        professor.<br>
        &quot;We trust people and that's proper, until something blatant happens. 
        The vast majority of students at Bowdoin don't cheat,&quot; Corish said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, when the question of academic dishonesty does arise, 
        it often proves to be a time-consuming process. Therefore, there are numerous 
        reasons why professors hesitate in bringing cases forward. Barker points 
        out that &quot;a lot of faculty can't stomach the idea of suspension,&quot; 
        and that others &quot;just don't care that much, and don't want to deal 
        with it.&quot; In past years, these factors, paired with a weak judicial 
        system, created an atmosphere of leniency, as illustrated by the few number 
        of academic cases (3) heard by the Board during the 1998-99 academic year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, the question stands: Has the number of reported cases 
        risen as a result of an increase in academic dishonesty or simply a boost 
        in the confidence professors have in the renovated system? Tara Talbot, 
        Chair of the Judicial Board, gives a simple explanation:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I believe that there has been an increase in reported 
        cases, not necessarily actual occurrences. I think that this is a result 
        of a fair, thoughtful, and consistent Judicial Board process that has 
        only existed at Bowdoin for three years. As professors gain more trust 
        for the judicial process, they are more likely to take cases to the Board 
        instead of dealing with them privately. Thus, in a strangely ironic way, 
        I see the increase in reported academic dishonesty cases as a positive 
        thing,&quot; Talbot said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, it does appear that at least some faculty members 
        have developed a higher trust in the workings of the Board.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There is a growing confidence and support for the 
        academic Honor Code at Bowdoin. The J-Board has done a very good job of 
        explaining types of cases to the community and, to a degree, educating 
        students and faculty. This demystifies what goes on in the J-Board and 
        that builds confidence,&quot; Dean Bradley said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Asian Studies professor Henry Laurence is a strong advocate 
        of the revamped J-Board and confirms that confidence among many professors 
        is on the rise.<br>
        &quot;In my opinion, the reputation of the J-Board has soared among many 
        of the faculty as a result of Mya Mangawang's superb leadership and the 
        clear commitment of the members of the Board. Thus, many more faculty 
        are bringing cases, confident that the process will now be both fair and 
        effective at defending and upholding standards of academic honesty,&quot; 
        Laurence said. Yet, unfortunately, he notes the opposite phenomenon occurring, 
        as well. &quot;I still know a lot of senior faculty that won't bring cases 
        to the J-Board. A lot of faculty would prefer to do it 'in house,' but 
        I don't think they realized that by doing that they were creating an environment 
        in which cheating was rampant.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Talbot strongly discourages professors from handling possible 
        violations on their own, because this method does not provide Bowdoin 
        students with an &quot;equal playing field.&quot; Film Studies professor 
        Tricia Welsch took this fact into consideration and chose to take her 
        case to the Board. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;My experience with the J-Board was very positive. 
        Everybody was treated very fairly and with respect. It was a wrenching 
        experience, but as bad experiences go, it was a good one,&quot; Welsch 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In connection with the Board's more careful and unyielding 
        attitude towards academic dishonesty, trust in the system has resulted 
        in more cases being reported. There is a general consensus among those 
        interviewed, that academic dishonesty itself is not on the rise. Laurence, 
        having taken five cases to the Board for review, noted a difference in 
        the type of dishonesty occurring in the past compared with what he sees 
        now.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I doubt very much that there's been a rise [in academic 
        dishonesty], because the cases I got when I first came to Bowdoin were&#133;a 
        very crude kind of plagiarism. I don't see the blatant kind [of dishonesty] 
        anymore, and I suspect it has to do with the J-Board's new function on 
        campus,&quot; Laurence said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When Laurence arrived five years ago, he observed that there 
        were &quot;definitely groups of people on campus for whom cheating was 
        a way of life. In certain sections of the community including a few fraternities 
        and some sports teams, it appeared that there was a culture of dishonesty.&quot; 
        Laurence acknowledges that he is unsure whether this is happening now, 
        but attributes the more blatant cheating of past years to this &quot;culture 
        of dishonesty.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, regardless of the type of environment created by 
        outside factors, it still remains the students' responsibility to be honest 
        and trustworthy.<br>
        &quot;You learn so much by doing the research and developing your own 
        ideas. To just copy undermines the whole purpose of being here. The discipline 
        of writing a paper, having to put together a coherent argument&#133;is 
        the aspect of what it is to get a liberal arts education,&quot; Dean Bradley 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The issue of academic honesty and integrity is being brought 
        to the forefront by faculty and students alike and is demanding the attention 
        of every member of the Bowdoin community.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It seems to me that there is a growing consensus on 
        this campus of who we are and who we want to become in terms of standards. 
        Values have been set and the community is working together through the 
        Board and other institutions to see them through,&quot; Hilburn said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Adjusting and modifying traditions is never easy, as Mangawang 
        and members of the Board can verify. Yet a gradual evolution with the 
        support of the entire community has allowed the positive changes to take 
        effect. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I believe that the Board must be sure that their 'housekeeping 
        is sacred and honorable' and that at every turn their findings uphold 
        our community standards,&quot; Mangawang said. &quot;In doing so, I believe 
        that the J-Board maintains a distinct capacity to 'raise and inspire' 
        the community towards preserving Bowdoin as a place of the utmost honesty 
        and respect.&quot;</p>
