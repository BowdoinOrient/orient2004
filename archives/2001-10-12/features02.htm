        You have no doubt heard that the U.S. economy is in recession. The obvious 
        questions are: Why? What is to be done? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The U.S. economy in the late 1990's can best be described 
        as a &quot;bubble economy.&quot; Stock prices increased far beyond levels 
        justified by economic potential. The &quot;bubble&quot; in prices was, 
        of course, most spectacular in the technology sector with wealth, on paper, 
        being created at an astonishing rate. But in a capitalist economy, the 
        prices of financial assets direct the creation of productive capacity. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When the prices of particular assets, for example, tech 
        stocks, rise to excessive levels, too large a portion of society's scarce 
        savings is allocated to expansion of the affected sector. Unwarranted 
        business creation and growth become the order of the day. Afraid of being 
        left behind, even established, conservative corporations overinvest in 
        the &quot;hot&quot; sector. Talk is of a &quot;new economy,&quot; within 
        which the old rules of economics no longer apply.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Eventually, prudence re-emerges, the &quot;bubble&quot; 
        bursts, and we awaken to the reality that, over a period of years, a significant 
        quantity of resources has been wasted. Financing opportunities that would 
        have enhanced society's productive capacity have been bypassed in favor 
        of the more fashionable &quot;bubble&quot; sector. Human resources have 
        been devoted to ultimately unproductive pursuits. The consequence is that 
        society's productive capacity is lower than it could have been, and the 
        economy must endure a substantive, time-consuming, and painful reallocation 
        of resources.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some businesses fail, others need only to downsize. Also, 
        to the extent they indulged in fashionable over-investment, companies, 
        even those businesses with strong ongoing business prospects, find retrenchment 
        a necessity. This process manifests itself through a dramatic decline 
        in business investment, 10-15 percent in the current case, resulting in 
        a decline in the economy's level of production. Of course, it is also 
        necessary to reallocate workers, which takes time. As this occurs, unemployment 
        rises above its long-run sustainable level. In a word: recession.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Seven decades ago, commentators would have said that a recession 
        was necessary to purge the excesses from the system, a reckoning, if you 
        will. A more modern, less judgmental statement might be that a recession 
        is a nearly inevitable consequence of the reallocation of resources necessitated 
        by the deflation of a major &quot;bubble.&quot; It is important to understand 
        that there is little that can, or should, be done to curtail this economic 
        adjustment. What should be done has been done.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In response to similar episodes in the past, society introduced 
        economic institutions that prevented temporary disruptions of economic 
        activity (like the current recession) from escalating into deep depression. 
        Under normal circumstances, only additional policy actions, designed to 
        reduce the pain foisted upon individuals as the necessary adjustment occurs, 
        would be appropriate.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, the events of September 11th and the emerging war 
        have the potential to complicate matters. The consumer psychology, partly 
        responsible for the &quot;bubble economy&quot; of the 90's, can also work 
        in the reverse direction. Consumers may react to fears of additional terrorist 
        attacks by dramatically curtailing their spending for a substantial period 
        of time. This would cause business in some sectors to contract more than 
        is required by the deflation of the economic &quot;bubble.&quot; The ultimate 
        severity of the recession and timing of the recovery will, therefore, 
        depend upon how consumer psychology evolves over the next few months.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Consumer psychology can be manipulated. As government leaders 
        devise policies to assist those affected by the recession, they also are 
        attempting to identify policies that will restore consumer confidence, 
        and, presumably, the willingness to spend. These proposals will include 
        some combination of increased government spending and tax cuts.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As long as the actions taken have only a short-term negative 
        effect on the government's finances, they likely will be harmless and 
        may even achieve the desired results, leading to a quicker recovery. However, 
        if policy-makers implement proposals with negative long-term effects on 
        the government's finances, future economic performance will be harmed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Recognizing that the current economic situation is a temporary, 
        albeit painful, period in our history, is the prerequisite for a wise 
        governmental and, more broadly, societal response.</p>
