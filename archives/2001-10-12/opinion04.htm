      <p align="left"><font size="5">When Harry met Sally at the Polar Bear: Bowdoin men and women</font><br>
        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font><font size="2"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;You realize, of course, that we can never be friends.&quot;-Harry<br>
        &quot;Why not?&quot;-Sally<br>
        &quot;What I'm saying is; and this is not a come on in any way, shape 
        or form; is that men and women can't be friends because the sex part always 
        gets in the way.&quot;<br>
        &quot;That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there is no 
        sex involved.&quot;<br>
        &quot;No you don't&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yes I do&quot;<br>
        &quot;No you don't. You only think you do.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We've all seen the movie a hundred times. We know by heart 
        how Harry met Sally driving to New York, how they hated each other, met 
        again on a plane, still hated each other, met again in a bookstore, became 
        friends and ultimately fell in love and got married. It's wonderful and 
        heart-warming and we smile every time. But under the smile our thoughts 
        race: &quot;Which one of my friends will I fall in love with and end up 
        marrying?&quot; &quot;Of course I'll marry her.&quot; &quot;I could never 
        fall in love with him.&quot; In the day and age of co-ed colleges with 
        men and women living next door to each other, every one of us has our 
        &quot;best guy friend&quot; and &quot;best girl friend&quot; regardless 
        of whether or not we have girlfriends or boyfriends. But how big is the 
        distinction, actually? Are we secretly in love with (or lust after) our 
        friends of the opposite gender, if we are heterosexual, or can we feel 
        the same way about them as we do our same-sex friends? Which leads to 
        the paradox of Harry and Sally that I investigate this week: CAN MEN AND 
        WOMEN EVER REALLY BE JUST FRIENDS??<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There seem to be some opposing views on this question: sort 
        of, yes, and no. Women, in general fall into the first two categories, 
        while men, though represented in all three, make up the largest percentage 
        of the latter.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"> The &quot;sort of&quot; belief goes something like this: 
        there will always be sexual tension between friends of opposite sexes 
        but it can be put aside and a friendship can exist. Charlotte said to 
        me recently, &quot;That's half the fun of guy friends! I love flirting 
        with them and knowing nothing will happen!&quot; This assumes that there 
        is no other way to see someone of the opposite sex than romantically. 
        But that this makes the friendship fun and different than those with same-sex 
        friends. Beth rationalizes it as such: &quot;People like to surround themselves 
        with the kind of people they want to be and want to be with. Therefore 
        they are attracted (friends-wise) to the same people they are attracted 
        to sexually and romantically.&quot; But this is not to say that the sexual 
        attraction may not be addressed and then moved past. &quot;I haven't had 
        a friendship with a guy without having a talk where we establish that 
        nothing's going to happen,&quot; says Megan, &quot;but then we can go 
        on to be real friends.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another facet of this is that men and women can be platonic 
        if one or both of them are &quot;off-limits.&quot; Harry sees this in 
        When Harry Met Sally and amends his previous statement to allow for men 
        and women to be friends if and only if they are both attached. There is 
        no chance for the sexual tension to amount to anything anyway, so the 
        friendship can progress without worry. Carrie commented, &quot;I would 
        say that many of my best friends in the world are male, and I have no 
        plans for romance with any of them. But most of them are practically married 
        and the ones that aren't now at least were when we became close.&quot; 
        To Carrie, I pose the question, what happens if these so-called platonic 
        best friends suddenly are no longer off-limits? Would she all of a sudden 
        &quot;discover&quot; that she is attracted to them and that she has repressed 
        these feelings because she knew nothing could come of them? She replied, 
        &quot;I don't think so. But I guess that's part of the excitement of the 
        friendship, you know?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some would say that she never had these feelings in the 
        first place. For instance, my professor, Jean Yarbrough, of the Government 
        Department (that's her real name-she told me I could use it), said that 
        men and women can absolutely be friends without any sort of sexual tension. 
        Women are not attracted to every man they meet and vice versa. So of course 
        friendships can develop. Friendship is an attraction of the mind and therefore 
        men and women are attracted to each other as well as to people of the 
        same sex in that they are attracted to their minds and nothing more. A 
        guy and a girl may be friends all their life, single and attached and 
        never even want to sleep together. Will agrees, &quot;Yeah, definitely.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Polar opposite (no pun intended) is Paul who quickly replied 
        to my question with an &quot;Absolutely not.&quot; He elaborated, &quot;If 
        a guy is willing to put that much effort into any woman, excluding mothers 
        and sisters, he is hoping to sleep with her, whether now or later.&quot; 
        This is supported by the theory that there is always the physical possibility 
        that a man and a woman could actually sleep together. So that a female 
        friend is closer to something a man would be attracted to than his male 
        friends. There is something intrinsically different and female about all 
        women that men are attracted to and all women will have that at some level. 
        Therefore, at some point, a man will realize that this girl who he spends 
        so much time with is a female and, like, whoa, they could actually&#133;have&#133;sex! 
        Kitty confides that she knows that she keeps many of her male friends 
        because she is aware of sexual tension and uses it to her advantage-she 
        is sure that men and women can't be friends without it and so she embraces 
        it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This leads me to wonder about how gay, lesbian and bisexual 
        men and women feel. I wonder if a gay man can ever really be friends with 
        another gay man or even another straight man without feelings getting 
        in the way. If this it is really impossible to be friends with someone 
        of the gender you are attracted to, then can bisexuals ever have any real 
        friends at all? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I realize that the Harry and Sally Paradox will never be 
        truly resolved, for feelings can change in seconds and circumstances affect 
        everything anyway. But for now I'll dismiss those who say &quot;absolutely&quot; 
        as deluded and those who say &quot;absolutely not&quot; as over-sexed 
        and close-minded. Rather I will agree with the &quot;sort-of&quot;s who 
        seem to understand that each and every friendship is unique and based 
        on the chemistry that develops between people, whether they are of the 
        same or opposite genders. It appears that men and women can, in fact, 
        be platonic friends; at the same time, it is possible for friends to be 
        attracted to each other and remain friends with no intention of acting 
        upon that attraction. So that a straight woman can love her best guy friend 
        just as she loves her best girl friends but have a hidden longing to sleep 
        with different guy friend and one day want to marry a third. In the end, 
        just keep 'em all around-you'll need someone to take to the Spring Gala 
        (or a New Year's Party, if you happen to be Sally Albright) if you aren't 
        attached or your significant other can't go anyway.<br>
