      <p>The Bowdoin Women's Field Hockey squad has been busy recently, with four 
        wins in five games. The Bears stand at 10-2 overall and were ranked 14th 
        in the DIII NCAA poll this week.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On September 29, Bowdoin faced a tough matchup in Amherst. After eight 
        minutes elapsed, a scramble in front of the Bear box led to the game's 
        only goal. <br>

      <p>Sophomores Gillian McDonald and Kristin Pollock shared time in net during 
        the second half to hold the Jeffs from scoring again. &quot;The NESCAC 
        is so unpredictable this year that we cannot look past any games,&quot; 
        said McDonald.<br>
        The Bears turned things around the following week. Last Tuesday, Bowdoin 
        faced the University of Southern Maine. Pollock started her first game 
        of the season and finished a 2-0 shutout win over the Huskies. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Only four minutes into the game, the Bears scored on a corner. Jackie 
        Templeton '03 fired a shot that was tipped in by Leah McClure '03.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The score remained at 1-0 into the second half of play. Co-captain Allison 
        Scaduto '02 assisted a Marissa O'Neil '05 goal with about 20 minutes left 
        to play in the game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin pressured the Huskies with seven shots on goal, and Pollock made 
        one save in the shutout. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The field hockey women didn't slow down after the victory as they geared 
        up for a double-header on Fall Break weekend. Traveling to Tufts on Saturday 
        and then further south to Trinity on Sunday, the Bears were able to add 
        two more wins to their record.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In a game of NESCAC rivals, the women pulled a 1-0 win over the Tufts 
        Jumbos. The game began during a torrential downpour, but McClure still 
        managed to score the matchup's only goal. &quot;Amanda Burrage initiated 
        the goal when she creamed a shot from the top of the circle,&quot; Templeton 
        said. &quot;It bounced on the line, until Leah tipped it in.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin women gave another strong performance on Sunday, and came 
        out on top of Trinity 2-1. The Bantams scored early in the game, but the 
        Bears soon were on the board with a goal from O'Neil, assisted by captain 
        Heather Nicholson '02.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The game remained tied through the rest of regulation, even after Bowdoin 
        had pressured Trinity goaltender Jessica Martin with 26 shots. Four minutes 
        into overtime play, sophomore Burrage brought Bowdoin the win off a pass 
        from Templeton.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We went into the six-a-side sudden-death overtime&#133;when I rebounded 
        the ball off the goalie's pads and reverse-sticked it to Amanda, she saw 
        the perfect angle into the goal.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the latest Bear action, the field hockey women conquered the University 
        of Maine Farmington last Wednesday. Ryan Field hosted a scoreless game 
        through the first half, but at the beginning of the game's second frame, 
        Templeton made an unassisted goal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Only two minutes later, during a penalty corner, an O'Neil-Scaduto play 
        set up a shot for Templeton, who scored again. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Farmington was unable to hit the Bear net, and the game finished with 
        a 2-0 score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin faces Connecticut College in a home game tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. 
        &quot;This weekend, we play Conn College, and they are going to be tough,&quot; 
        said McDonald. &quot;We just have to come out strong and play our game.&quot;<br>
