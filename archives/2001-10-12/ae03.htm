        <font size="2">JIM FLANAGAN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>If you are looking for something to do with your parents this weekend, 
        why not bring them to a free, critically acclaimed movie? All four films 
        this weekend are in celebration of National Coming Out Day. In addition, 
        the acclaimed National Geographic filmmaker Mick Davie will be giving 
        a lecture and screening some of his work on Sunday night. All these events 
        are in Smith Auditorium in Sills Hall and are free and open to everyone.</p>
      <p>Being John Malkovich - Friday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        This truly unique film from the minds of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman 
        answer the question &quot;What would it be like to be somebody else?&quot; 
        Craig (John Cusack) discovers a way for anyone to become John Malkovich, 
        and soon becomes obsessed, as does his wife Lotte and his coworker Maxine. 
        By including John Malkovich (who really was a sport for letting this film 
        be made), you get the oddest love rectangle ever formed. This is a film 
        not to be missed.</p>
      <p>Paragraph 175 - Friday at 9:00 p.m.<br>
        This is a great documentary from the Oscar winning team of Robert Epstein 
        and Jeffery Friedman. Paragraph 175 was a law passed in Nazi Germany that 
        outlawed homosexual relationships. Gay men were hunted and killed much 
        like those of the Jewish faith, yet their story goes largely untold. It 
        is narrated by Rupert Everett and won the Director's Award as the best 
        documentary at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival.</p>
      <p>But I'm a Cheerleader - Saturday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        This film, starring Natasha Lyonne, offers a satire about homophobia. 
        Megan's parents suspect her of having homosexual tendencies and send her 
        to a special camp which will &quot;make her straight.&quot; This only 
        causes her to become even more curious as to what she actually desires.</p>
      <p>Mansfield Park - Saturday at 9:00 p.m.<br>
        I have neither seen this film nor read the Jane Austen novel on which 
        it is based, so I really don't know how much this film deals with gay 
        issues. However, I can tell you that the director and screenwriter, Patricia 
        Rozema, is an openly gay filmmaker whose previous films have dealt frankly 
        with lesbian characters and issues. We hope that you enjoy this film and 
        will be inspired to seek out more of Rozema's work.</p>
      <p>Mick Davie - Sunday at 7:30 p.m.<br>
        Mick Davie, a filmmaker for National Geographic, will show parts of three 
        of his films: Cape Town to Cairo, War Child, and Honor Among Men: the 
        Killing of Women in Pakistan. Each film will feature a question and answer 
        session, and after all films have been presented, he will lead an in-depth 
        discussion about the films' issues. In light of recent changes in US-Afghanistan 
        relations, Mick's films and knowledge about that region should make for 
        a very interesting evening.</p>
