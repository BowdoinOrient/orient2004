        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>When you're the Bowdoin Football Team and you've been outscored 69-0 
        in the past two games, you look for small details to convince yourself 
        that next weekend will be better. This weekend, the team will return to 
        the comfortable confines of Whittier Field, whose bleachers will hold 
        a large contingent of players' families on Parents Weekend. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This support will be important during a point in the season when players 
        are trying to fight the negative emotions associated with an 0-3 start. 
        &quot;The players are all disappointed after Saturday [against Tufts],&quot; 
        said head coach Dave Caputi. &quot;It's taken us a while to get back, 
        but I think we're prepared [for tomorrow].&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the things Caputi mentioned was his team's inability to capitalize 
        after long drives. Last Saturday, a 15-play drive was squandered and didn't 
        yield any points for the Polar Bears. &quot;For a team as young as we 
        are, we need to finish those drives,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A blocked Bear punt in the first quarter yielded Tufts' first touchdown. 
        The Jumbos then scored on drives of 19 and 17 yards, pushing the score 
        to 20-0. Two additional touchdowns would round out the scoring and complete 
        a 34-0 loss for the Polar Bears. Running back Keven Kelley scored three 
        of five Jumbo touchdowns on 21 carries, tallying 89 yards. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Junior quarterback Justin Hardison completed 11 of 28 passes for 76 yards. 
        Kevin Bougie '04 led Bowdoin's running game with 51 yards on 19 carries.<br>
        Youth has proved both useful and detrimental in the 2001 season. Mistakes 
        caused by inexperience have cost the team during games, but key contributions 
        have also been made by underclassmen. Against Tufts, first year Brian 
        Durant led the team in receptions, making three catches for 29 yards. 
        Wide receiver Dan Foley '05 has also been coming along well, according 
        to Caputi. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Upperclassmen combined with younger players on the defensive end in the 
        Tufts matchup. Jeb Bodreau '04, Travis Cummings '02, Jesse Demers '05, 
        and Andrius Knasas '02 combined to make 30 tackles.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Injuries have depleted the Polar Bear roster, resulting in a loss of 
        senior leadership. Brett Bowen '02, who Caputi called, &quot;one of the 
        top five wideouts in the league,&quot; is out for the season with chronic 
        knee problems. Fellow senior Eric Morin, who had been having shoulder 
        trouble, had barely returned to action before injuring his ankle.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite a rough start, short-term goals are still important for these 
        Bears. &quot;A win would be great,&quot; Caputi said. &quot;I think this 
        is a team we have a good chance to beat...we have to prepare for every 
        possible scenario.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>On a positive note, defeating Hamilton College tomorrow should prove 
        to be an easier task than were attempts to dethrone three of NESCAC's 
        premier teams in Middlebury, Amherst and Tufts. The Continentals from 
        Hamilton are winless as well. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In practice sessions this week, the Polar Bears attempted to correct 
        mistakes from the Tufts game. Limiting opponents' field position, completing 
        drives, and special teams are some of the game aspects that will decide 
        whether or not Bowdoin parents will see their sons win the team's first 
        game in more than two years. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Caputi is remaining positive by focusing on small improvements. &quot;We 
        have to find ways to get better every day, every practice,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin community hopes that these small improvements will be key 
        in ending the Polar Bears' losing streak. There's no better time for the 
        men, playing at home against a struggling team, and on a weekend where 
        there will be more moral support than ever.<br>
