      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bowdoin prepares for financial uncertainty</font><br>
        <font size="2">ALISON McCONNELL<br>
        SPORTS EDITOR</font></p>
      <p align="left">In a time when news of sliding indicators and downward trends 
        seem to fill financial headlines, Bowdoin's administration is working 
        to offset the nation's apparent economic decline and plan for an unpredictable 
        future.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Treasurer Kent John Chabotar has not given his financial 
        outlook a drastic revision since the September 11 terrorist attacks. Instead, 
        he indicated that the College is proceeding cautiously in a time of national 
        uncertainty. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There is no major change,&quot; Chabotar said. &quot;We're 
        still dealing with an endowment that is lower than our forecast had been. 
        Based on a very conservative forecast, we were expecting an endowment 
        of $500 million by September 10.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The nation's economy showed signs of a downturn for some 
        time preceding the attacks and subsequent military response. According 
        to Chabotar, lower endowment levels were already a concern. &quot;It was 
        about $30 million lower on June 30 of this year than it was on June 30 
        of 2000, after we had taken $17 million out for spending,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's endowment is invested in a variety of accounts, 
        some of which do not easily translate to numerical worth. &quot;We have 
        so many different types of investments, including some which have no direct 
        market value,&quot; Chabotar said. &quot;Oftentimes we have to wait up 
        to three months to get those values.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Because of this, an up-to-date endowment figure is not readily 
        available. &quot;I can't give you a flash report as of today,&quot; Chabotar 
        said. &quot;I'd say that $430 million is a rough estimate at this stage.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College's financial administration, operating in a time 
        when economists cannot predict the direction of markets, is refraining 
        from methodology changes. &quot;We are keeping the same spending rate, 
        we're keeping the same basic investment philosophy,&quot; Chabotar said. 
        &quot;We're not market-timers; we don't see the market go up or down and 
        wildly change our investment approach. Over the long term, that's usually 
        counterproductive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After a period of unprecedented national economic expansion, 
        Bowdoin has needed to assess a new set of circumstances. &quot;We went 
        through a huge growth; the budget doubled and the endowment tripled,&quot; 
        Chabotar said. &quot;Now were looking at a budget that will rise much 
        more slowly, and an essentially flat endowment.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Because we take a 12-month lagging average [to measure 
        endowment], we're looking at suppressed earnings for a while, even if 
        the endowment picked up right now, &quot; Chabotar said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The treasurer indicated that the College's financial picture 
        isn't entirely pessimistic. &quot;Even if we took the worst-case scenario-the 
        deficits going full for the next four years-they are the equivalent of 
        four percent of the [roughly $100 million] budget,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In perspective, during the College's last budget crisis 
        (in 1988-1989), the highest deficit was 9.7 percent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College is taking some steps to act with the times. 
        &quot;We're looking at taking $1.4 million out of the budget,&quot; Chabotar 
        said. &quot;We shared that with the Executive Committee [of the Trustees], 
        and they seemed to be saying that we're heading in the right direction.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The cuts are really budget relief,&quot; he continued. 
        &quot;About $400,000 is new restricted money for academic programs, and 
        the million dollars is in cuts from various areas, spread out over two 
        years.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar said that the cuts will stem from staff spending 
        budgets and travel. Administrative and support staff compensation and 
        will probably be offset by gift-raising efforts. &quot;We're assuming 
        we'll get the endorsement of the financial planning committee at the Trustees' 
        meeting in October,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This year's changes will be effective as soon as a go-ahead 
        is given, and the 2001-2002 budget cuts will be made later in the school 
        year. &quot;Essentially, we've said to the budget committee that we know 
        where we can find a million bucks,&quot; Chabotar said. &quot;The committee 
        members will look at it, and if they like the idea they will incorporate 
        that savings into the budget they present to Barry and I in January.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar was adamant that alterations in College spending 
        would not affect professor positions, student programs, or financial aid. 
        &quot;In terms of priorities, the first is academic programs; we're not 
        a bank or insurance company, we're a college,&quot; he said. &quot;The 
        academic programs come first. That means maintaining a number of faculty 
        with a competitive salary...and keeping class sizes reasonable.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;A very close second is financial aid, both to maintain 
        affordability and to increase diversity,&quot; he said. &quot;We expect 
        our financial aid costs to rise fairly rapidly going forward, particularly 
        if we try to become more diverse.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the treasurer, next year's budget will include 
        a nationwide college trend: a hike in tuition. &quot;It will definitely 
        go up,&quot; he said. &quot;The College's costs are going up between four 
        and five percent a year, and if the endowment isn't performing, which 
        it isn't, and two-thirds of our revenue comes from tuition, we either 
        cut services or we raise the price.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The pro-former budget, which the trustees look at as an 
        early estimate, assumed a 4.5 percent average rise in tuition and fees. 
        Last year's tuition rate saw a five percent increase.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar said that the College is aware of the difficulties 
        associated with tuition increases. &quot;Clearly, they have an effect 
        on students' parents,&quot; he said. He went on to assert that Bowdoin 
        is still very concerned with families' ability to pay.<br>
