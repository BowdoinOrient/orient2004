      <p>The Women's Rugby Team defeated Providence College's A- and B-side squads 
        last Saturday by scores of 45-15 and 25-3. Such a win shows great promise 
        for the ruggers' future, as Providence tied archrival Wellesley 5-5 just 
        a few weeks ago. <br>
      </p>

      <p>The Providence field was in poor condition last weekend, with patches 
        of grass missing and acorns and trash strew across the pitch, making tackles 
        and falls that much more painful. Additionally, in the middle of the A-side 
        game, a heavy rain engulfed the field and players continued despite slippery 
        conditions. <br>
        Bowdoin surprised Providence with a surge of offense in the game's first 
        ten minutes, and scored several tries almost immediately and without defense. 
        Providence was caught off guard, and came back stronger in rest of the 
        game with increased speed, force, and aggression. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coaches MaryBeth and Bob Matthews agreed that once Providence came back, 
        it was a pretty evenly matched game and exciting to watch. The official 
        of the game observed that it was some of the best women's rugby he'd seen 
        played at the collegiate level in years.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Emily Angel '04 scored several tries to boost the Bowdoin score, and 
        Julie Thompson '02 notched many of the team's points by making several 
        successful conversion kicks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Junior Camilla Yamada took advantage of the &quot;eight man pick up,&quot; 
        taking the ball from the end of the ruck (where the scrum half usually 
        gets it), faking a pass to the fly half, and making several impressive 
        runs to advance the field. <br>
        Keeping with the tradition of picking up where the A-side left off, the 
        Bowdoin B-side squad displayed considerable strength and passion on the 
        field. Only a portion of the team could attend the Providence game, due 
        to travel arrangements and fall break plans, but the members present each 
        gave their personal best on the field. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Junior Debbie Wissel stepped up into the challenging, transitional position 
        of scrum half, which she hadn't played in over a year. Sophomore backs 
        Courtney Reilly and Maria Stevens excelled in several exciting runs, and 
        first year Leann Sterio completed the &quot;good clown&quot; penalty to 
        perfection, gaining almost 20 yards for the team. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The difference between rookies and returning players is really 
        balancing out,&quot; Wissel said. &quot;We've solidified and are determined 
        to continue our undefeated streak.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Providence win was crucial, because it brought the women one step 
        closer to clenching a New England finals spot in November. In a few weeks, 
        the women will face rival Wellesley in a game that promises to be the 
        season's pivotal match. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The women play at home against the University of Rhode Island tomorrow. 
        Come out behind Farley at 11:00 a.m. with your folks and catch the Bears 
        do some damage.<br>
