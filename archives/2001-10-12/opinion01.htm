      <p align="left"><font size="5">Citizenship is not free, freedom at a cost</font><br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">If the attacks of September 11 make one thing eminently 
        clear, it is<br>
        the debt we owe to those who serve our great nation. These men and<br>
        women, many of whom risk their lives, work to protect and preserve our<br>
        liberty and way of life. Their work guarantees the privileges and<br>
        benefits we enjoy as American citizens. Yet we do not value their work.<br>
        Careers in the military or government are seen as second-rate choices.<br>
        The majority of us, come election time, do not even fulfill our<br>
        obligations as citizens. Jury duty and other forms of civic obligation<br>
        are looked down upon and shirked whenever possible. We clearly do not<br>
        value our place as citizens of the United States.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The answer to this problem lies in universal national service 
        as a<br>
        condition of citizenship. If every American had to devote two years of<br>
        their life to serving our country, we might then appreciate our place<br>
        as citizens a little more. I am not proposing universal military<br>
        service, though there is absolutely nothing wrong with honorable<br>
        service in the world's greatest armed forces. What I am proposing is<br>
        everyone spending two years of their life serving our nation in some<br>
        capacity or the other.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This could come in many forms. Not just the obvious international 
        forms<br>
        like the military or Peace Corps, but in more domestic capacities as<br>
        well. Our current Teach for America and Americorps are wonderful<br>
        examples, but we can go even farther. The Kennedy-era Vista program or,<br>
        to hark back even farther, the New Deal programs like the Civilian<br>
        Conservation Corps or the Federal Writers Project could serve as models<br>
        for national service programs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The real benefit would not only be in the work actually 
        done, but also<br>
        what it would do for those required to serve. They would gain the<br>
        understanding that what we have in America is not free. That the<br>
        privileges we enjoy come at a cost. Civic responsibility and national<br>
        pride would be increased. Currently, a career in the military or other<br>
        form of national service is seen as an impediment in the career world.<br>
        By implementing this system, we would reverse that trend, ensuring that<br>
        national service could never harm one's future prospects.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another model we could propose would be to remove the universal 
        element<br>
        and make citizenship contingent on national service. This would reserve<br>
        the privilege of citizenship for those who really want it and<br>
        understand the obligations it entails. While the benefits would be<br>
        limited to those who serve, this would create a solid, motivated base<br>
        of citizenship. On the other hand, it would lead to a division in our<br>
        society that is a little too undemocratic for the American character,<br>
        hence the desirability of the universal element.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Universal National Service is a concept that has been around 
        since the<br>
        Truman administration, yet its time is now. In our increasingly<br>
        fragmented and factional world, Americans need to know what our<br>
        country is about. Daily we move farther and farther away from President<br>
        Kennedy's famous injunction to &quot;ask not what your country can do 
        for<br>
        you but what you can do for your country.&quot; By giving two years of 
        our<br>
        lives to our nation, we would be helping to make our nation a greater<br>
        place, and our a citizens a greater people.</p>
