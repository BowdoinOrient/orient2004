      <p> The pop/rock group Everclear, which came to Bowdoin on Friday, September 
        28, received wide acclaim with their anthem &quot;Santa Monica&quot; in 
        1995, but were quickly labeled as one-hit wonders. Their next album, So 
        Much for the Afterglow, proved the label wrong with several hits such 
        as &quot;Father of Mine&quot; and &quot;I Will Buy You A New Life.&quot; 
        They are now touring to promote an ambitious project - companion albums 
        Songs From An American Movie, Volume One: Learning How to Smile and Songs 
        From An American Movie, Volume Two: Good Times For A Bad Attitude, both 
        released in 2000. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Realizing that the Bowdoin audience did not consist of diehard fans who 
        knew all the words to &quot;Strawberry,&quot; Everclear stuck to two basic 
        strategies - playing the hits and keeping their songs loud and fast. They 
        started with &quot;So Much For the Afterglow,&quot; &quot;Heroin Girl,&quot; 
        and &quot;Amphetamine&quot;--which are some of the punk-iest songs in 
        their catalog, then they played a few hits. Two singles from each of the 
        Songs From An American Movie albums were played, and the only other material 
        from those albums featured was &quot;Song From An American Movie Pt. 1&quot; 
        and &quot;Song From An American Movie Pt. 2&quot;; combined into a single 
        song. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The trio of Alexakis, bassist Craig Montoya, and drummer Greg Eklund 
        was augmented by three additional musicians, allowing Eklund to venture 
        beyond his drum set to play his ukulele. Mostly, the touring band helped 
        make the songs louder. But the sound in Morrell Gym wasn't great. Everclear 
        didn't benefit from the intimate environment, they rocked a lot harder 
        when I saw them play for 65,000 people. A moshpit did spring up, of course, 
        but it was unnecessarily violent during softer songs like &quot;Wonderful.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The band may have been a little rusty, and understandably. Before playing 
        acoustic fan favorite &quot;Strawberry&quot; mid-set, Alexakis addressed 
        the audience and said that this was the first show they were playing since 
        September 11 (several tour dates were canceled or delayed) and that he 
        didn't know what to say, so the band was just going to play their music. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Everclear got angry for their encore and started with the instrumental 
        metal stomp &quot;El Distorto de Melodica,&quot; followed by the classic 
        &quot;You Make Me Feel Like A Whore.&quot; Previously, Everclear would 
        end their shows by inviting up a bunch of kids from the audience to dance 
        on stage as the band played &quot;Local God,&quot; a cool song from the 
        soundtrack to William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Sadly, this song for 
        this ritual has been replaced, and is now &quot;Rock Star,&quot; the new 
        single, which has been sold to the movie Rock Star. This song is quite 
        possibly the worst Everclear song out there. It was probably still cool 
        for the kids who got to live their own rock star fantasies, though. But 
        this ended the show on a low note for me, until a friend's eye caught 
        one of Alexakis's guitar picks on the floor, and I took home a piece of 
        rock and roll memorabilia.</p>
