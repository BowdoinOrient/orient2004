      <p align="left">Over 100 perspective students from Maine visited Bowdoin 
        College with their families for Bowdoin's annual Maine Day on September 
        28. During the day visiting students had the opportunity to hear about 
        admissions, financial aid, and student and academic life as well as attend 
        classes and take campus tours.<br>
        Many students had positive responses, including Jayme Quinn, a prospective 
        student from Gorham, who felt the day gave &quot;a good balance of perspective.&quot; 
        Kate Johnston, also from Gorham, &quot;thought the tour was particularly 
        good. I've been on a lot of tours, but this one was better; we actually 
        got to see the dorms.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Admissions Office reported a ten percent increase in 
        students attending Maine Day this year. The program remained the same 
        as in years past, except that this year Admissions coordinated with the 
        Career Planning Center to hold &quot;Beyond Bowdoin: Your Liberal Arts 
        in Action&quot; on the same day as Maine Day. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Beyond Bowdoin&quot; was a series of informational 
        panels featuring Bowdoin alumni, which focused on several career options. 
        This year, the panelists chosen had all worked in Maine and many were 
        from Maine originally. <br>
        Lisa Tessler, the Directior of Alumni Career Programs, explained that 
        &quot;we thought it would offer inspiration to Maine students to feature 
        alumni from their state.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Several prospective students found the panels enlightening. 
        Lindsay Hammes, a senior from Augusta, was originally only looking at 
        Bowdoin because her mother wanted her to stay close to home. She was reluctant 
        to come to Bowdoin because she wanted to go to a school with a journalism 
        program. After attending a Beyond Bowdoin panel, &quot;Utilizing Communication 
        Skills in the Media Professions,&quot; Lindsay said, &quot;I realized 
        I could still do journalism if I went to Bowdoin. Now Bowdoin is one of 
        my first choices.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Maine Day is a part of an ongoing effort to attract students 
        from Maine to Bowdoin. Admissions holds two Maine Days every year, one 
        in the fall and one in the spring (primarily by high school juniors). 
        In addition, representatives from Bowdoin attend two college fairs for 
        Maine Students. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wendy Thompson, Assistant Dean of Admissions and Coordinator 
        of Special Events, said that the purpose of these efforts is to &quot;increase 
        exposure, particularly to the strongest students in Maine. We want them 
        to realize that one of the most competitive colleges in America is in 
        their backyard.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Maine students constitute 15.7 percent of the first year 
        class and 14.3 percent of the entire student body. Admissions would like 
        to maintain this percentage and possibly increase it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thompson explained the school's interest in students from 
        Maine: &quot;We are committed to diversity in all forms-geographically, 
        socio-economically, racially. This includes Maine students, particularly 
        from rural Maine. These students may be living very different lifestyles. 
        For instance, a student from a small Main logging town brings a unique 
        experience to the school.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thompson would like to thank the Bowdoin community for giving 
        the visiting students a warm welcome. </p>
