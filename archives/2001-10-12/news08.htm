      <p align="left"><i>Editor's Note: The report discussed here was commissioned 
        by the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) presidents 
        in December of last year and was intended as a followup to the book The 
        Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values. Because there was 
        not ample time between the release of this report and press time to cover 
        the report in depth, this article and <a href="news01.htm">this article</a> 
        simply summarize the results of the report . Further analysis, including 
        interviews, will appear in a follow-up article next week.</i></p>
      <p>According to a recent report, 75 percent of the males who were recruited 
        by NESCAC schools to play football, basketball, or ice hockey are in the 
        bottom one third of their class. In addition, these students scored an 
        average of 150 points lower on their SATs than did their average non-athletic 
        counterparts. These are only two statistics taken from a 30-page report 
        titled the &quot;Academic-Athletic Divide,&quot; which was presented to 
        the NESCAC presidents on September 27. The report was kept under wraps 
        until this week, when President Barry Mills released it to the College 
        on Tuesday.<br>

      <p>The report was written by the authors of <i>The Game of Life</i>, William 
        G. Bowen and James L. Shulman. The report follows a meeting on December 
        14, 2000 when NESCAC presidents discussed the findings from The Game of 
        Life and requested that a similar study be conducted that included all 
        NESCAC schools.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The in-school data used in the new study came from the NESCAC matriculating 
        classes of 1995, and the admissions data came from NESCAC matriculating 
        classes of 1999. <br>
      </p>
      <p>(Tufts, however, was not included in the report due to its comparatively 
        larger student-body size. Williams also was not included in studies that 
        used recruitment as a variable, because it was unable to supply recruiting 
        information. Bates was not included in studies that used SAT scores, because 
        submitting such scores is considered optional for Bates applicants.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>The report compared participation, recruitment, admission, and academic 
        performance of both male and female athletes and non-athletes. Male athletes 
        were further broken down into high-profile sports (football, basketball, 
        and ice hockey) and low-profile sports (all others). Bowen and Shulman 
        did not designate any women's sports as high-profile.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The report was also able to use recruitment as a factor in its analyses. 
        Students were considered &quot;recruited athletes,&quot; according to 
        the report, if their &quot;name had been placed on a coach's recommendation 
        list that was used by the admissions office when making admittance decisions.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first numbers the report looked at were percentages of athletic participation. 
        In the '95 class, an average of almost half of male students and a third 
        of female students played an intercollegiate sport at some point during 
        their college career.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The next area that the report looked at was recruitment. Recruitment 
        played the biggest role in high-profile athletics (68 percent of the high-profile 
        athletes were recruited), but it also played an important role in low-profile 
        athletics (40 percent of low-profile athletes and 50 percent of female 
        athletes had been recruited).<br>
      </p>
      <p>The report then looked at the admissions advantage that recruited players 
        receive over non-recruited players. The report found that the average 
        male recruit has a 34 percentage-point advantage over the average male 
        non-recruit, and the average female recruit has a 33 percentage-point 
        advantage over the average female non-recruit.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The report also found that athletes in general tend to have lower SAT 
        scores than non-athletes. Low-profile athletes and females tended to have 
        scores of 30 points less than students at large, and high-profile athletes 
        tended to have scores of more than 125 points below those of students 
        at large.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It was also found that recruited athletes had even lower scores than 
        non-recruited athletes. Recruited high-profile athletes had scores almost 
        90 points below the walk-ons in the same sports. Recruited low-profile 
        athletes and female athletes also had lower SAT scores than the walk-ons 
        in the same sports, although walk-on low-profile and female athletes tended 
        to have about the same scores as non-athletes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The report also indicated that not only do athletes come to college with 
        lower test scores, but they perform even worse in college than would be 
        expected of students with such test scores.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Although athletes do tend to graduate in higher numbers than non-athletes, 
        they do not at all perform as well in the classroom as non-athletes. Two-thirds 
        of high-profile athletes were in the bottom third of their class, and 
        more than one-quarter were in the bottom one-tenth of their class.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The difference was even more pronounced with recruited athletes. Three-quarters 
        of high-profile recruited athletes were in the bottom third of their class.<br>
        The report also showed that athletes were more likely to major in the 
        social sciences than the humanities, even though for students at large, 
        the percentage is about the same.<br>
      </p>
      <p>NESCAC schools include Amherst, Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Connecticut College, 
        Hamilton College, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, Wesleyan, and Williams.<br>
