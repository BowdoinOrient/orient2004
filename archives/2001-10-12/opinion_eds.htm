      <p align="left"><font size="4">Realigning Bowdoin's priorities</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The NESCAC presidents deserve praise for making the brave 
        move of confronting the athletics vs. academics problem that they must 
        have known about for many years. The decision to commission a public report 
        is a good first step in turning NESCAC schools around and realigning Bowdoin's 
        priorities.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The steps that follow will be the difficult ones, but they 
        must be taken. It is not easy for schools to make decisions about cutting 
        down on the size and the budgets of athletic programs, but certainly something 
        must change. <br>
        This change cannot come in the form of &quot;treating the wound,&quot; 
        either. Extra academic assistance for those athletes who fall behind is 
        not the answer. The answer is to admit an athletic group that reflects 
        the diversity of the student body, specifically in relation to academics.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is also true that the NESCAC schools must act together. 
        This cannot be turned into an arms race. Schools must be comfortable with 
        being able to cut back, without feeling as if they will lose their competitive 
        edge. <br>
        But this does not excuse Bowdoin from its own responsibilities. Bowdoin 
        needs to decide for itself where its own statistics fit in, and how best 
        it can rectify the situation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While the NESCAC report delivers very specific results, 
        these results raise the larger need to question the role of athletics 
        at Bowdoin. Many NESCAC schools have more varsity athletes than some Division 
        I schools, and Bowdoin boasts that 80 percent of its students play some 
        form of sports.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But anytime numbers are this large, one must be wary of 
        the situation. If so many Bowdoin students are involved in sports, then 
        they should be supports. But disproportionate funding and support for 
        athletics has without question ended up neglecting the arts and student-run 
        organizations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Such a disproportionate number has an even further effect 
        on the climate of a college campus, and this effect cannot be measured 
        by a report. If the College's desire in terminating fraternities was to 
        create a more diverse and open community, then sports teams tend to act 
        against that goal, not with it.<br>
        Athletics are at least as divisive to &quot;community&quot; as fraternities-they 
        are the largest cliques on campus-but, unlike fraternities, they cannot 
        host parties or dinners open to the entire campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is no denying that athletics play a vital role on 
        college campuses, both for the individual athlete and for the spectators 
        the teams bring together. They certainly need, and deserve, the institutional 
        support of the College. But it's time to reflect on exactly what that 
        need is.</p>

        motivations</font></font></p>
      <p>Today's Sarah and James Bowdoin Day ceremony celebrates both academic 
        achievement and the life of the mind. There seems to be something oddly 
        contradictory about these goals. Quite simply, grades do not measure the 
        life of the mind. It might be more correct to say that the day celebrates 
        the life of the mind, in spite of academic achievement. </p>
      <p>The planners of the SJB ceremony, realizing this, reminded students that 
        the tenor of the day should transcend local issues. They urged the student 
        speaker to remember this, too, and apply it to his or her speech. In other 
        words, the speaker should talk about things more important, more global 
        than the triviality of grades and awards.</p>
      <p>There is further irony in the strange fact that the College pays a student 
        $250 to give this speech. The speaker has not always been paid; the College 
        started giving out the stipend just a few years ago to encourage (to bribe?) 
        the scholars, who had otherwise shown little interest in speaking. In 
        light of this fact, we must wonder: why do students offer to give this 
        speech? Is it for the greater good of the life of the mind? For the cash? 
        For the same reasons we get good grades?</p>
