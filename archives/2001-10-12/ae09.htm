      <p>&quot;The vorpal blade went snicker - snack,&quot; cutting cleanly through 
        the yielding Styrofoam receptacle. The mind buzzed with creativity, finding 
        solace from the monotonous drones of the company meeting in the eternity 
        of possibilities contained within the parameters of that small cup. What 
        had once held a single serving of hot coffee now contained the outlet 
        for the artistically burdened thoughts of one Jules Vitali. <br>

      <p>'Styrofoam cups?' The doubt that one might initially express upon hearing 
        of such an unconventional medium quickly dissipates, however, after taking 
        a few turns around the exhibition of Vitali's work, housed in the Lamarche 
        lounge of Smith Union through October. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each piece was made from a cup, but the similarities end there. From 
        the Primitive pieces - plain Styrofoam, to the acrylic pieces, to the 
        lacquer and enamel pieces, to the br&oacute;nze pieces--all reflected 
        a previously untapped creativity. Just as the dimensions of a square of 
        paper become lost in the folds of origami, the shape of the vessel disappeared 
        into the explosion of carefully rendered and assembled shards that has 
        been christened Styrogami.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The common eight-ounce Styrofoam cup has been Vitali's vehicle for aesthetic 
        exploration since 1982 when he first took out his small, razor sharp jackknife 
        and got &quot;a little bit creative.&quot; Since then, Vitali's Craftsman 
        jackknife, an edition no longer made, has helped him imprint his vision 
        on over a thousand cups.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The display in Lamarche lounge is the sampling of a genre created on 
        the go. At meetings, in line, and even waiting for his daughter to be 
        born in the hospital - when given the canvas of the cup and a few idle 
        moments to spare, Vitali snaps open his knife and carves. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Reactions to Vitali's work is sharply divided: Vitali said that &quot;people 
        either see them as Styrofoam cups or they see them as art - there is no 
        middle ground.&quot; The positive reactions, however, are &quot;very positive.&quot; 
        Ignoring the reactions of critics, Vitali sees two very different sides 
        in his own work. &quot;There is a fun, light side&#133;but there is alsoa 
        dark side&quot; said Vitali. The pieces can be &quot;cutesy and kind of 
        fun&quot; and pleasing to children, noting his sculptures of mermaids 
        and ships. On the other hand, there are also deep moral and ecological 
        implications connected to his use of Styrofoam as a medium.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Vitali has &quot;never bought a Styrofoam cup in [his] life&quot; and 
        &quot;can't stand Styrofoam and the 'throwaway' philosophy that it represents.&quot; 
        But, he noted that his &quot;meager efforts&#133;have taken at least a 
        thousand of them [Styrofoam cups] out of landfills and turned them into&#133;things 
        of beauty.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Trash? Yes. Art? Definitely. For Vitali, the canvas may be in the form 
        of seemingly mundane Styrofoam cups, but none can dispute the fact that 
        Styrogami is already leaving a mark on the world. His work will be on 
        display in Lamarche Lounge, open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., throughout 
        October.</p>
