        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;I'm a first year student living in 
        a &quot;chem-free&quot; dormitory. I was over at a friend's room, in one 
        of the upper-class houses. Her roommate smokes, and their room smelled 
        pretty awful. My friend says she doesn't mind, but I'm allergic to smoke, 
        and had to leave. I wonder what my options will be next year?&quot; R.B.</p>
      <p>Dear R.B.: With your allergy to tobacco smoke, I'm glad to hear you're 
        living in a &quot;chemical-free&quot; dormitory. As a matter of fact, 
        I wish all Bowdoin students could be living in safer, smoke-free, housing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The dangers of smoking are exceedingly well known. A full 30 percent 
        of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco use. 33 percent of all smokers 
        will die prematurely because of their habit. With typical smoking rates 
        on college campuses being about 28 percent, this means that nearly one 
        in ten college students in this country will die prematurely from tobacco 
        use.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Members of Bowdoin's Class of 2004 reported a lifetime tobacco use rate 
        of 38 percent, a figure that represents a 13 percent increase over their 
        predecessors in the Class of 2003. During the previous year, more than 
        20 percent reported smoking more than once a month, while 18 percent reported 
        smoking six times or less. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The dangers of second-hand smoke are also now equally clear. Environmental 
        tobacco smoke, like asbestos, is a Class A carcinogen. That means that 
        exposure to second hand smoke is dangerous in any amount. In other words, 
        there is no such thing as a safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke, 
        no matter how small, no matter how infrequent. Dividing indoor space into 
        smoking and non-smoking sections is not protective. As someone recently 
        put it so well, having a non-smoking section in a restaurant (you can 
        substitute dormitory here), is like having a non-peeing section in a swimming 
        pool!<br>
        Bowdoin is not alone in permitting smoking in students' rooms. In fact, 
        of 22 peer institutions, only two (Oberlin and Wellesley) have banned 
        smoking in residences. Nationally, 81 percent of colleges ban smoking 
        in all public places, but only 27 percent prohibit smoking in students' 
        dormitory rooms.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After all the legal thrashing tobacco companies have taken in recent 
        years, they are no longer able to target children and young adolescents 
        in their marketing campaigns. Industry watchdogs have reported that tobacco 
        companies are unequivocally now targeting older adolescents, especially 
        college students. Students may think they are being treated especially 
        well at those pub nights, sponsored by R J R, or that they just like to 
        go hear the bands that are brought in, but they are in fact being bought 
        and sold by proven marketing ploys. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While it is true that relatively few students at Bowdoin smoke - or at 
        least say they smoke - a greater number experiment with occasional &quot;social&quot; 
        smoking at parties, or while drinking with friends. Unfortunately, a substantial 
        number will go on to smoke more, and to smoke more often. Over time, they 
        may well become regular smokers. Nicotine has greater than a 50 percent 
        addiction rate.<br>
        Recent studies from the Harvard School of Public Health have shown that 
        living in smoke-free dormitories significantly lowers your risk of becoming 
        an addicted smoker. Nonsmoking students entering college are 40 percent 
        less likely to take up smoking if they live in smoke-free dorms. Students 
        who smoke but want to quit have an easier time of it if they live in smoke-free 
        dorms and are more likely to quit for good.</p>
      <p>What can be done? If you and your friends are concerned, you need to 
        express those concerns. You need to talk with other students, and talk 
        to student government leaders. If you want smoke-free housing, you need 
        to advocate for it for all Bowdoin students. It is your right to study 
        here in a safe and healthy environment. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Be well!<br>
      </p>
