        EDITOR IN CHIEF</font></p>
      <p align="left">Military, state, and federal agencies within Maine have 
        remained on high alert this week, after U.S. air raids started overseas 
        Sunday. </p>
      <p><b>Portland Jetport</b><br>
        The Portland International Jetport reopened sections of its parking garage 
        yesterday, one month after the FAA mandated that no cars could park within 
        300 feet of any U.S. airport terminal.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While the 300-feet rule is still in effect, the Portland Jetport received 
        special permission from the FAA to use certain parts of the garage that 
        are within 300 feet of the terminal.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Kevin Sullivan, marketing director for the jetport, &quot;the 
        concrete wall in the center of the garage in effect acts as what would 
        be a blast shield, so to speak.&quot; For this reason, he said, the FAA 
        granted a partial waiver for the garage.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The entire first floor of the garage is being used for rental cars, the 
        back half of the second floor is being used for paid parking, and the 
        entire top floor is being used for paid parking. For now, the garage will 
        be used primarily for daily parking.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All cars entering the garage are being searched.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Weekly and overflow parking will continue in the satellite lot on Congress 
        St., which is serviced by a free shuttle bus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The construction of a new garage, which was underway prior to the events 
        of September 11, has not been affected, as it is beyond 300 feet of the 
        terminal.</p>
      <p><b>Naval Air Station Brunswick</b><br>
        According to John W. James, director of public affairs for the Brunswick 
        Naval Air Station, the base is operating in support of Operation Noble 
        Eagle, the homeland defense operation for the U.S., said John W. James, 
        director of public affairs for the station.<br>
      </p>
      <p>James was not able to comment on the Brunswick squadrons' activities 
        in regard to Operation Enduring Freedom, which is the offensive anti-terrorist 
        mission overseas.<br>
      </p>

            perimeter of Brunswick Naval Air Station as part of increased security

            Orient</i>)</font></td>

      </table>
      <p>Starting September 11, the station's security level was Threat Condition 
        Delta, which is the highest level. Under orders from the Department of 
        Defense, stations nationwide are now forbidden to release information 
        about specific security levels or operations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Suffice it to say, it is a very heightened state of alert. We're 
        extremely vigilant. We feel safe, and we think the community, including 
        our neighbors at Bowdoin College, should feel safe,&quot; James said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are four active squadrons and two reserve squadrons stationed at 
        the base. While neither of the two reserve squadrons has been mobilized 
        yet, a reserve ground support unit of about 100 people was activated last 
        week and is being mobilized somewhere to the European theater.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're waiting for other reserve units to be called up&#133;but 
        we don't know when it's going to happen,&quot; James said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Naval Air Station Brunswick is the last active-duty military airfield 
        remaining in the northeast. While there are a number of reserve bases 
        in the Northeast, the nearest active-duty base is the McGuire Air Force 
        Base in New Jersey. NAS Brunswick is the U.S. military base closest to 
        the European theater and NATO commands. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Approximately 20 percent of NAS Brunswick's activities are in direct 
        support of the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Bath, the Navy operation that 
        oversees the building of the AEGIS destroyers at the Bath Iron Works. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Supervisor of Shipbuilding operation has also increased its security 
        measures, but a spokeswoman could not release any information. The Bath 
        Iron Works has closed two of its four entry gates since September 11 and 
        has increased its security posture as well. </p>
      <p><b>Ports of Entry</b><br>
        All ports of entry in Maine are open, according to Paul Morris, deputy 
        district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Portland. 
        This includes 32 land border ports of entry, the airports in Portland 
        and Bangor, and the sea ports along the coast.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We are at a heightened state of alert, and in some cases that may 
        slow the crossing process somewhat. In all cases, we are doing what we 
        can to both enforce the laws and facilitate entry.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin students who headed to Canada over Fall Break last weekend had 
        different experiences at the border. Some said they had to deal with car 
        searches and waited over an hour to pass through; others said they passed 
        through in minutes. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While none of the ports have been closed permanently, the land border 
        port of entry at Highgate, Vermont, which is governed by the Portland 
        district of the INS, was shut down for almost seven hours Wednesday after 
        a bomb threat was called in. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Houlton Sector of the Border Patrol, which monitors border activity 
        between the ports of entry, also reported increased surveillance and security.</p>
      <p><b>Waterways</b><br>
        All Maine waterways are open, according to petty officer Clifton Yopp 
        of the U.S. Coast Guard, Group Portland. The Coast Guard has increased 
        its harbor patrol efforts, especially at the international marine terminal 
        in Portland, which passenger ferries and cruise ships, among other vessels, 
        pass through.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Coast Guard is regularly searching vessels and their contents, Yopp 
        said.<br>
        The U.S. Coast Guard continues to operate a security zone in the Kennebec 
        River around the Bath Iron Works, which makes it criminal for any boat 
        to enter within 400 feet of the shoreline of the boatyard. This policy 
        was put into effect following the USS Cole bombing in Yemen last year.</p>
