        Mexico</font><br>
        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font><br>
        Disgusted at the politics of Washington D.C., William Pitt Fessenden returned 
        home to Portland in 1843 to spend his days battling other lawyers in court 
        and raising his family. The Whig Party, of which Fessenden was a member, 
        was in trouble, for disunion and disorganization plagued its ranks. Its 
        own inner bickering was part of why Fessenden returned to Portland, seemingly 
        retiring from the politics of the nation's capital. The next few years 
        would see him close to home, promoting railroads, teaching his sons about 
        the ways of the academic world, becoming a member of the governing board 
        at Bowdoin College, and returning to the State Legislature in 1845. In 
        the State Legislature, Fessenden would lend his support to Neal Dow's 
        Temperance crusade and oppose the war with Mexico, which was stirring 
        up controversy all over the North.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ties between Mexico and the United States were severed when 
        the Polk administration finally annexed Texas. The U.S. claimed that its 
        new borders extended to the Rio Grande River, which intensified the political 
        war. When President Polk's envoy to Mexico was refused an audience, the 
        president sent General Zachary Taylor's army into the area south of the 
        Nueces River. Armed conflict began here in April 1846, and President Polk 
        went to Congress with a war message.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And thus, the nation went to war with its neighbor. The 
        problem here, as was the case in the War of 1812, was that Northerners 
        were not too keen on riding into Mexico City with guns blazing. New Englanders 
        believed the war to be immoral and abolitionists saw this as an opportunity 
        for the slave states to extend their control into the newly acquired lands.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, another Bowdoin graduate by 
        the name of Franklin Pierce (Class of 1824) was getting excited to fight 
        Mexican ruler Antonio L&oacute;pez de Santa Anna. Pierce had been offered 
        the post of attorney general in the Polk administration. He refused to 
        accept the position as there was a war on and he intended to be at the 
        very front of it. Thus, having resolved to gain military glory, Pierce 
        volunteered as a private in the United States army. His political connections 
        and background, however, soon elevated him to the rank of brigadier general.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Down in Mexico, Zachary Taylor had won a number of victories 
        in the northern part of the country. But despite these defeats, the Mexicans 
        were far from giving into U.S. demands. What was needed was the capture 
        of Mexico City and to this task President Polk turned towards another 
        general, Winfield Scott. It was the belief of the administration that 
        an amphibious landing on the coast of Mexico and a march inland towards 
        the capital would be the best course of action. Coincidently, the Spanish 
        conquistador Cort&eacute;s had used this same rout to conquer Mexico in 
        the early 1500s.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On March 9, 1847, Winfield Scott, arguably one of the most 
        amazing soldiers in American history, landed his ten-thousand-man army 
        at the Mexican coastal town of Vera Cruz. Fearful that a direct assault 
        on that fortified Mexican bastion would lead to unnecessary casualties, 
        Scott sat down for a siege. It was less than a month after Scott's landing 
        and siege preparations before the Mexican garrison surrendered.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Franklin Pierce was in New England gathering supplies and 
        equipment when news of Vera Cruz's fall reached the press. Fearing that 
        the war would be over before he got over there, Pierce quickened his pace 
        and, by May 27 , had set sail for Mexico to join Scott's army.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Scott, in the meantime, was in desperate need for reinforcements. 
        After Vera Cruz had fallen, the general had set his army forward towards 
        Mexico City. He came face to face with Santa Anna's men at a place called 
        Cerro Gordo. With the help of his engineers, mostly West Point graduates 
        who would in a matter of years be leading armies against each other in 
        the Civil War, Scott was able to outflank and outfight the Mexican army 
        facing him. With this major victory under his belt Scott's command advanced 
        as far inland as the town of Puebla, a mere 75 miles from Mexico City, 
        before halting. His volunteers' enlistments had run out, thus, as a large 
        chunk of his command left him to return to the United States, Scott eagerly 
        awaited to arrival of new troops.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">By the end of June 1847, Pierce's command arrived at Vera 
        Cruz. Before he began his march to reach Scott's army deep within enemy 
        territory, however, he learned that many of his transport animals had 
        stampeded, thus delaying his departure from the coast for two weeks. On 
        July 14, Pierce set out with his command towards the gates of Mexico City. 
        Progress was slow on the march as sandy roads impeded the progress of 
        the 2,500 man brigade, its artillery train, and supply wagons. Pierce 
        fought off a number of Mexican attacks and was even successful in forcing 
        his way across a defended bridge.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the march continued, the environment changed. The higher 
        up the troops went the more plants they saw. Flowers, cacti, trees, streams, 
        paved roads, and small towns flanked the path of the invading army. Through 
        all this, there was time for reflection, and Pierce wrote in his diary:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I hate war in all its aspects, I deem it unworthy 
        of the age in which I live &amp; of the Govt. in which I have borne some 
        part&#133;there can be no such thing as a profound sense of justice, the 
        sacredness of individual rights and the value of human life connected 
        with human butchery, and all men, who think and feel as I think and feel, 
        and yet are found on fields of slaughter are in a false position from 
        education and the force of circumstances.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anyone who has studied the life of Franklin Pierce must 
        surely look twice at this passage that he wrote during the Mexican War. 
        Was this a clear moment of insight or was it some random rambling that 
        the life-long drunkard spewed into his notes? For while Pierce may have 
        believed this war &quot;unworthy of the age in which&quot; he lived, he 
        had still volunteered and persuaded hundreds of other New Englanders to 
        do so. Also, for a man so concerned about &quot;the sacredness of individual 
        rights and the value of human life&quot; it is strange that he would, 
        in the years of his presidency, not lift a single finger to free four 
        million people in bondage, nor would he support any act that would liberate 
        them from slavery and oppression.<br>
