      <p align="left">Dispensing with chronological order, I'd like to devote 
        this installment to my recent stay in Brunswick, my first visit to the 
        campus in more than forty years, and at a time of national crisis for 
        the US.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The two-week tour of New England with my Czech-born partner, 
        Zdenka, started on September 4. We arrived from London Heathrow at Logan 
        Airport, exactly a week before the tragedy of September 11; &quot;A New 
        Day of Infamy&quot; as the Boston Globe put it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Offered flight vouchers by United Airlines to the sum of 
        800 dollars each if we gave up our seats on the direct flight we had booked, 
        we flew to Boston via Washington, D.C. Even without terrorist activity, 
        this turned out to be an adventurous detour. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Arriving at Dulles Airport in late afternoon, we were told 
        that, due to heavy thunderstorms in the Boston area, our connecting flight 
        had been cancelled. <br>
        Eventually arriving at Logan at half-past nine, we still had a three hour 
        drive ahead of us by rented car to Williamstown in the Berkshires, our 
        first stop. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But from then on luck, at least as far as the weather was 
        concerned, seemed to be with us. New England, even before the leaves had 
        turned, couldn't have looked lovelier. The hot and sunny weather held 
        up until our very last day on the Cape, with 'all of America' behind us 
        (as Henry David Thoreau once said), as well as a stay which turned out 
        to be memorable in more ways than one. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Williamstown, home of a college just a year older than 
        Bowdoin, we saw an exhibition of Impressionist paintings mounted by the 
        Clark Institute, an internationally renowned art museum in a place where 
        one would least expect it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our next stop was a ski lodge on the edge of the White Mountain 
        National Park in New Hampshire. Amazingly enough, we had it all to ourselves. 
        Among tattered paperbacks on a shelf in the living room with huge fireplace, 
        I found Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving, an international best-seller 
        which was first published in 1956, the year I returned for my second year 
        at Bowdoin. It was a title I remember from my off-campus roommate Ed Podvoll, 
        who was into that sort of thing, always talking about it a great deal. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Exploring the National Park, we stopped off at Bretton Woods, 
        a prominent name in post-war financial history. Sitting on the porch of 
        the luxurious and wonderfully old-fashioned Hotel Mt. Washington, which 
        was built at the beginning of the century, I was reminded of similar ones, 
        in which, as an undergraduate, I had stayed with my sponsor, Mrs. Applegate, 
        of Christmas Cove, Maine. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Naturally, I had promised Zdenka a peek at Nellie's former 
        summer place, a bungalow almost at the tip of the point with stunning 
        view, sold by her in 1969, the year I left the States for England. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On Tuesday, September 11, after a weekend spent on Mt. Desert 
        Island, we headed down Route One towards Brunswick. While at Bowdoin I'd 
        never been north of Rockland, I laughingly told Zdenka. And I was in Rockland 
        only once to buy a fur-lined anorak at the local Army &amp; Navy Store. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Turning off at Damariscotta, we headed for South Bristol, 
        and Christmas Cove, so named by Captain John Smith after discovering the 
        pretty little place on Christmas Day 1624. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It seemed quite long ago since Big Brother Bill Beckett 
        had first taken me down to the Cove to meet his adopted mother. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Confused by a new road layout, I finally stopped to ask 
        someone for directions. </p>
      <p align="left">Almost immediately, they asked if I had heard the news. 
        Like everyone else I couldn't believe it. That is until actually seeing 
        the images one will not easily forget, on TV in Nellie's old place, having 
        been kindly asked in by the new owners, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Tremaine. They 
        turned out to be the very people who, all those years ago, had bought 
        the place from Nellie, furniture and all. I actually recognized some of 
        the antique pieces. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our final destination on that gloriously sunny, yet terrible, 
        day was 20 McKeen Street, home of Bob and Nesta Morrison, our kind hosts 
        for three memorable days in Brunswick. Ten minutes later, thinking we'd 
        only just arrived in the States, and concerned for our welfare, Belinda 
        Lovett of the Orient turned up, asking if I would like to meet some of 
        the Orient staff?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Belinda and Nick took me to lunch and invited me to join 
        them that evening at their weekly lay-out session on Cleaveland Street. 
        It made me feel just like an undergraduate member of the 'O-Team' again. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Did I find the campus much changed? Not really. Except for 
        new buildings which were discreetly beneath the same old pines. And the 
        flag, which flew at half-mast. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Familiar old fixtures like Massachusetts and Hubbard Halls 
        seemed to have preserved and their somewhat staid look. In the old library, 
        I was glad to see a portrait of 'Herby' Brown, my revered English teacher, 
        occupying a place of honor among other portraits of famous alumni and 
        former college presidents. The biggest and most delightful change, however, 
        was seeing girls on campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The door to the Chapel being ajar I had a quick look inside. 
        It too seemed apparently unchanged. Even the lectern up front, I thought, 
        might have been the very same one behind which I'd stood one day in the 
        spring of '55, to give a talk on Franco-German Reconciliation, reprinted 
        in full in the Orient. <br>
        I know it's a truism, but it seemed like only yesterday.</p>
