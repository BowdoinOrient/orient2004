      <p align="left">Looking for the interesting, unique, and weird? Want somewhere 
        to go in this little Brunswick town, someplace new in walking distance, 
        yet still worth a visit? Can't seem to find that one thing to spruce up 
        your room, or searching for a lost and out-of-print book, CD, video game, 
        comic book, or movie? Do you like swords? If you said &quot;yes&quot; 
        to any of the above, you might just want to take this Saturday or Sunday 
        off and visit the Brunswick Waterfront Flea Market. <br>
        The flea market is located in Fort Andross, the large brick building that 
        sits next to the Androscoggin river bridge, on the other side of US Route 
        1 from town. Though a bike would help, it is not too far of a walk.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The flea market is not unlike a giant, weekly garage sale. 
        Tables are set up in a huge, open room, with each proprietor bringing 
        a wide array of the second-hand, the antique, the rare and the interesting. 
        Each seller sets his own prices, and buyers are welcome to browse and 
        haggle at their will.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The flea market is a great place for treasure-seekers and 
        those searching for something unique or cool. What's on sale here has 
        accumulated in the collected attics, basements, and bookshelves of the 
        Brunswick area, and it will put any strip mall to shame in a variety of 
        items. There are entire shelves filled with dime-store westerns and schlocky 
        airport novels, alongside rare first editions and crumbling books of scholarly 
        criticism. There are piles of bargain basement and prematurely out-of-print 
        videos, and CDs from both one-hit wonders and quality groups that fell 
        through the cracks. Of course, there is the random house detritus collected 
        from generations of creepy old women, classic comic books and tabloids 
        from the 1960's, an entire table filled with unused LPs, collectable action 
        figures, statuettes, trading cards, jewelry&#133; almost anything imaginable. 
        There is even display of real, live swords, for those who still need the 
        most important bit of their Conan the Barbarian Halloween costume. Just 
        don't expect the college to be too happy about you carrying it around 
        with you to your classes!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">You're probably asking yourself right about now: &quot;What 
        good is all that crap?&quot; If you are, you need only to open your eyes 
        and think of all the little marvels that can be found amidst the junk. 
        Flea markets are some of the best places to find interesting and rare 
        stuff, at obscenely low prices. Why go through Ebay or some overpriced 
        &quot;novelty&quot; shop when you can find the same things within walking 
        distance?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And, best of all, there is none of the impersonality of 
        retail stores. Dan St.-Pierre, a retired seller whose stand includes watches, 
        old paperbacks, Nintendo games and videos, puts it the following way: 
        &quot;You see all kind of people here&#133; young and old, rich and poor. 
        You get to meet all kinds of new people, and, as the buyer, you can actually 
        haggle when you buy. It's the personal interaction that makes it great.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Possibly the best metaphor for the market comes from the 
        place itself. An unattended table is stacked high with VHS tapes in unmarked 
        sleeves. A sign reads &quot;Videos- $1 each. I do not know what is on 
        them.&quot; What wonders one may find!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Waterfront Flea Market is located at 14 Maine Street, 
        open Saturdays and Sundays year-round, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. To contact, 
        call 207-729-0378.</p>
