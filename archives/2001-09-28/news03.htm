      <p align="left">Saturday is moving day for the leaders of Ladd House. Residents, 
        with the assistance of College-paid movers, will transport their belongings 
        from their temporary home in Macmillan into their permanent residence 
        at 15 College Street. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This marks the end to an interesting fall journey for these 
        residents, a journey that began with the news on August 20, 12 days before 
        residents were to arrive on campus for House Leader Orientation, that 
        construction on Ladd would not be complete for more than a month. The 
        College had foreseen these problems, however.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin was not able to acquire Macmillan and Ladd until 
        about a year ago, according to Bill Gardiner, head of Facilities Management. 
        Ladd was immediately livable, but both houses required extensive repairs 
        and upgrades. The heating and electrical systems in place from the construction 
        of each structure 50 years ago had not been replaced and were operating 
        with outdated and patch-worked equipment. Sprinkler systems and telephone/data 
        lines had to be installed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To allow these improvements, as well as to repair walls 
        with damaged plaster, the interior walls had to be stripped to the wood 
        studs underneath. The windows in Macmillan had to be replaced. Many two-room 
        doubles in Ladd were converted into two one-room singles, furthering the 
        needed construction.<br>
        The purchase of the building and the plans to spend greater than $100,000 
        necessitated that both houses be modified to meet Americans with Disabilities 
        Act requirements and relevant fire codes. A second enclosed stairway had 
        to be added to each building, as did an elevator. Further, several doorways 
        were widened for wheelchair accessibility. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After the competitive bidding process was completed, a step 
        necessary to control costs, the contractor was selected and able to begin 
        work in April. With a limited supply of carpenters and tile layers in 
        the area, the College knew that completion by late August would be difficult. 
        Delays furthered the problem. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When workers began to install the elevator into Macmillan, 
        they noticed that the piston pushing the elevator itself was too short. 
        A clerical error at the manufacturer had sent Macmillan's piston to Wisconsin. 
        The roof above the elevator shaft had to be taken off to remove the carriage 
        and replace the part. <br>
        The College, however, had anticipated delays and late completion. Work 
        on Howell House, needed to meet ADA and fire code requirements, originally 
        scheduled to begin over the summer and to be completed by the end of Winter 
        Break, was delayed so that the space might be used for student housing 
        during at least a portion of the fall semester. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When it became apparent during the daily meetings with construction 
        managers on each project that the buildings would not be completed by 
        the August 22 deadline, the decision to delay construction at Howell until 
        next semester was made. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After discussion with students, the College made the decision 
        to house Howell residents in Howell house for fall semester and Macmillan 
        for the second. Ladd residents were to occupy temporary assignments in 
        Stowe Inn, Coles Tower, and the crash-rooms of first-year dorms until 
        Macmillan was ready for occupancy. Facilities then directed workers from 
        Ladd to Macmillan to make that house livable sooner. Macmillan was ready 
        for residence on August 27, though the basements, some common space, and 
        the second stairway were not yet complete.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Construction of Ladd will be completed tomorrow, though 
        troubleshooting and minor repairs will have to still be made. The installation 
        of a full-scale kitchen, to be used by Dining Services to feed Outward 
        Bound students during the summer and sports teams during break, will also 
        not be completed.</p>
