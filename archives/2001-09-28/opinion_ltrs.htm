      <p align="left">To the Community: </p>
      <p>We are the residents of 40 Harpswell Street, located adjacent to the 
        former Kappa Sigma House. Because 40 Harpswell Street is our home, and 
        because we enjoy living there, we feel the need to bring an issue to the 
        attention of the Bowdoin community. <br>
        Recently we have had complaints from residents in the neighborhood. Some 
        have been directed against us, and we have accepted responsibility for 
        those complaints. However, other complaints have been directed at students 
        who travel past our house down Harpswell Street on their way to other 
        off campus residences. Unfortunately, there is little we can do about 
        these complaints except to ask for your cooperation now. <br>
        Please recognize that when you are walking past our house late in the 
        evenings, that there are Brunswick residents who live all along Harpswell 
        Street. The neighborhoods around Bowdoin are thickly settled, with many 
        senior citizens, and it is up to all of us to be courteous to Brunswick 
        residents who keep very different hours than Bowdoin students do. <br>
        We are all members of the Bowdoin and the Brunswick community, and we 
        must respect our neighbors. So please, help keep Brunswick a great place 
        to live for everyone. </p>

      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>The newly inaugurated program for a sustainable Bowdoin, under the management 
        of facilities, has swung into action with the help of many students. Facilities 
        employee Keisha Payson has formed a student action committee that is working 
        to pursue ecological sustainability issues on campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The group has decided to tackle several key issues: reusing and reducing 
        waste, recycling the waste we do generate, and working towards a reduction 
        of fossil fuel use on campus in an effort to lessen our contribution to 
        global warming. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Look out for commercials, interviews, and documentaries on the Bowdoin 
        Cable Network, as well as posters, tables in the union, and WBOR public 
        service announcements. The goal of the student group and the Sustainable 
        Bowdoin Committee is to foster sustainable behavior in the faculty, staff, 
        and students on campus, as well as promoting the importance of sustainability 
        to the college administration. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The student activity is up and running, but it is not too late to get 
        involved. If you are interested in promoting the concept and practice 
        of sustainability on campus, give Keisha Payson a call, and let her know 
        you are interested. It's never to late to change a thing or two.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin's future is on the line. For an institution to survive, it requires 
        not only financial, but environmental sustenance. And our connection to 
        The Bowdoin Pines is more intimate than many of us recognize. Bowdoin 
        Students are moving to change the face of the college and many within 
        the administration and staff are behind the effort. From treasurer Kent 
        Chabotar, who chaired the Committee for a Sustainable Bowdoin last year, 
        to Vivian Asbra in Housekeeping, who helped initiate recycling in Chamberlain 
        Hall last year and is now working hard to encourage it in the tower. Nearly 
        30 students have also joined the ranks of those committed to strengthening 
        the college's relationship with the natural environment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The movement needs your support. First, convince your roommates, teammates, 
        and classmates to take up the causes of waste and energy reduction. If 
        you want to do more, go talk to Keisha in Room 12 of the tower. We need 
        your help.</p>
