      </p>
      <p align="left">In some sense, it seems proper to move on now. The flag 
        is no longer at half-staff; our country and the world's reactions have 
        been decided, but what do we do after this war on terrorism? How are we 
        going to restructure international relations? We have said much about 
        ridding the world of all the evil terrorists, but then, how will we prevent 
        them from coming back?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was suggested last week at the panel discussing the events 
        of September 11, that perhaps it is time to reassess the role and idea 
        of the nation-state. The statement was introduced with the words &quot;maybe 
        this will sound crazy.&quot; It didn't draw much of a reaction, but I 
        certainly did not think it crazy. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The same idea was expressed in 1955 when Erich Fromm published 
        The Sane Society: &quot;'Nationalism' is our form of incest, is our idolatry, 
        is our insanity. 'Patriotism' is its cult. It should hardly be necessary 
        to say, that by 'patriotism' I mean that attitude which puts the own nation 
        above humanity, above the principles of truth and justice; not the loving 
        interest in one's own nation, which is the concern with the nation's spiritual 
        as much as with its material welfare- never with its power over other 
        nations.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The idea of the nation-state emerged with Italian and German 
        unification and the growing need to create a balance of power in Europe 
        in the 1800s. World War I was a strong confirmation of the nation-state, 
        but it wasn't until after World War II, when Hitler capitalized on German 
        nationalism that we saw a clear picture of the nation-state as an extremely 
        dangerous and destructive force.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For over two weeks now, we've been shaking our heads in 
        incredulity and sadness at all the losses we have suffered. Because America 
        has been attacked, we seem to feel that we have the right to turn around 
        and attack others, kill more people, thus giving justification to more 
        people to hate America. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We do all this in the name of nationalism and under the 
        auspices of doing the world a great favor. Terrorism, in the modern sense 
        of the word, has been a force in the world at least since the growth of 
        the nation-state. It has hit countless countries, but for whatever reasons, 
        those previous attacks didn't mean as much to us when they occurred as 
        they do now that our home soil has been attacked. So, we must rid the 
        earth of terrorism, no matter the cost. <br>
        The implication is that the lives of these terrorists are worth more than 
        the lives of the thousands of people who will die in this war. The implication 
        is that we are putting our country above everything and everyone else 
        in the world. The implication is that we are willingly starting a third 
        world war, not because we want to kill more people, but because the lives 
        of Americans are apparently valued more than the lives of Pakistanis, 
        of Afghanis, of Russians, and of people from other nations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, instead of turning inwards to address the &quot;concern 
        with the nation's spiritual welfare,&quot; we are going to turn outwards 
        to nurse our wounds. We seem to be intent on becoming the American Bully 
        who pushes other countries around in order to make himself feel better. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I'm sure I will be accused by some of being unpatriotic, 
        even as I proudly wear my red, white and blue. America represents an idea, 
        and it is that concept that inspires my patriotism, that freedom, that 
        truth, that justice?not the idea that puts Americans above others, but 
        the one that puts Americans among others, as friends, as kind givers, 
        and as exemplary leaders. </p>
