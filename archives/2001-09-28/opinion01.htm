        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last Thursday, Bowdoin College's leaders executed a great 
        idea. They gathered seven professors in Pickard Theater and invited members 
        of the college and local community to ask questions and make comments 
        about the ramifications of the September 11th terrorist attacks. The organizers 
        were even polite enough to erect a movie screen so that they could pause 
        and watch President Bush's speech and then comment on it. Unfortunately, 
        the seven panelists seemed only to represent one opinion. Not surprisingly, 
        the opinion was that of the liberal elite. Never before has the discord 
        between the academic community and the rest of the nation seemed so obvious.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Prior to Bush's speech, nothing at the &quot;Forum&quot; 
        bothered me. It actually seemed like a skeptical but understandable response 
        to what had taken place over the previous eight days. There were legitimate 
        concerns about hate crimes against Arab-Americans, US relations with moderate 
        Arab states, compliance with International Law, and trying to generate 
        an understanding as to why the attack happened. I felt that Dean McEwen's 
        caveat about recognizing the difference between &quot;explanation and 
        justification&quot; was a plenary observation that wisely set the parameters 
        for the discussion. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then President Bush spoke. He walked on stage with confidence, 
        determination, and a clear agenda. He spoke longer than his typical speeches, 
        with uncharacteristic eloquence and grace. It was an amazing speech that 
        covered almost every topic plaguing the minds of both the panelists and 
        the nation. Such topics included condemning hate crimes against Arab-Americans, 
        our relations with the rest of the world, and the purpose of this &quot;new 
        kind of war&quot;?spoken with inspiring vigor and patriotism. The media, 
        the Democratic party, and the American public were in unprecedented agreement 
        that it was a great speech and was exactly the kind of confidence boost 
        that the country needed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately that sense of confidence and inspiration did 
        not seem to please the Bowdoin elite. The aforementioned group was offended 
        when Bush uttered the words &quot;God is not neutral.&quot; A friend of 
        mine recalled hearing a person behind him expressing his offense that 
        the President had committed the cardinal sin of mixing church and state. 
        It was apparently of no consequence to this gentleman that every past 
        U.S. President, as well as the Founding Fathers, had expressed similar 
        benedictions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then some of the members in the audience joined the foray 
        of fallacious comments. One student suggested that our nation's response 
        is uncalled for because we don't react in kind when something like this 
        happens on another country's territory. For one thing, nothing like this 
        has ever happened anywhere. Never before have so many innocent civilians 
        died during a peacetime terrorist attack. Secondly, when &quot;smaller&quot; 
        tragedies occur, we do respond. Perhaps this student was unaware that 
        the United States Naval Academy ranks schools on its ability to produce 
        &quot;world leaders.&quot; Out of 3,000 schools on this list, Bowdoin 
        is ranked eighth. Just within the last 50 years this school produced famous 
        international figures such as George Mitchell, Bill Cohen, Thomas Pickering, 
        and Christopher Hill. Not only does the United States intervene in places 
        like Northern Ireland, the Baltics, and Israel, but Bowdoin alumni are 
        on the front lines. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Somebody also tried to make the argument that we don't know 
        poverty, and since poverty is the reason the extremists resort to such 
        heinous acts of violence, we are somehow disqualified from passing judgment. 
        Apparently this student doesn't look around much when he drives through 
        Brunswick or other parts of America. There is unfortunately plenty of 
        poverty in this country. Fortunately, our government, private charity, 
        and economic freedom give people the opportunity to move out of the slough 
        of destitution. Afghanistan is a poor country, but they are not poor because 
        of us. We sent them aid and helped international relief efforts until 
        the Taliban started kicking UN workers out, arresting Christian missionaries, 
        and murdering women in public executions. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the end of the evening, I confronted the panel and audience 
        on their inability not only to recognize the concern that the President 
        showed for their issues, but the inspiration and confidence in his speech. 
        A professor curtly responded that &quot;he's inspiring because he keeps 
        things simple.&quot; This inappropriate retort confirmed what I had suspected 
        all along. This &quot;forum&quot; was not really an open-minded debate 
        with respectful differences of opinion. Although I respect many of the 
        professors on the panel, the evening seemed like a number of closed-minded 
        people hiding behind the veil of being &quot;open-minded&quot; and &quot;liberal.&quot; 
        The President addressed their concerns in his speech, and has a cabinet 
        of experts with combat and classroom experience who have not and will 
        not act without considering the full consequences of every action. It 
        is sad that those who promulgate opinions that differ from 91 percent 
        of Americans and their government are not humble enough to recognize that 
        the freedom our country is fighting for consists of the fundamental rights 
        that allow them to disagree and not be shot.</p>
