      <p align="left">Reports indicated this week that Amtrak's long-delayed Portland 
        to Boston train service is finally beginning to take shape eight years 
        after the original prospectus date of 1993. The Portland-Boston route 
        reigns supreme as the longest-delayed passenger rail service project in 
        Amtrak history.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Several steps are being taken to expedite the opening date 
        of the new rail line, including the construction of two train terminals 
        on Sewall Street in Portland. In addition, the new rail line is being 
        tested to ensure that it satisfies new federal safety standards.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The line safety test, conducted by a federal transportation 
        board, began Wednesday of this week.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The transformed Concord Railways bus station will house 
        the first of the Amtrak train terminals. The station is presently being 
        renovated to handle the expected increase in passenger traffic.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second of the terminal facilities will serve as a layover 
        terminal where trains will be maintained and cleaned when not in service.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When in service, the 114-mile route from Portland to Boston 
        will take approximately two and a half hours with the train traveling 
        at about 79 mph. The route will include three stops in Maine south of 
        Portland: Wells, Saco, and Old Orchard Beach. It will also include three 
        stops in New Hampshire on the way to Boston.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The excitement concerning the opportunities associated with 
        the new Boston to Portland rail line has also extended to Brunswick. Officials 
        are considering the possibility that the steps taken this week to solidify 
        the planned Portland-Boston route have increased the likelihood that a 
        future rail line will extend into Brunswick. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Theo Holtwijk, Brunswick director of Planning and Development, 
        discussed the hopes of town planners to construct a train station near 
        Cook's Corner, which he said would be &quot;a stone's throw from campus.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Holtwijk offered insight as to when Bowdoin students and 
        Brunswick residents might hope to have the new Maine train line opened 
        to them: &quot;[The line will arrive in] at least a year, more like two 
        or three because of the work that needs to be done on the tracks and stations.&quot; 
        The tracks running through Brunswick are now used for slow-speed freight 
        and would need to be updated to support high-speed passenger trains. The 
        state of Maine has set aside $40-50 million to improve tracks such as 
        those running through Brunswick.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though the possibility of boarding a train and arriving 
        in Brunswick may still be distant, the developments this week concerning 
        the Portland-Boston line have come as welcome news for town planners and 
        residents.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A vast majority of Bowdoin students must often rely on other 
        forms of transportation in order to travel to and from Brunswick, due 
        to a variety of circumstances.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many students hail from distances that are often unmanageable 
        by car, and the possession of a vehicle on campus is a luxury that only 
        a small fraction of the student body enjoys.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shaken by the tragic events of September 11, many of America's 
        travelers, (college students included) have begun to look beyond airline 
        flights to reach their final destination. In their searches, many passengers 
        decide instead to depend on rail transportation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) has 
        reported that ridership aboard cross-country trains has increased 40 percent 
        since the events in New York City, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C., 
        occurred earlier this month.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Holtwijk said, &quot;You can't get to Brunswick without 
        getting to Portland first.&quot;</p>
