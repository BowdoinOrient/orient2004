      <p>A young Bowdoin football team discovered last Saturday that taking one 
        play off can be the difference between a win and a loss. From the line 
        of scrimmage, Middlebury's Bill Lazzaro broke through the Polar Bear defense 
        and sprinted 74 yards to the end zone in the game's first play. This play 
        proved to be pivotal, as the Panthers held a 7-0 lead into halftime.<br>

      <p>&quot;We're very frustrated. We feel we shot ourselves in the foot on 
        that first play,&quot; said co-captain Leroy Gaines '02. He echoed the 
        entire defense's frustration; a defense that played a superb game, with 
        the exception of one key breakdown.<br>
        The Bear's missed tackles on Lazzaro and a blocked punt led to two Panther 
        touchdowns, which would prove to be the margin of victory for Middlebury.<br>
        Junior quarterback Justin Hardison completed 19 of 32 passes for 129 yards. 
        After orchestrating an 11-play drive, Hardinson also scored Bowdoin's 
        lone touchdown on a quarterback sneak with 10:47 remaining in the game. 
        The Panthers finished the matchup atop a 21-7 score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Game mistakes are often the product of youth. Middlebury's squad is comprised 
        of mainly upperclassmen, but the Polar Bear team is a much younger one 
        this season. At one point of the game, five of eleven Bowdoin defenders 
        were first years, an occurence virtually unheard of in NESCAC.<br>
        However, captain Gaines and Head Coach Dave Caputi indicated that the 
        mistakes made on Saturday cannot be attributed solely to youthful inexperience. 
        Both were impressed by the play of the team's first years. &quot;They 
        made some first-year mistakes, but I was very pleased,&quot; Caputi said.<br>
        According to the head coach, offensive linemen Shaun Gagnon and Greg Barry, 
        along with defenders Jesse Demers and Jarrett Young, representing the 
        class of 2005, all had strong games. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Gaines echoed his coach's sentiment. &quot;We asked a lot of the younger 
        players, and I thought they played great,&quot; he said. &quot;I was impressed 
        by how they stepped it up on the field. We're going to depend on them 
        this year because of numbers.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Gaines plays next to Andrius Knasas '02 on the line, and said that he 
        was a bright spot in the Polar Bear defense on Saturday. &quot;He had 
        a great game,&quot; Gaines stated. &quot;He played well last season, but 
        I think he's going to have an amazing year and surprise people.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In talking about the matchup, Coach Caputi also singled out Knasas and 
        Gaines for their strong play against Middlebury.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Caputi had mixed feelings post-game, both pleased and disappointed with 
        the team's offensive execution. &quot;We did a good job putting together 
        a 17-play drive, but we didn't convert,&quot; he said. &quot;It was great 
        to be able to engineer the drive, but we need to capitalize.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Capitalizing upon scoring opportunities is a major Bear goal for tomorrow's 
        game. According to Gaines, the men's &quot;game plan is to stay in shape 
        this week. Amherst has some great running backs, and possibly the best 
        wide receiver in the NESCAC. We'll have to play against our own fatigue 
        on defense.&quot;<br>
        &quot;We're regrouping pretty well [from the Midd loss],&quot; Caputi 
        said. &quot;It's important for our kids to know how close we were to success, 
        and also how far away we put ourselves with some simple mistakes.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears' next contest won't be an easy one, as the Lord Jeffs from 
        Amherst finished in a tie for the NESCAC championship last year with Middlebury 
        and Colby.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In order for Bowdoin to be victorious in tomorrow's hostile environment 
        away from home, the men will have to eliminate what every coach hates: 
        missed opportunities. As Caputi said, &quot;We had opportunities to make 
        big plays and we didn't. [Middlebury] turned them into big plays, we didn't.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>As the Polar Bears learned last weekend, every play can turn into a big 
        play. Hopefully, their learning will aid their battle tomorrow at 1:30 
        P.M.</p>
