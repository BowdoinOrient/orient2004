        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Recently overheard: &quot;This weekend was ok. But the party 
        at ______ blew because there were just all these freshmen sluts.&quot; 
        Let's take a step back now and examine this statement. Clearly the speaker 
        was not happy with some of the first-year students (let's assume they 
        were female) who chose to attend the same party that she herself attended. 
        She was so unimpressed by them that she called them &quot;sluts&quot;. 
        Now, what, exactly, is a slut? We have all heard the word used many times 
        in many contexts. &quot;I hate her-what a slut&quot;. &quot;Dude, she 
        was so all over me I had to push her away. She was such a slut&quot;. 
        &quot;I don't want all those little sluts taking away our guys!&quot; 
        And most commonly, &quot;Dumb slut!&quot; Without getting all worked up, 
        as this question can tend to make people, I really would like to figure 
        this out once and for all. WHAT IS A SLUT? WHAT MAKES SOMEONE A SLUT?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Random House Webster's College Dictionary: slut (slut), 
        n. 1. a dirty, slovenly woman. 2. a. a sexually immoral woman. b. a prostitute. 
        Now, let us give the freshmen girls at said party the benefit of the doubt: 
        while they may not have been impeccably attired, they were probably not 
        dirty and/or too slovenly. And they are probably not &quot;hired&quot; 
        women. So why did this upperclassmen think that they were all sexually 
        promiscuous? Or did she? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps she just wanted to insult them. Beth was recently 
        telling me about one of her classes in which they discussed this very 
        issue of 'slut'. &quot;What we learned was that a long time ago female 
        slaves were used for sex so that was the very lowest a woman could get. 
        When people use that phrase now, they just want to demean someone to the 
        very lowest level possible. At this point, girls use it as a non-specific 
        insult all the time.&quot; True, in that I have heard many girls be called 
        sluts who have probably had one boyfriend their whole life, been extremely 
        faithful to him and have never even hit on another male. But if one of 
        these girls steals someone's spot on a team, she may risk being called 
        a slut. &quot;I know I'm guilty of it,&quot; Beth admitted, &quot;if I 
        don't like someone there's a very good chance I will call her a slut.&quot; 
        I interjected, &quot;My friends call each other sluts all the time and 
        they're just kidding.&quot; Beth pointed out that we must, in understanding 
        this usage of the word, understand that all insults will inevitably be 
        used jokingly among friends even if they also employ them without jest 
        in other instances. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Slut&quot; is most often used in reference to sexual 
        promiscuity though. It may be used to describe a girl who hooks up with 
        too many guys or goes too far with them This is generally a bad thing, 
        although there is a school of post-feminist thought that tells women that 
        it is important to 'use men's bodies as they use women's'. For subscribers 
        to this belief, &quot;slut&quot; may imply a wide range of sexual experience 
        with positive connotations. It can lend an air of wildness and liberty 
        to a girl and make her seem very fun and carefree, indicating that she's 
        just out to have a good time, not on the prowl for a boyfriend. This instance 
        tends to use the phrase &quot;a little slutty&quot; which is not as harsh 
        as the flat out &quot;slut&quot;. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another common usage is the term &quot;freshmen slut&quot; 
        (or sophomore slut, eighth grade slut, what have you). This clearly belies 
        insecurity on the part of the insult-er. Many times, the employer of the 
        term is worried that the new, younger girls will be prettier, skinnier, 
        more desirable and have more novelty that she and her friends and cause 
        them to fall out of favor with &quot;the guys&quot;. This is applied to 
        romantic scenarios. However, it may be applied as well as in the case 
        of Shannon confiding in me her fear that all of her good-looking, lacrosse- 
        and hockey-playing male friends will stop hanging out with her because 
        they will be so enchanted by the new girls (who clearly have no goal other 
        then to do anything and everything necessary to snag the coolest, hottest 
        guy there is and then use him for his social status). Moreover, any freshmen 
        or sophomore girl who is good friends with upper-class men risks this 
        stereotype. Also found: &quot;social-climbing slut&quot;. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Sluttiness&quot; is very often applied to something 
        as petty as outward appearances. Our kindergarten teachers told us never 
        to judge a book by its cover; nonetheless, prejudices are formed and labels 
        are applied, albeit removable, based on first impressions. A girl in a 
        tight, bright, cropped top and tight, low-cut pants dancing provocatively 
        (&quot;grinding&quot;) on the dance floor at a social house with multiple 
        guys risks being called a &quot;slut&quot;. She may have absolutely no 
        intention of doing any more than dancing that night, or any night for 
        that matter. Unfortunately for her, her looks and her actions imply that 
        she may, hence the application of the label. Even more unfortunate is 
        that she may be the closest thing on earth to the Virgin Mary but will 
        be called a slut, based on her appearance, before the most promiscuous 
        girl in the school who attends a party in khakis and a button-down. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In its latest incarnation, &quot;slut&quot; has been brought 
        to the other sex. A &quot;male slut&quot; or &quot;guy slut&quot; is not 
        quite a pimp or a player. He doesn't have &quot;game&quot; but somehow 
        manages to hook up with lots of girls. This does not pack nearly the same 
        punch as when it is used in reference to women.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Slut&quot; is clearly an insult in its most common 
        applications. It is meant to encompass all of the worst qualities a woman 
        can posses: lack of morals, lack of self-respect, lack of social-consciousness, 
        and inability to dress appropriately. It can be used to mean any one of 
        these, but the general intended effect is the whole combination. It may 
        be applied at random to anyone who rubs the speaker the wrong way. Unfortunately, 
        this makes the tern slightly indefinable and therefore unavoidable. So 
        that if you try your whole life to be pure and good, one action can deem 
        you a &quot;slut&quot;. So I say to Bowdoin College students, Be not so 
        liberal in your employment of this insult! It may very well be unfounded 
        and incur irreparable damage to some poor girl! And to those who have 
        been branded, Be proud! Embrace your sluttiness if need be! Do not stop 
        dancing or stop dressing as you like to cater to the whims of some jealous 
        senior girl! I say, as long as you are well aware of the image you project 
        and you don't mind, then go for it! Be a slut! <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Just don't ever call me one.</p>
