      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Improvabilities group is back in action this 
        year and ready for some unrehearsed fun. Four new members--sophomores 
        Hari Kondabolu and Brian Lorits, and first-years LaTricia Sealy and Jason 
        Long--were added this year. &quot;They were selected in accordance with 
        the following criteria,&quot; explained veteran member Matthew Roberts. 
        &quot;(1) Are they kind of funny? and (2) Are they weak and spineless 
        like us therefore leaving the delicate political balance within the group 
        undisturbed?&quot; New members: for meeting those daunting expectations 
        a proud school salutes you.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Improvabilities will dazzle Bowdoin audiences in their first 
        scheduled performance on Thursday, October 11. That same weekend, they 
        hope to have a workshop with the famed improvisational group Second City, 
        who will be performing on Parents' Weekend. Though Roberts admitted that 
        Second City is &quot;the greatest improvisational group in the country,&quot; 
        he added that Improvabilities is &quot;very excited about this wonderful 
        opportunity to meet one of the truly pioneering organizations in comedy 
        and expose it as a fraud.&quot; <br>
        The following are in-depth profiles of the individual members, brimming 
        with talent, that constitutes Improvabilities: <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hari Kondabolu is one of the new cast members on the Improvabilities 
        this year. People sometimes ask him, 'Hey H-man, why are you so goddamn 
        funny?' First, he responds, 'Don't ever call me H-<br>
        man.' Then he explains that he's funny because he's crazy. &quot;I have 
        severe psychological problems,&quot; he says unapologetically. &quot;Now 
        will someone please tell me why my pants are on that koala bear and why 
        he's eating all my Corn Pops!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nick Hiebert is a junior and is beginning his second year 
        with the group. He loves spending time at practice just messing around. 
        Shows are sort of icing on the cake. &quot;If we get other people to laugh 
        that's great; I just love that fact that we consistently crack each other 
        up. That's what I really enjoy about the group - however selfish that 
        is.&quot;</p>
      <p>Jason Long comes from the exotic and distant land of Southern Maine.<br>
        &quot;Please come to our shows,&quot; he begs, &quot;or I may have to 
        spend my time reading.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Matt Roberts is a junior from Falmouth, Maine beginning his third year 
        with the group. Though frightfully unfunny, Matt always manages to make 
        the other members laugh out of the fear that if they don't they'll damage 
        his extremely fragile self-confidence and send him into a fit of seething 
        rage. &quot;I'll do it!&quot; he says, clutching a gnarled teddy bear. 
        Matt also participates in drama and in his spare time, he enjoys playing 
        guitar and complaining about the Red Sox. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Clint Huston is one of two seniors on the team. &quot;I have a big forehead 
        and I<br>
        believe this is the source of most of my humor,&quot; he says. &quot;He 
        enjoys meat helmets, watching people kick their feet in the air, and breathing. 
        &quot;I have no<br>
        allergies and firmly believe in the truth. If I had one wish, I would<br>
        use it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>George Hubbard is well known as an international man of enigma. He now 
        <br>
        resides in Australia doing research for the Improvabilities. His favorite 
        past times include the world-renowned game show Physics Phun Phor Phriendly 
        Pharmers. His enjoyed foods include cheese. George can be recognized by 
        the constant chatter of spectators saying, &quot;Eight-year olds dude.&quot; 
        Just to set the record straight, he is not an activist against&quot;enjoying 
        the high life.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>LaTricia Sealy was known as Trishy because of her &quot;innocent appearance.&quot; 
        This quickly changed when the truth was revealed&#133; LaTricia stuck 
        until friends <br>
        realized how un-cool it is to call people by the names recorded on their 
        birth certificates. Here are the names she will most likely respond to: 
        LaTricia, Lattie, La, Trisha, Trish, Tushy and Tushi (there IS a difference), 
        Tush, Tush-Tush, Trixy-Trish, Sash, and Sashe (pronounced sash'ey). One 
        could also get her attention by spontaneously losing a limb.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Cabul Mehta is a junior from just outside Boston and lives in the fabulous<br>
        dream world known fondly as &quot;Camp Bobo.&quot; He spends much of his 
        time<br>
        trying to graduate by May 2003, but in his spare time he likes to socialize 
        and figure out why his computer &quot;keeps making that turtle-like buzzing 
        noise.&quot; In addition to being the best looking member of the group, 
        he brings to it his innate organizational skills that keep it alive with 
        vigor. Cabul's future plans include &quot;working like a drone in the 
        city&quot; and becoming the main reason Matt complains about the Red Sox.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Brian Laurits is a goat herd management major whose dreams and aspirations 
        include the Olympics, flying helicopters, and joining the band &quot;B*witched&quot; 
        for their upcoming world-wide come back (it will happen...oh yes, it will 
        happen). He hopes someday to be married and have kids, but chances are 
        that he won't, so he'll settle for whatever he gets.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Liz Wendell once played hide and seek. She was so good at hide and seek<br>
        that no one found her, try as they might. So they stopped playing but 
        did not tell her. And so she sat in her parents' closet inside the dress 
        bag, patiently. And she did sit and wait. Dinner passed. She took a nap. 
        At last when it had reached the wee hours of the morning, she emerged 
        disgruntled and unsettled. She will never play hide and seek after that 
        fateful day of June 3, 2001.</p>
