      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;My ex-girlfriend told me she was 
        diagnosed with genital warts and that she needed to be treated to prevent 
        cancer. She was a virgin when we met, which means she must have gotten 
        them from me. I've never had any STD as far as I know, and I'm feeling 
        pretty bad - and pretty worried - about all of this. What can you tell 
        me about genital warts?&quot;</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear Reader: Like all warts, genital warts are growths caused 
        by human papillomavirus (HPV). They are spread, almost always, through 
        sexual contact. Their incubation period is variable, ranging from a few 
        weeks to many months and even years. The vast majority of people infected 
        never develop any noticeable lesions. Available treatments for HPV do 
        not completely eliminate the virus, but for most people, infection is 
        probably transient and likely inconsequential. However, and by far most 
        importantly, some HPV infections are associated with serious long-term 
        effects. They may provoke cellular changes in the tissues of the cervix, 
        vagina, penis or anus. Over time, these changes may lead to cancer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Genital HPV infections are among the most common STDs world 
        wide, with the highest rate of infection found in women under the age 
        of 25. It is estimated that up to 75 percent of college-aged people harbor 
        HPV virus. Probably only 1 percent of those infected have visible warts. 
        An additional 4 percent may be diagnosed by cellular changes found on 
        screening Pap tests. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Over 100 types of HPV have been identified, about 30 of 
        which cause infection of genital mucosal sites. Viral DNA is incorporated 
        into infected cells and often remains unnoticed by the host's immune system. 
        Two of these types cause very noticeable, painless, &quot;cauliflower-like&quot; 
        growths. They are usually treated topically, with medications or cryotherapy 
        (freezing), with the aim of removing the lesions and also stimulating 
        an immune response to the infection. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Two other types of HPV, numbers 16 and 18, cause the cellular 
        changes that can be pre-cancerous. They sometimes cause small, flat growths 
        to appear, which can look very much like normal &quot;skin bumps&quot;. 
        More often, however, there are no lesions to be seen. The oncogenic role 
        of these two types of HPV is so prominent, that gynecologists sometimes 
        regard cervical cancer as a virtual STD. HPV 16 and 18 are found in over 
        99 percent of women with invasive cervical cancer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">HPV 16 and 18 are also strongly associated with anal and 
        rectal cancers, and regular screening anal pap tests are recommended for 
        those at risk (from unprotected anal sex.)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The clinical course of HPV infection can be significantly 
        affected by a number of factors. Immune function compromise (from certain 
        medications or HIV, for instance) usually results in higher viral loads, 
        more lesions, more rapid progression and oncogenic transformation of lesions, 
        and higher rates of viral transmission. Cigarette smoking has similar 
        effects.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are no blood tests to detect HPV infection. The best 
        screening tests are Pap tests, both cervical, and if indicated, anal. 
        If these tests are positive, the infections can be treated, even if there 
        are no visible lesions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Because of its long incubation period and the potential 
        presence of the virus without prior sexual activity, it's rarely possible 
        to determine the original source of infection. None of the types of HPV 
        which cause common warts on hands and feet can be spread to the genitals. 
        Like herpes, HPV does not survive long on inanimate objects and so cannot 
        be contracted, for instance, from toilet seats.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Safer sex practices remain essential to preventing transmission 
        of HPV. Consistent condom use is key. Regular check-ups and Pap tests 
        are equally important. Come on in to see us at the Health Center!<br>
