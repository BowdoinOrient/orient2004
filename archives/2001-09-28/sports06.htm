      <p>What is up with sports stars retiring while they are still in their prime? 
        Why are sports heroes and icons hanging up their skates, cleats, or sneakers 
        after a year of performing at an elite level?</p>
      <p>Peter Forsberg, who is generally considered the best two-way center in 
        the National Hockey League and a cog in the Colorado Avalanche lineup, 
        held a press conference recently announcing his indefinite retirement 
        from the league. He cited a rash of injuries over the years, including 
        a ruptured spleen and shoulder injuries, that have deterred his will and 
        his ability to play at an optimum level.</p>
      <p>Last season, Forsberg was the most dynamic player in hockey by combing 
        an elegance and nimbleness with brute strength and muscle. No other player 
        in the NHL was more difficult to contain or unnerve.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, after his 27-goal, 62-assist season, this Swede walked away 
        from the hockey world - temporarily at least - at the top of his game. 
        Even more disheartening is the fact that &quot;Peter The Great&quot; only 
        began to realize his full potential as a goal-scoring, pretty-passing, 
        hard-checking player.</p>
      <p>Forsberg's sudden and unexpected retirement is not an anomaly in the 
        sports world, however. Instead, it is increasingly becoming common-fare 
        to watch a great athlete walk away while on top.</p>
      <p>Other future hall-of-famers that prematurely chose to end their careers 
        include running back Barry Sanders, center Mario Lemieux, and shooting-guard 
        Michael Jordan. </p>
      <p>After rushing for 2,053 yards in 1997 and 1,491 yards in 1998, Sanders 
        opted for retirement and Coors Original commercials instead of chasing 
        Walter Paytons all-time rushing record. Even though he was in supreme 
        condition, Sanders made the sharpest cut of his career in 1999 when he 
        told the football world that he would not be back.</p>
      <p>He cited his gripes with the Detroit Lions organization as a principle 
        reason for his actions, but he still was arguably the best back in the 
        league. Why did he bolt?</p>
      <p>And then there are the athletes who retire early and comeback for the 
        love of the game or to prove that they are still one of the best.</p>
      <p>Mario Lemieux, the most skilled hockey player in the world next to Wayne 
        Gretzky, scored 50 goals and totaled 72 assists in the 1997 season. To 
        celebrate his success, he too retired. </p>
      <p>The hockey god explained to fans that the chronic problems with his back 
        simply were too painful to fight. Walking away was the only option.</p>
      <p>During this past season, Mario decided that his back was in good enough 
        shape to resume his career, and he responded by playing as if he had never 
        missed a beat. Once again he was routinely skating around led-footed defenders 
        and making goalies look silly while making teammates look great. </p>
      <p>The ultimate example of an athlete leaving on top is Michael Jordan - 
        who did it twice! Essentially, Jordan took a year and a half in the middle 
        of his six NBA Championships. Then, in 1998 after number six, MJ declared 
        that he was retiring and was 99.9% certain that he would never return.</p>
      <p>And now, Jordan figures to help the 19-63 Washington Wizards return to 
        respectability (or get there for the first time) after a three-year lay 
        off. If he can still play at an elite level, Jordan will have taken a 
        combined four and a half years off from the game that he loves. But, why?</p>
      <p>I have several theories, or &quot;strains in the old duder's head,&quot; 
        that may shed some light into this phenomenon.</p>
      <p>First of all, now that players are making more money than ever, players 
        do not depend on their salaries like they once did. After taking in a 
        10 million dollar signing bonus or signing a mega-million advertising 
        deal, it is no longer necessary to play for money.</p>
      <p>Because athletes are not pushed by any economic necessity, they don t 
        feel the same desire to continue to subject themselves to the wear and 
        tear of a long season. They have already proved their unparalleled athletic 
        prowess and can walk away conscience-free.</p>
      <p>Or maybe, this economic theory is not getting at the heart of matters 
        (because its the heart that matters most). With players stronger and better 
        conditioned than ever before, playing a sport at the professional level 
        is a more grueling act than in days of yore.</p>
      <p>Players simply can no longer or are not willing to absorb the same punishment 
        for as long as they once did.</p>
      <p>Or maybe, it's the fear of holding on too long and tarnishing a legacy. 
        Muhammad Ali was a human punching bag later in his career - all it earned 
        him was major headaches and exposed him as merely human.</p>
      <p>While these three theories seem plausible-enough, I do not believe that 
        they explain the current situation in sports.</p>
      <p>Instead, the definition of success has evolved - for the good or the 
        bad. No longer do players, fans, or analysts judge a player's effectiveness 
        in terms on longevity. Walter Payton, for example, is regarded as the 
        best running back in NFL history because he played at a high level for 
        so many years and rushed for an unprecedented 16,000 yards total. </p>
      <p>However, players like Eric Dickerson and Bo Jackson were better pure 
        runners than Payton, but old age and injuries cut their careers short. 
        As a result, they are not remembered in NFL lore as the best ever.</p>
      <p>In the modern era, however, longevity is deemphasized. Instead of quantity 
        being equally as important as quality, todays sports world values quality 
        more than quantity.</p>
      <p>Because of this fundamental change, players, like Forsberg, don t feel 
        the need to play through injuries to prove themselves as great. Why risk 
        further injury and continue to sacrifice?</p>
      <p>We already accept them as heroes.<br>
