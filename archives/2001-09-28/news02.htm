      <p align="left">A walk around campus clearly demonstrates two things: first, 
        that Bowdoin has improved its degree of diversity significantly in recent 
        years, and second, the College still has a long way to go. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Every year, Bowdoin's new students come from increasingly 
        different regions, ethnicities, and traditions. While there remains a 
        good deal of room for further improvement, efforts to recruit students 
        of color have been successful of late.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'm really proud of the College; I've seen so much 
        progress over nine years,&quot; said Fumio Sugihara, Assistant Dean of 
        Admissions and Director of Recruitment for Students of Color. &quot;The 
        flavor and feel of the campus are very different from that of the past.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sugihara graduated from Bowdoin in 1996, and began working 
        in the admissions office shortly thereafter. &quot;I think that now, students 
        believe in diversity. We're making strides.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College runs several programs geared toward recruiting 
        students of varied backgrounds. &quot;We have two visitation programs 
        in the fall, called Bowdoin Invitationals,&quot; Dean of Admissions Jim 
        Miller said. &quot;We invite students of color from all over the country 
        and bring them on campus for a few days.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to the Invitationals, the College runs a spring 
        program for students who have applied to Bowdoin. &quot;The Bowdoin Experience 
        is an event where we bring in a lot of students who we really want to 
        come here,&quot; Miller said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The dean indicated that programs of this sort have aided 
        the admissions office in drawing students to Bowdoin and increasing the 
        College's diversity. &quot;They have worked very well,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;I think it's important that people have a chance to see this place 
        and interact with our students and faculty.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Miller also said that the College's diversity-enhancing 
        efforts are revised frequently. &quot;We meet every year to think about 
        the best way to reach students of color, and all students,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;It is always on the forefront to build a student body of diversity 
        and distinction.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Clearly, these efforts are making a difference. The Class 
        of 2005 was the most diverse in Bowdoin's history, a title usually usurped 
        each year by subsequent classes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, according to statistics provided by Registrar 
        Christine Brooks Cote, students of color remain at Bowdoin at rates comparable 
        to the general student body. The overall sophomore retention rate, between 
        the years of 1996-2003, varied from 92 to 96 percent. For students of 
        color, the rate was between 88 and 100 percent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cote said that another means of measuring the College's 
        retention of students is its six-year graduation rate, which indicates 
        the percentage of entering students that finish within six years. For 
        the 1994-1998 period, Bowdoin's overall six-year rate was between 88 and 
        91 percent; for students of color, it was between 79 and 96 percent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There is really no discernible difference,&quot; said 
        Craig Bradley, Dean of Student Affairs. &quot;The retention rates are 
        just about the same.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;In some years, they are higher for students of color, 
        and in some they are lower,&quot; Cote said. &quot;They balance out.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sugihara said that the students of color currently on campus 
        are an important indication of Bowdoin's progress. &quot;In terms of enthusiasm 
        and recognition of diversity's importance, it's there,&quot; Sugihara 
        said. &quot;But we're still working on it. We have to struggle to come 
        to an understanding of it, and our discussion still needs to be broadened.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With the yearly evaluations, changes and different ideas 
        about the College's diversity efforts emerge. Miller indicated that, in 
        future years, he wants to use a relatively untapped resource to further 
        improve the student body's composition: &quot;Bowdoin has very enthusiastic 
        alumni,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe very much that we need to engage 
        our graduates more heavily in the recruitment cycle.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We need to get more national as an institution, and, 
        to an extent, to look more internationally,&quot; he added. &quot;We don't 
        have enough staff and resources to reach out across the country, and we 
        need the alums for that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The recruitment events mentioned above will be utilized 
        again in the 2001-2002 school year, with a few adjustments. According 
        to Sugihara, some logistical changes have been made to the fall Invitational 
        program. &quot;In light of the recent tragedy, we've modified the October 
        [session],&quot; he said. &quot;We won't be flying in students in October; 
        we'll be using buses and trains in the New England and Mid-Atlantic areas.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're still planning the Bowdoin Experience [as normal] 
        for the spring,&quot; he added.</p>
