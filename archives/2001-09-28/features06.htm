      <p align="left">As William Pitt Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1823, prepared 
        to depart his beloved state of Maine for the United States House of Representatives 
        in 1841, another Bowdoin graduate was winding down his stay in the District 
        of Columbia. Franklin Pierce, Bowdoin class of 1824 and son to the Revolutionary 
        War General Benjamin Pierce, had enjoyed a pleasant life after graduating 
        from Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce married Jane Means Appleton, daughter of former Bowdoin 
        president Jesse Appleton in 1834. It was a strange and tragic love affair 
        for both of them since Jane Appleton suffered from both physical and psychological 
        problems. In addition to this the future president's wife also had an 
        extreme aversion to politics and politicians. Their marriage was not helped 
        by the fact that their first two children died while they were relatively 
        young. But whatever the tragedies and issues, Jane Appleton stayed with 
        Franklin Pierce until her dying day.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce served two terms in the House of Representatives, 
        arriving in time to witness President Andrew Jackson's war on the Bank 
        of the United States. His time in the House was spent dealing with committees, 
        boundary disputes, the independence of Texas, and in time, the rise of 
        the abolitionist sentiment. In 1837 Pierce became a Senator and with his 
        personal hatred for the abolitionist cause guiding him, he began an unimpressive 
        career in the Senate. It was here that he stayed until his resignation 
        in 1842, a year after William Pitt Fessenden came to Washington.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden was not new to the District of Columbia. He had 
        been there before but for good measure, his father, General Samuel Fessenden 
        rode with him to the nation's capital in May of 1841. After his election, 
        rumors began to grow that Fessenden was an abolitionist. This was probably 
        due to his father's influence that Samuel Fessenden was the leader of 
        the abolitionist movement in the state of Maine. Young Pitt, however, 
        publicly proclaimed that, &quot;I am not and never have been a member 
        of any Abolition Society.&quot; Fessenden was certainly no southern sympathizer 
        but he also believed, like Lincoln, that radical abolitionism was not 
        the way to go.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the election of 1840, the Whigs had successfully placed 
        one of their own in power. William Henry Harrison, a well-known soldier 
        and the Whig candidate had won the White House. Things were looking up 
        for the disorganized and divided party, until their president-elect fell 
        ill and died a month into his first term. The vice-president, Virginian 
        John Tyler was thus placed in President Harrison's vacated chair. While 
        Tyler had proclaimed himself a Whig, he was really more of a Democrat, 
        and thus the break that the Whig leaders had hoped for was denied them 
        once again.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden served on the House Committee on Naval Affairs 
        and began to flex his financial muscles. He spoke in favor of a bill that 
        would increase national security. The border dispute between Maine and 
        Great Britain was still in the air, and Fessenden certainly did not want 
        to be unprepared should the empire turn its guns on young America once 
        again. Knowing when to save, as well as spend, Fessenden voted against 
        a bill that would have given a substantial sum of money to the defense 
        of Portland harbor forts. Fessenden argued that there had been no request 
        for such money and giving the money away would be a simple waste. Obviously 
        his friends in Maine did not see eye to eye with him and a few questioned 
        his intentions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For the rest of his time in Washington, Fessenden felt more 
        and more disgusted with life in the capital city. Whigs bickered amongst 
        themselves, fought the President and basically spelled their own doom. 
        Fessenden was disappointed in his party members and was further disgusted 
        by the actions of southern politicians, especially Virginians. He considered 
        them to be spoiled, &quot;selfish, hair-splitting, senseless animals.&quot; 
        And he considered the President, &quot;the weakest of the lot.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1843 Fessenden left Washington to return home to his 
        beloved Portland. A year earlier, Franklin Pierce had retired from the 
        Senate and returned to a life of practicing law as well. There would be 
        a long lull in the life of Pitt Fessenden, but Pierce would see action 
        soon enough as the United States prepared to go to war with Mexico.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Elsewhere, across the Atlantic Ocean two American tourists, 
        having a grand time in the countries of Europe, had an unexpected delay 
        in Florence, Italy. It was here in 1841, while Fessenden and Pierce were 
        winding down their early political careers, that Thomas Worchester Hyde 
        was born.<br>
