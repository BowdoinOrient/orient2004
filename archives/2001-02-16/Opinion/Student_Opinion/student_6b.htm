      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As we circle the globe, peoples' conceptions of "wilderness" 
        varies. For instance, the people of Sweden have been protective of land 
        for multiple decades, while we in the U.S. have been catching up over 
        the past few decades. On the other end of the spectrum, some people in 
        the Pacific Northwest still hunt endangered animals, burn forests, and 
        pollute the atmosphere. They are on a totally different page than the 
        rest of the world. Unfortunately, nations have difficulty agreeing on 
        nuclear weapons, much less on a tree or two. Therefore, "wilderness," 
        its definition, and its protection are at the bottom of the totem pole. 
        Perhaps we need to change the order, for if we keep the life we lead as 
        of now, there will be little worthy land left over which to fight. Perhaps 
        it is time to have a look at "wilderness." Lobbying groups are starting 
        to get the ear of Congress, but we are still a long way from home.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; My thoughts on "wilderness" are many and diverse. One side 
        of me says that we need to block off land. It should be a place where 
        people leave only footprints. Where man is a visitor. But what can be 
        said to Native Americans who have lived their whole lives in harmony with 
        this wilderness? Should they be under the same jurisdiction as the waste 
        dumping corporate slobs that so often infect the wastelands? I believe 
        that the answer to the "Man Question" is the following: No man shall be 
        allowed to live in any area of the wilderness, despite cultural history. 
        However, all Native Americans who hold a legitimate claim to the newly 
        appointed "wilderness" area should be afforded with rights that go beyond 
        others in society, which would give them the opportunity to live with 
        and partake in the land on a part-time basis. But for many that is absurd. 
        Native Americans have no understanding of what we mean by "wilderness," 
        they understand "forest" and "home," but the concept of a "forest that 
        is not home" is completely foreign to them.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In my book, in order for a land to be considered a "wilderness," 
        it must have a few traits. It must have character. That is to say, it 
        cannot be ordinary, it must be unique in some way. 'But Harlem is very 
        unique!' you say? Well, another parameter is that it must be completely 
        natural and there can be no sign of humans. No signs saying "Pick up after 
        yourselves." No wrappers nor bottles. No food, save what grows in that 
        environment naturally. No bathrooms. All of the previous are the amenities 
        of man and, thereby, have no role in my conception of "wilderness." It 
        is a place where you utterly overwhelmed by nature.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Another aspect of "wilderness" for me is a mainly mental 
        aspect. It is a very real danger. To live in a "wilderness" you need to 
        know how to survive, to visit, you need to know the basics. The concept 
        of a "wilder-ness," a somewhere that is wilder than ourselves, the place 
        we come from. It's a place we've neither conquered in heart or body. It's 
        intimidating and challenging, but none is more rewarding. Perhaps it is 
        even a place where we feel lost. Wilderness is a place where the path 
        ends and the unknown begins.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, to have one of the aforementioned characteristics 
        and not to have all of the others is to not fall under my conception of 
        a "wilderness." It is crucial to my understanding that the lands in question 
        maintain all of these parameters.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In order for our natural lands to remain, we must, sad as 
        it is, define them. Although further education in classrooms regarding 
        the degradation of land and its devastating effects will aid future generations 
        in this fight, there is little that can be done at the root of the problem 
        for the generation that is in control of our government. Therefore, we 
        must go to our secondary resource: that which defines "wilderness" and 
        thereby protects it from the heathens. First, the question of how to deal 
        with the mental and physical understandings of "wilderness" must be answered. 
        Following this, the question of the presence of man or lack thereof must 
        be decided upon. Afterwards, the rules and regulations, that have exceptions 
        built into them, must be created, and then, more importantly, implemented 
        and thoroughly enforced. These steps will lead to others that will bring 
        us closer and closer to the desired definition of wilderness.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The questions that arise from all previous come in torrents. 
        The flow has been started. Can "wilderness" be defined by us? Can individuals 
        define "wilderness" beyond their own boundaries of personal experience, 
        personality, and culture? Is "wilderness" anything more than a law and 
        a few park rangers?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wilderness" can be a great thing. It can help people to 
        grow, it can soothe, it can provide, it can exist and flourish. We need 
        it. Not just to visit and relax. But to know that it's there. To remember 
        that there are places of this earth not of asphalt and brick, with oil 
        streaks and yellow lines. A place without screaming, stock quotes, greasy 
        dollar bills, and astro-turf. We need to have that place in our minds 
        and hearts. If we continue to work at it, we can save these wonderful 
        lands. We can define and protect those lands which are so endangered right 
        now. We can turn "wilderness" back into wilderness. </p>
