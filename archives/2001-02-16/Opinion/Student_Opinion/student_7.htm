      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spring fever. It's February 13 and I wish it was 
        May (I would say April but you and I both know that the glacier that is 
        our quad will still be melting then). Realistically, I know it's way too 
        early to be thinking spring, far too soon to be craving the sunlight that 
        I see occasionally piercing the sky. But I can't help it-a day of above 
        freezing temps and melting snowbanks, and I'm all set to lose the winter 
        coat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There's something about a trickle of water dripping across 
        the sidewalk that immediately awakens that urge for summer. I'm not sure 
        what it is, but as temperatures warmed this past Saturday and ice crystals 
        began to lose their form, the thought of spring suddenly pounced upon 
        me. Not even the cold, bitter winds that blew in on Sunday and recaptured 
        all the ice crystals could nullify that urge for Spring. The sun is too 
        high in the sky now, it's warmth just starting to become noticeable on 
        my frozen cheeks, for complacency to settle for these last winter months. 
        I want spring, and I want it now.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried to determine why I seem to be so anxious for spring. 
        Most people around campus still seem content with these winter days. Not 
        me. The sunny days that have graced our campus have only teased our senses, 
        for I know as soon as I step outside the coldness of winter will be the 
        first to greet me. A change of seasons is what we need here, a stretch 
        of weather to lift our spirits and remind us that life can really exist 
        outside. No more snowstorms, no more ice, just sun and a little warmth 
        to greet us.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But we're all Maineiacs, accustomed to these long winters 
        and lack of springs. But I think I chose the wrong state for college. 
        I should have chosen the ones that had spring checked off in a column 
        right after it. Yes, my beloved Pennsylvania has flowers and April showers. 
        We have snowballs and April snow showers. I suppose our groundhog mascot 
        should have clued me into the fact that Maine was no spring lover's state. 
        In fact, I'm not a polar bear. Who am I kidding? I should have chosen 
        a school with a Canadian goose as its mascot-at least they fly south every 
        winter.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know exactly what triggered my seasonal clock to 
        flip out this past week, for it to scream spring while winter ticks away. 
        I suppose it's a lack of vitamins. Yes, Fred Flintstone chewables can 
        only suffice as a replacement for the sun's Vitamin D for so long. Or 
        maybe it was the series of mini- heart attacks I've had in the "almost" 
        falls this past week. But I think it was the notice of the songbirds that 
        have begun to return to this frozen state, begging winter to let go her 
        grip, that really grabbed my attention. I know it's only the middle of 
        February, but this polar bear can only take the Arctic tundra for so long.</p>
