      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright, this is the largest amount of time that I've ever 
        dedicated to an article. I started this list over Christmas break, when 
        daytime VH1 was jammed with the Hundred Greatest albums, rock songs, women 
        rockers, one hit wonders, Beatles songs, musical drug references, etc. 
        I found myself pretty fed up with the redundancy and predictability of 
        these endless lists. So, in a burst of inspiration, right there on my 
        couch in Saint Louis, I began a list of my own Top 100. I decided to do 
        Daniel's Top 100, but my Top 100 wouldn't be so trivial as the lists on 
        VH1. I mean, big surprise, The Beatles and the Rolling Stones basically 
        consist of the top ten, maybe a Led Zeppelin or two, and maybe an Aretha 
        Franklin, maybe.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In my own private and exclusive social circles, I am often 
        ridiculed for my "music snobbery," so it seemed only fitting that I fight 
        the cable TV establishment, and start my own. By this time, the Orient 
        had already expressed great interest in my project. They were kind enough 
        to front a healthy sum to aid in my research, and agreed to a substantial 
        bonus, pending the publication of my ground-breaking list.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't just list every song that I enjoy "rocking out" 
        to, so I decided that it would be necessary to formulate some sort of 
        criteria. The songs had to fit into at least one of my two categories: 
        songs had to be the work either of musicians you probably wouldn't hear 
        on the radio, or of artists you might hear on the radio, but songs of 
        theirs that you probably wouldn't, or haven't, heard. Some are B-sides, 
        some are unreleased, some are the live covers of other bands. But soak 
        them up while Napster is still around. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A few more things: I didn't rank them, I couldn't. While 
        I do claim vast, superior musical knowledge, I don't feel I have the ability 
        to place The Sex Pistols over Sly and the Family Stone, or Chuck Berry 
        over Bob Dylan. That's the other thing: I tried to avoid Dylan, the Stones, 
        the Beatles, etc. but their music (despite VH1's extreme dependence) is 
        so damn good, I had to throw in a few. But you might not have heard these 
        songs, and, no one is represented more than twice. No one except Woody 
        Guthrie. I know, country huh? Yeah, there are a few country titles in 
        there, but just as Neil Young is the godfather of grunge, Woody Guthrie 
        is the godfather of music as we know it today. He made music for the American 
        people, and whether you hear that in the pop songs of Third Eye Blind 
        or Sugar Ray, or in the jams of Phish or Widespread Panic, Woody's mentality 
        is there. Music for the masses, a sort of Socialist approach.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't rightly know what to call this list, except my Top 
        100. There's some punk, some country, and some reggae, then there's some 
        music that tends to bleed across all categories, and that defies labeling. 
        Listen to what you can get your hands on, Napster is fading fast.</p>
