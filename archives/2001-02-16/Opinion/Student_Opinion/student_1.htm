      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to turn on the news or open a newspaper these 
        days without seeing a politician blathering on about the wonders of bipartisan 
        cooperation. From President George Bush to Democratic Senate Minority 
        leader Tom Daschle, our nation's leaders seem to be stumbling over one 
        another to see who can be the most conciliatory. Even fiery House Whip 
        Tom Delay, who once compared the EPA to the Gestapo, gave a speech to 
        some of his Republican colleagues on the importance of cooperating with 
        House Democrats. Zell Miller, a Democratic senator from Georgia, has gone 
        as far as to endorse the Bush tax plan. Whether hoping to get political 
        mileage by looking accommodating or actually true believers, the US Congress 
        has made the big collective leap onto the bipartisan bandwagon.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Some might argue that this is a step in the right direction. 
        Polls consistently show that Americans dislike so-called "partisan bickering" 
        in Congress and say that they are turned off by the apparent asperity 
        of political debate. Polls also show, however, that most Americans know 
        next to nothing about the way our government works. It is generally believed 
        that debates over issues that are of central importance to millions of 
        United States citizens are examples of nothing more than childish squabbling. 
        Should our elected officials in fact abandon their ideologies and principles 
        in order to create a warmer and fuzzier Washington?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly any attempt to arrive at compromise requires an agreed-upon 
        rendezvous point where the two sides can come together. In the last decade, 
        this point has usually been at a vague spot somewhere just to the right 
        of center, with Democrats (lead by the conservative Democratic Leadership 
        Council) taking on a sort of mushy moderate Republicanism in order to 
        appeal to undecided voters. Welfare reform and free trade have mutated 
        from serious points of contention to silently accepted realities. Triangulation 
        and Dick Morris-inspired attempts to lead from behind have become the 
        norm. When a Democratic president tells you that "the era of big government 
        is over" (and considers this a positive step), you know something's wrong.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The fact is that our political parties should and must be 
        different from one another. Republican democracy only works when the voters 
        are given both significant choices and accurate representation. Today, 
        many issues that are still hotly contested within the American public 
        as a whole are essentially off limits in American politics. According 
        to a recent Gallup poll, 44 percent of Americans oppose the death penalty. 
        The issue was never raised in the presidential campaign. Democrats and 
        Republicans alike stalled campaign finance reform for years. Nobody is 
        willing to talk about the kind of single-payer health care that has been 
        so successful in Canada and virtually every other industrialized nation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Segregation was propped up for decades by an unlikely bipartisan 
        alliance of states-rights Republicans and Southern Democrats, and it was 
        the Bipartisan Debate Commission that excluded Ralph Nader (who ended 
        up receiving almost three million votes in a painfully close election 
        year) from the debates. Compromises on taxes, education, and the environment 
        have yielded similar results.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of real options, people grow weary of politics. 
        Turnout declines, with the greatest drops among the less educated and 
        the less well off. "The only way to win them back," says the liberal erstwhile 
        Labor Secretary Robert Reich, "is to address their everyday problems, 
        and do so in a way that distinguishes Democrats from Republicans." Democrats 
        must be exceedingly wary when they begin to walk down the road of bipartisanship, 
        as it may in fact lead them to a surprising end. Certainly civility is 
        to be admired, but waffling on issues that involve social justice and 
        the lives of real working people should not be.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, bipartisanship, like kittens or puppy love, 
        is rather hard to criticize these days without looking decidedly mean 
        spirited. Say what you will, but I think achieving any goal requires a 
        little spine. Let us not forget that acrimony and heterodoxy are prerequisites 
        for reform. Politics is neither a game nor a publicity stunt ? it can 
        have a great impact on the lives and livings of American citizens. Any 
        cause that's important enough to give lip service to is important enough 
        to fight for. Its time to rethink bipartisanship.</p>
