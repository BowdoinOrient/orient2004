      <p align="center"><i>FOREWORD</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In this essay, there are a number of attempts to describe 
        Wilderness from many angles. However, in no way is there a statement that 
        can be said to describe anything beyond what I perceive as wilderness. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I say this merely as people who read the essay might believe 
        that it was attempting to define Wilderness and not succeeding. </p>
      <p align="center"><i>A VIEW ON "WILDERNESS"</i></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1964, the American government deemed it pertinent to 
        define the woods. They attempted to draw a line. This tree would be "wilderness"; 
        another would not. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In defining and thus separating "wilderness" from the rest, 
        they protected the natural beauty that still exists. Yet that is only 
        one point of view. Another one would be that this act forced people off 
        their land. And does making certain land protected "wilderness" leave 
        the rest as victim to human environmental degradation? So what to say 
        of this controversial definition of America's lands? Can we ever come 
        to a conclusion of what a "wilderness" is? Can I give you the answer?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Not a chance. But I can tell you my thoughts. What I believe 
        a "wilderness" is and should be. I can share the beliefs of others. The 
        most important aspect of this wild ordeal is information. Being informed 
        is vital to the understanding of this issue. But that is just a building 
        block.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A start is the reason I write this. Not because I have the 
        definitive solution. But instead because in order to create that solution, 
        we must start with a basic knowledge of "wilderness." One that grows strong 
        with many a root at its base, each lending its own view. Then with that, 
        with that confused and seemingly unrelated myriad of ideas, we can move 
        on to compiling our own thoughts on "wilderness," how to preserve it, 
        how to think about it, how and if to manage it, and how to define it.</p>
      <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The real reason it is necessary to define wilderness is 
        because not enough people have respected it. In society there are two 
        kinds of people. "Dumpers" and "Huggers."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wilderness" is degraded and polluted daily by the average 
        Joe and huge Corporation X. It has become a part of many people's lifestyles 
        to care not about what does not affect them. Whether it is throwing a 
        candy wrapper in the woods or dumping toxins into a lake, it seems that 
        as long as it falls outside of their domain, it is okay. These are the 
        "dumpers." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Note that I reserve from including all in this foul de-purifying 
        process. There are some that don't harm the wilderness. They interact 
        with it, living and taking in a healthy cycle that is beneficial to all. 
        Others just respect it and do all they can to keep it pristine. I consider 
        all of the people who deal with the "wilderness" in such a manner to be 
        Natives. Whether they are actual Native Americans who live off the land, 
        always having taken as they need and no more, or they are just the avid 
        hiker who takes a little extra trash out-thus having the mindset of "home 
        equals forest and forest equals home" as the Native Americans do-both 
        groups are lovers of the land who protect it, cherish it, and understand 
        it. That is what we must strive to be: "huggers." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wilderness" can be a forest for one and a backyard for another. 
        One's beliefs on "wilderness" are shaped through life experiences. As 
        this is the case, different people perceive "wilderness" differently. 
        Whereas a city boy may consider an artificial park a "wilderness," another 
        could see it as just a landfill. Or in some cases, such as mine, at an 
        earlier age, prior to my exposure to larger and more tangible "wildernesses," 
        I believed an artificial park such as Central Park to be as natural and 
        wild as it got. Now as a person who has been lucky enough to see some 
        of the world's amazing forests, I see Central Park as little more than 
        a dirty, glassy, artificial landfill. The problem with "wilderness" is 
        that one cannot define it for anyone but oneself.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wilderness" is one of society's many collages. Everyone 
        would change and add a little something. Some regard "wilderness" as a 
        place without intention that is governed by instincts, others see it as 
        a place that is ruled by the natural elements, spontaneity, and lack of 
        control, and still others see "wilderness" as their home. The views are 
        endless. Another is that "wilderness" is an interpersonal place or a place 
        where the path ends and the unknown begins. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This discrepancy that exists in the defining of "wilderness" 
        can be supported with countless examples, all of which provide different 
        sides of this issue and, thus, are crucial to its understanding. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Wilderness" is a social construct for us. It is "environmental 
        planning," which again is an absurd concept crafted to benefit the human 
        race. All of the land taken into account is decided upon its instrumental 
        value to us. We only consider the history of the people that lived there. 
        "It's historic," we'll say. Yes, quite right, it is. The land had been 
        there for millions of years, then we show up after our drastically short 
        existences and decide that it is or is not historic. In terms of defining 
        "wilderness," the history of the land means nothing as we define the land 
        in such a way that, no matter what, it benefits us. Another distortion 
        of the reasons that we protect the land is for 'human solitude'. Great. 
        Human solitude. Has anybody thought about "land solitude"? Maybe we should 
        rethink our priorities. Perhaps it is time to address the root of the 
        problem: us. We need to think less about managing "our"-even though they 
        really are not "ours"-resources and more about managing ourselves. It 
        is not "wilderness management"; it is people management. We should not 
        preserve land for human enjoyment and use-we should preserve land to preserve 
        land. We should preserve it because we should have never interfered with 
        it in the first place.</p>
