      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; President Bush will hopefully receive enough votes from 
        congressional Democrats so that he can give the American people some much 
        needed tax relief. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For the last eight years, Americans have been overtaxed, 
        to the point that taxes are currently the highest they have been since 
        World War II. So, now, in a time of peace and constantly increasing budget 
        surpluses, it is time to give some money back to the people who afford 
        the bills.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Many Democrats are openly against Bush's $1.6 trillion tax 
        cut. Some of the reasons they cite for opposing it are: its sheer size, 
        its tendency to benefit the rich, and the potential economic risk of entrusting 
        people with their own money. These arguments are the same ones that Democrats 
        have been making to scare voters for years. And they do make for good 
        talking points; they are an effective way to throw a cheap shot at a newly 
        elected president by insinuating that he is a rich oilman who is sympathetic 
        to big businesses. But that's about all they're good for. Americans need 
        a tax cut-and we will get one. The only question now is, how big will 
        it be?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On a mere basis of size, the Bush tax-cut proposal pales 
        in comparison to the two larger tax-cut packages of the past half-century, 
        which were passed under the Kennedy and Reagan Administrations. Furthermore, 
        with budget surplus projections on the rise and warning signs being expressed 
        by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, the economic feasibility and necessity 
        of a tax cut has gained instant credibility.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As for the charge that a Bush-size tax cut would only benefit 
        the rich, the Democrats actually have a legitimate case on this one. As 
        they correctly proclaim on a regular basis, the Bush tax cut would, in 
        fact, be more favorable to the top one percent of the population than 
        to the remaining 99 percent. Still, in order to reform tax-code laws so 
        that everyone is treated more fairly, as Mr. Bush is attempting to do, 
        it is necessary to delegate a large portion of the tax cut to the people 
        who pay the bulk of taxes-that is, the wealthy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Democrats would argue against the merit of helping out 
        the wealthier members of our society while there are still poverty-stricken 
        families out there that the economic boom of the last eight years has 
        not yet reached. And, if they could have their way, wealth in this country 
        would be redistributed, so as to start everyone on a level playing field. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of redistributing wealth is a noble idea that has 
        been around since our country's founding. Yet it has never amassed much 
        support because of its anti-American nature: In the United States, we 
        are encouraged to develop our own hopes and aspirations and dreams. Many 
        of us work hard and see these dreams come to fruition; some of us don't. 
        But, no matter what the outcome is, it is not fair to punish someone simply 
        for his or her success.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, there is the claim that Bush's tax cut is economically 
        "risky." Democrats would like us to believe that somehow the government 
        knows how to spend our money more effectively than we do, and that to 
        squander the surplus on a large tax cut would bring our economy back to 
        the 1980s and the days of resounding budget deficits. They also feel that 
        the surplus should be used to fix a broken Social Security system and 
        to help pay for a prescription drug program for seniors before we start 
        messing around with a huge, reckless tax cut. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The truth is, however, that Bush's tax cut amounts to roughly 
        one-twentieth of the budget over the next ten years. With an annual budget 
        of around $3 trillion, I think the government can afford to set aside 
        $1.6 trillion out of an estimated ten-year budget of $30 trillion and 
        give it to the many hardworking Americans who pay taxes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Bush's tax-cut initiatives seem to be gaining traction and 
        receiving praise from both sides of the aisle. Of course, the hard-line 
        Democrats are furious about what they refer to as a tax cut for the wealthy. 
        But it seems, nevertheless, that Bush is gathering respectable support 
        in Congress for his tax cut. And a vote that at first seemed to favor 
        the Democrats is now too close to call. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; President Clinton has created a robust economy that many 
        have benefited from, including someone he did not intend to assist-President 
        Bush. For it seems that, in an era where unemployment is at an all time 
        low and more and more people are entering the private sector, as well 
        as investing their money in a healthy stock market, people have become 
        increasingly economically independent. So, now, when Bush advocates a 
        universal tax cut, people don't see it as a "risky scheme" like they did 
        after his father broke his pledge to cut taxes in 1988; they see another 
        way in which to attain further independence from a government that they 
        already do not trust.</p>
