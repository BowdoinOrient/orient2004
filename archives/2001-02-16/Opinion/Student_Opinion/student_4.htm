      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past few weeks, your lazy-as-sin correspondent 
        has been trying to find ways to procrastinate. I spent most of tonight 
        on Rhode Island's Department of Education website looking for a job, as 
        I spent most of last night sending letters to schools in Massachusetts. 
        (I figure if I research one state per night, it will only take me two 
        weeks to go completely insane.) In any case, searching for a job can be 
        tiring, so I need to make sure that I have enough procrastination devices 
        at hand; my all-time favorite, for three years running, has been America 
        Online's Instant Messenger service.<br>
        &nbsp; To be sure, my "Buddy List" is not as full as the Buddy Lists of 
        your typical computer-addicted adolescent. Currently, only six of my 17 
        "Mates" are online, including one of the people who bought my old house, 
        a kid from Virginia who I taught when he was in elementary school, my 
        friend Julie from Fairlawn, a family friend, and a friend of a family 
        friend. Some Buddy Lists, I've read, number into the hundreds-but do I 
        really have that many friends? Probably not.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; All of you who have used Instant Messenger know the drill: 
        your "Buddy" signs on, and, with an all-too-simple click of the mouse, 
        you can start a chat session. The problem, of course, begins when chat 
        sessions interrupt more academic pursuits (such as writing papers or checking 
        e-mail), or when chat sessions interrupt other chat sessions. And, as 
        more of your friends sign on (as did my friend Mike from Pensacola, for 
        example), you start more and more conversations. It's a vicious cycle, 
        really.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I wish that I could rationalize my use of Instant Messenger, 
        I really do. I wish that I could identify something vaguely academic about 
        it. I suppose it is helpful for me to understand acronyms like "BRB," 
        "LOL," and "j/k," if only so I can understand the next obscure Nicholson 
        Baker piece in The New Yorker in which he employs such acronyms. And it's 
        certainly helpful for me to learn to type really, really fast, so that 
        when my career as an English teacher falls through, I can become a court 
        stenographer. But, aside from its limited uses, what, really, is Instant 
        Messenger teaching me? Nothing. Therefore, I can only really rationalize 
        it as a tool by which to leave other work behind.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure that most of you would agree that, for the most 
        part, procrastination is a healthy thing, and I'm sure that you all have 
        your own devices with which to procrastinate. Perhaps you listen to music 
        (I'm currently listening to Annie Powell's copy of "Tunnel of Love," which 
        I've had since freshman year), take a trip to the Union, or go next door 
        to chat with your hallmates. Perhaps, like many Bowdoin students, you 
        use valuable work time to catch up on your e-mailing or surfing the Internet. 
        Of course, I hope that you've got your own copy of AOL Instant Messenger, 
        and that you spend as many hours as possible on it. Your grades might 
        suffer, and your social life might suffer, but at least you're practicing 
        the important life-skill of leaving stuff until the last minute. (If you 
        would like to aid in my own procrastination efforts, by the way, my screenname 
        is "Plan4Nigel." I welcome your Instant Messages anytime.)</p>
