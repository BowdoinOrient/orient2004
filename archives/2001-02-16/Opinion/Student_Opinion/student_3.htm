      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" --> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been meaning to write an article for the Orient for 
        quite some time, but honestly, it's been tough to think of a topic. To 
        get something in here, it seems you must take a concrete stance on some 
        "issue" of "great importance" that either upsets or interests you (usually 
        the former). However, I don't own a car, and I don't think President Edwards 
        is a dummy. So, here goes: hippies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it's Erykah Badu or Dave Matthews Band, every concert 
        is crawling with them. "Hey Salsich, maybe this article is better suited 
        for the Disorient," you may be saying to yourself as you decide whether 
        to get more candied beets or just to dump cheese sauce on your fries. 
        Well, I realize this may not please everyone, and I know there will be 
        someone who is deeply offended by the cultural, socioeconomic, and/or 
        political implications of this piece and will thus write a five-page letter 
        to the editor outlining said argument. Well, that's alright with me. Now, 
        back to the hippies.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;This past Thursday evening, I enjoyed taking in Ben Harper 
        and the Innocent Criminals up at that school in Lewiston. The crowd was 
        a nice cross-section ages, races, and creeds, as well as some hippies. 
        In great anticipation, I tried to get as close to the action as possible 
        before ole Ben and his boys hopped on stage. As I was wading my way through 
        the crowd, I came to a stop to determine my next move. Having stood there 
        for about 15 seconds, a young lady wearing a long dress and a disaffected 
        look queried: "Are you gonna move, or are you just gonna, like, stand 
        there the whole time?" Being somewhat taken aback at her rude and insistent 
        tone, I muttered, "Uh…I'm trying to get ahead I guess." As I pushed on 
        through, she guffawed at my obvious deficiency in concert etiquette and 
        proceeded to make out with her 45-year-old male companion. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to take my dumbfounded response back and instead 
        say, "Get a job, hippie," or, "go eat some more mushrooms, ya bum." I 
        am not one to judge someone's character by his or her outward appearance, 
        but this act of intellectual scorn struck me as odd. I was just trying 
        to do my thing and get closer to one of my favorite bands, which I believe 
        was her intent as well. Assuming (and yes, I know what happens with this 
        word) that this was not her first concert, and that she could be characterized 
        as a hippie, isn't her pretentious attitude toward a fellow-fan somewhat 
        contradictory? If she really thought that by standing there my intent 
        was to block her view, then something inside me makes me want to puke 
        at the thought of being associated with this woman. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I came across another such instance of cultural assault at 
        the Up 'Til Dawn fundraiser this past Saturday evening. For reasons unbeknownst 
        to me, I was not in a dancing mood, so I took the fly-on-the-wall approach. 
        The crowd was a sea of flailing hair and arms and I quickly realized that 
        joining such a ritual could be hazardous to my health (not to mention 
        my sense of smell). Feeling a bit out-of-place, I stepped into the restroom 
        to splash some water on my face and powder my nose. As I walked in, a 
        glassy-eyed young lad inquired: "Hey, man…are you…in line for the bathroom?" 
        Thinking him a clever whip, I answered in the affirmative, all the while 
        wondering what profound drivel would spew from his mouth next. "So are 
        we, man! That's why there's like five of us going in here!" As his voice 
        trailed off, he and his four friends, two of them females, sauntered into 
        the handicapped stall. "Intriguing," you might be saying to yourself as 
        you ponder the potential effects of Bush's ingenious new tax plan. Well, 
        it seems to be another example of the "I'm cool and you're square" attitude 
        that prevails among these whippersnappers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In both instances, I felt belittled for no apparent reason. 
        I haven't been crying myself to sleep, but it seems that the culture of 
        the hippie as it exists today is completely bogus. While there is much 
        wrong with the United States and the rest of the world, there is not a 
        convincing amount of active protest and rebellion on the part of my generation. 
        However, this "neo-hippie" phenomenon is quite visible. A sub-culture 
        that was built on the value of individuality has become another B.S. philosophy 
        or politic to which young people can easily subscribe. Of course, maybe 
        being a hippie was a way of following the crowd in the 1960s as well. 
        A wise dude once proclaimed that he chose "the road less traveled." Well, 
        Hank, everyone seems to be choosing that one nowadays. I suppose the challenge 
        on the table is to make your own road. I'm not trying to belittle anyone, 
        I just think it's funny. </p>
