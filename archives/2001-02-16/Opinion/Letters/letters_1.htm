      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not my weekly routine to write a letter to the Orient, 
        but the flyers that have been put up recently around the campus, seeking 
        awareness for Asian students, have prompted me to share my thoughts. One 
        of the many reasons why my life at Bowdoin has the potential to become 
        the 'best four years' of my life is that I am not conscious of the fact 
        that I am an international student. Even though I am involved in the International 
        Club, I am rarely conscious of the fact that my home country is Japan. 
        A big deciding factor that made me come to Bowdoin was the fact that there 
        were very few Japanese students enrolled here. The reason for this choice 
        lies in my secondary school experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For seven years before I came here, I attended an international 
        school in Germany. There were many Japanese students enrolled at the school, 
        and in my class alone, there were seven students from Japan. There was 
        a tendency for Japanese students to form an isolated group that prevented 
        interaction between the Japanese students and the other students-and we 
        received a lot of attention. I became self-conscious about my nationality 
        and was uncomfortable in this situation. As Bowdoin had few Japanese students, 
        I thought I would not face the same problem, and I believe I made the 
        right choice to come here.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The recent call for diversity and attention to races, however, 
        does alarm me. Diversity at the level of individuals is great. I am very 
        supportive of diversifying the student body with students from different 
        backgrounds and unique experiences. However, when one starts to define 
        diversity as differences in race, we are unconsciously seeding a source 
        of racism. The mere action of categorizing by races brings the awareness 
        of difference and prejudice. In the same way, calling attention to different 
        races is a source of prejudice. As far as I know, there is no obvious 
        unequal treatment of minorities on campus. What is then the need for extra 
        attention? Instead of focusing on racial differences, we should cherish 
        and recognize uniqueness of every individual and the individual's unique 
        background. As Bowdoin places emphasis on diversifying the student body, 
        I hope that diversification does not become purely a matter of diversifying 
        racial differences.</p>
