      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Honors projects should be serious endeavors; but they should 
        not be albatrosses, which is precisely what they have become in recent 
        years. Those who decide to carry through with their projects, not dropping 
        them or downgrading them into independent studies, often find themselves 
        plagued by self-loathing and regret by the end of the process. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While the evaluation process is not wholly to blame for the 
        apocalyptic character the projects tend to assume, the triple-tiered evaluation 
        scheme does little to mitigate the most unpleasant elements of the project. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the majority of departments offer honors, high 
        honors, and highest honors, while others simply do or do not award honors. 
        Distinguishing three levels of honors lends greater influence to professorial 
        bias, promotes unreasonable standards, and increases politicking and one-upmanship 
        by honors candidates. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Though regrettable, bias undeniably figures into the process 
        of evaluation. On a personal level, faculty members might be unconsciously 
        predisposed to favor a certain student for highest honors especially if 
        they have worked closely with the student over the course of a year. Other 
        biases, such as a preference for one student's subject or methodology 
        over another are likely to creep into the evaluation process, despite 
        the best attempts by professors to maintain objectivity. The honors-no 
        honors system, since it does not focus on such fine distinctions-like 
        that between high and highest honors, for example- does not allow personal 
        bias the influence it wields in the triple-tiered system.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There is a certain absurdity to the category of "highest 
        honors". To make such a distinction meaningful, it must be almost unattainable. 
        This encourages departments to offer standards like "publishable" as the 
        measure of highest honors. Not only is such a standard criminally subjective, 
        an invitation to ceaseless hairsplitting and haggling, it is also an impossible 
        criterion. What awkward length, academically immature undergraduate honors 
        project would ever be "publishable". <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Most disastrously, gradations of honors increase unhealthy 
        competition among students, in a forum where cooperation and solidarity 
        among a department's best students would do more to further students' 
        intellectual development. And at the end of the process, when honors are 
        finally awarded, the student who earns honors, or even high honors, is 
        likely to feel disappointed, jealous of a higher achieving peer, and perhaps 
        suspicious of the evaluation process. The simple camaraderie and satisfaction 
        of completion evaporates, and for few identifiable benefits. Shouldn't 
        we encourage and reward students who demonstrate extra academic ambition, 
        not flog them for the sin of intellectual curiosity? </p>
