      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During this week's discussion forum, students tried to develop 
        ideas for improving the College House System. While such efforts are commendable, 
        it is unlikely that the House System will improve unless action is taken 
        regarding the place of alcohol in Bowdoin's social structure. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While hard alcohol and "drinking games" are not allowed on 
        campus, each weekend, the College-funded Houses host parties which provide 
        kegs of beer to students. Yet the vast majority of party attendees are 
        First-years and sophomores who are not of legal drinking age. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; House parties are heavily marketed towards under-class students 
        since they have limited alternatives for drinking-few of them are 21 and 
        are thus excluded from Brunswick's hopping bar scene and find it difficult 
        to otherwise procure alcohol. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The upper-class students who have viable entertainment alternatives 
        often choose activities other than the College House parties. Perhaps 
        the most obvious reason for this phenomenon is that House parties offer 
        those over the age of 21 a poor value; the parties offer free, albeit 
        low-quality beer, and little else. Why should anyone attend an event that 
        begins at 10:00 p.m. and ends at midnight when they could instead spend 
        an entire evening with friends? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this flaw, many upper-class students feel 
        daunted by the House System since so few of their classmates attend these 
        parties. The only solution to this problem is to make social events more 
        palatable to those over 21, rather than host parties that are essentially 
        meat markets centered on a finite quantity of cheap keg beer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While changes to the House System will not be easy, they 
        are necessary to provide, as stated in the Student Handbook's section 
        on drugs and alcohol, "an environment in which students can further their 
        own intellectual, social, moral, and physical development and in which 
        all members of the campus community can work together in pursuit of knowledge 
        and understanding." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We wish the leaders of the House System luck in this quest, 
        both for the selfish reason of improving social life now, and for the 
        more grandiose goal of improving the inter-class dialogue and creating 
        a more unified and vibrant Bowdoin.</p>
