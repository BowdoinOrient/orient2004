      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students returned to campus after a relaxing winter 
        break, it was anything but relaxing between Facilities Services and some 
        students on the Residential Life staff. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ann Goodenow, assistant director for Facilities Services, 
        proposed a plan over winter break that would rotate the housekeepers on 
        an annual basis between the residential buildings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan was scheduled to take effect sometime in late 
        January, but student members of the Residential Life staff authored a 
        petition to encourage Goodenow to wait until the end of the academic year 
        to implement the program. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, along with the concerns expressed by a number 
        of the housekeepers, helped postpone the change until summer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The housekeeping rotation plan proposed by Goodenow 
        and her staff is an extension of a plan that Facilities Services has already 
        used with the second shift of housekeepers that clean the academic buildings 
        after hours.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way it works, for example, is that the housekeeper 
        who cleans Sills Hall, the most utilized classroom building on campus, 
        rotates to another building next year, perhaps Massachusetts Hall, where 
        the task of cleaning the building might not be as demanding.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without such a rotation system, whoever worked in Sills 
        Hall would remain there with no timeframe of when, if ever, he or she 
        would have the option of switching to another, less-demanding building.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housekeepers working in the residential buildings, 
        though, do not follow this system.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the housekeepers are divided on the issue of 
        rotating annually. Goodenow estimated that probably two-thirds of the 
        housekeepers believe it's time to move ahead and make this plan a reality.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vivian Asbra, a housekeeper in Chamberlain Hall, said 
        with a big smile, &quot;I embrace change!&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she did say that she was pleased that the swtich 
        was going to be taking place at the end of the school year rather than 
        mid-semester.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the other housekeeprs had similar responses. 
        Joyce Mayer of Howard Hall said that she didn't mind the change and was 
        looking forward to being able to meet some of the other students on campus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would want to stay [in Howard] if I had a choice, 
        but it would be nice to change.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though many of the housekeepers are not excited 
        about the change, they realize that it is a reality that will come true 
        in June.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Martin, Maine Hall's housekeeper, has been cleaning 
        his dorm for the past severn years, but he said he realizes it's better 
        to accept it than to grumble about the new plan.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, many other housekeepers said that they are 
        not at all happy with the plan.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howell's housekeeper, Elaine Desrosiers, said that she 
        loves working in her building and does not want to leave it at the end 
        of the year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student memebers of the Residential Life staff picked 
        up the trail when word spread that the housekeeprs were scheduled to begin 
        the rotation process early this year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A petition was filed directly to Ann Goodenow of Facilities 
        on January 31, 2001 outlining the reasons the rotation program should 
        at least be put off until the end of the academic year when students will 
        be away from campus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle complaint stated in the petition was that 
        &quot;[the changes] significantly disrupt the important relationships 
        that have been established between the dormitory residents and the housekeepers. 
        . .<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;While a 'higher level of cleanliness' may rightly 
        be the primary concern for your department, our primary concern as residents 
        is that we know the individuals who care for the buildings that constitute 
        our second homes.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition also mentioned the bond formed between 
        residents and housekeepers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Many of us have developed long-term friendships 
        with our housekeepers. These friendships not only guarantee that the dormitories 
        are welcoming places to live, they also ensure. . . [that we] are respectful 
        of the housekeepers and their hard work.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodenow said she agreed that the decision to implement 
        the housekeeper plan so early in the semester may have been seen as impulsive.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At the time, we didn't want to wait. In hindsight, 
        we did not ask our customers, the students, to find out their concerns,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Goodenow said she feels confident that the 
        new system is the right way to not only increase the efficiency of housekeepers, 
        but also to spread her team around the campus so that students can form 
        friendships with more of her staff. Goodenow said that she hoped that, 
        in time, more people will embrace the change.<br>
