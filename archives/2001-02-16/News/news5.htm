      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Bowdoin alumnus Toby Lenk '83 announced 
        his plans to close eToys, a highly-publicized online retail venture, and 
        lay off his remaining 293 employers on April 6. According to USA Today 
        writer Bruce Horowitz, "In just one year, eToys went from being a perceived 
        threat to retailing giant Toys 'R' Us to just another e-commerce casualty." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many economists are blaming the failure of eToys on 
        poor customer service and expensive advertising campaigns, both of which 
        resulted in eToys not being able to adequately meet the needs of its customers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marketing tactics are what helped make eToys strong. 
        It became a household name for its unique, yet very pricey, print advertisements 
        and commercials, which appealed to both parents and children.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eToys was launched in June 1997, originally with the 
        sole purpose of selling educational toys. However, founder and CEO Lenk 
        expanded the operation, with the goal of rivaling such established corporations 
        as Toys 'R' Us as the prime retail market for toys and children's goods. 
        The site was highly anticipated by many marketers and economists, believing 
        that such an expansive venture could be daring enough to work.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, during the 1999 holiday season, eToys was accused 
        of falling short of one of its initial goals-speedy and reliable customer 
        service. Thousands of customers complained that their orders were either 
        late in arriving at their destination or contained the wrong merchandise. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eToys suffered another blow in 2000 when Amazon.com 
        agreed to team up with Toys 'R' Us to create an even more expansive online 
        toy retailer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disappointing 2000 holiday sales, in which the company 
        fell short of its goal of earning $212 million, forced the company to 
        lay off 700 employees in early January and shut down all but one of its 
        warehouses. On February 5, Lenk announced that his company was filing 
        for bankruptcy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenk graduated summa cum laude from the College in 1983. 
        After working in Washington, D.C., he attended Harvard Business School, 
        where he earned his MBA. He then entered the consulting business before 
        accepting a job with Disney in 1991. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, he left Disney to cultivate eToys. Lenz spoke 
        at Common Hour in April 2000. </p>
