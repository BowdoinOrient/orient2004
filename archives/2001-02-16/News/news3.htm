      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly but quickly, Bowdoin is making significant 
        changes to information technologies on campus, including preparations 
        for wireless internet access in classroom buildings and the libraries, 
        assistance for faculty in creating course-specific web pages, and improvements 
        to troubleshooting services available to students and faculty.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most immediate and visible change is the introduction 
        of wireless Internet access in an Adams computer lab. Director of Computing 
        and Information Services Robert Mayer explained that Apple Computer's 
        Airport technology is "just starting to show up on college campuses." 
        The technology, which allows computers to wirelessly connect to the Internet 
        much like cellular phones, may soon be put to use in other classroom buildings, 
        Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, and possibly Hatch Science Library. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the Airport is for students and faculty 
        to be able to access the Internet in and around these buildings without 
        having to physically plug their computers into a wall. Mayer commented 
        that it would be possible to cover the entire quad with an Airport network; 
        "Would students be interested in sitting on the quad and doing work on 
        the Internet?" he asked.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayer also noted that President Mills's house would 
        be made wireless Internet-ready, and that Mills is interested in learning 
        about technology at Bowdoin. "He prefers email for communication," Mayer 
        observed, "as opposed to the current president."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, students will soon be able to access the 
        Internet wirelessly in the classroom, professors may soon want to put 
        a significant amount of course material online. The Educational Technology 
        Center (ETC),<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, students will soon be able to access the 
        Internet wirelessly in the classroom, professors may soon want to put 
        a significant amount of course material online. The Educational Technology 
        Center (ETC), anticipating that need, has devoted a staff member to assisting 
        faculty in creating web pages for their classes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ETC director Peter Schilling said that last year's $27 
        million gift from Stanley Druckenmiller, earmarked for technology, allowed 
        the ETC to focus on putting course material online. "Unlike most institutions," 
        Schilling said, "Bowdoin supports the faculty directly" in technological 
        endeavors.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schilling also detailed a recent $600,000 grant from 
        the U.S. Department of Education for the biology department to study the 
        effectiveness of different teaching methods, including methods that incorporate 
        new information technologies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If students or faculty are unsure just how to deal with 
        all these new gizmos on campus, CIS has a solution for that, too. Mayer 
        said he understands the dilemma facing students who are expected to be 
        familiar with computer technology, "yet there's no opportunity to learn 
        it." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIS recently began offering online training for faculty, 
        staff, and students in common computer applications like Excel, QuarkXpress, 
        and PowerPoint. Mayer said that the classes are targeted towards faculty 
        and staff, but that many students have expressed interest in the seminars.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, CIS is in the process of improving its 
        technical support; new software will coordinate calls to REACH (x5050) 
        and the CIS helpdesk (x3030) in an effort to field calls more efficiently-even 
        calls like this: "Can I really sit on the quad and download stuff from 
        Napster? Cool." </p>
