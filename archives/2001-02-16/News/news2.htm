      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words "choice" and "autonomy" were the key terms 
        at a student discussion forum on the College House System held Tuesday. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 35 students gathered to participate in 
        the Student Government-sponsored forum to which administrators were not 
        invited. The intent of the forum was to discuss possible improvements 
        to the house system, which Student Congress could present to the Administration.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owen Strachan '03, a member of the Student Executive 
        Board, opened the discussion by saying that the forum was not intended 
        to be a "bashing session," nor to "praise Res Life for the wonderful job 
        they've done."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the forum focused on two problems that many 
        students saw as particularly important. The first was the lack of choice 
        in entering the house system, and the second was the lack of autonomy 
        of individual houses.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many students said that automatically assigning students 
        to a house, without giving them any choice, resulted in a lack of ownership 
        that most students feel toward their house affiliation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other students said they felt that the sheer number 
        of students who are affiliated with each house is a problem. They said 
        that it is difficult for students to feel bonded to the approximately 
        300 affiliates with whom they otherwise have no connection.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many students said they felt that the houses 
        were often no more than a place for students to party-not a place where 
        affiliates particularly belong. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One student said that affiliates have access to the 
        house and the house's events, but they really have no responsibility toward 
        it, which once again detracts from their sense of ownership.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other students voiced the need for more house autonomy 
        and less Residential Life control. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One student said, "I think the biggest issue that needs 
        to be addressed is that there's too much Res Life control." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students said they felt that the houses needed more 
        character and that this was difficult to accomplish under the strict supervision 
        of the College, especially Residential Life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some students also identified problems with becoming 
        an actual house resident. Some students said that people apply to live 
        in the houses for the wrong reasons, which often involve the possibility 
        of otherwise suffering an unfortunate fate in the housing lottery and 
        not being able to live with friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, another student who was a member of the committee 
        that put together the current house resident selection process said, "I 
        think that the process is good, and what we need is more people interested 
        in applying."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other students brought up issues regarding living in 
        the houses. They said they feel that the houses lack individuality and 
        that each house "just seems like another dorm, not a house." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students also said that they don't feel as if the houses 
        are theirs to decorate; they just pay for the damages and turn the houses 
        over to someone else the next year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern that students expressed was the lack 
        of diversity in the houses. One student said, "The lack of diversity in 
        the houses is a big problem." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that houses cater to an homogenous group which 
        leaves many students feeling excluded.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students also offered possible solutions to the problems. 
        The most loudly voiced opinion was that students should be allowed to 
        choose whether or not they join the house system, and not be simply forced. 
        It was also recommended that students should be allowed to choose which 
        house they wanted to join if they do decide to participate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible method of implementing such a solution 
        would be by sponsoring a "rush week" or day in which students would be 
        invited to house activities and allowed to select a house affiliation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to welcome first-year students was especially 
        emphasized, because part of building a house's individual character is 
        establishing a legacy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other students, though, also mentioned the importance 
        of including upperclass students, as well. One suggestion was for the 
        houses to sponsor more upperclass-only events so that those students would 
        not be deterred from affiliating with the house due to the number of events 
        that are geared primarily toward first years.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although no one could provide a solution to the rather 
        large number of affiliates associated with each house, it was mentioned 
        that the College hopes to add two more houses, with corresponding first-year 
        dorms, eventually.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One student expressed his opinion of the house system 
        by saying, "I think it's failing as a system." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that not enough people are applying to live 
        in the houses, and affiliates aren't involved.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another student said, "I don't think the houses are 
        going to work for everyone, and that's okay." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One student concluded by saying that there have been 
        years and years of talk regarding the house system, but nothing has been 
        done. He said that if people don't want to do anything, then maybe there 
        shouldn't even be a house system. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although few students at the forum were familiar with 
        the fraternity system, one student did mention that the College Houses 
        are more active in the community than the fraternity houses were. Another 
        student said that the purpose of instituting the house system was to shoot 
        for a system similar to fraternities but without the exclusivity.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, few students remembered the Alpha Delta Phi 
        dinners to which students from all segments of the Bowdoin community were 
        invited and welcomed. </p>
