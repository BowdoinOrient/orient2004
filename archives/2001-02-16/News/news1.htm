      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honors projects for seniors have typically involved 
        a vast amount of research, the formation of a thesis or hypothesis, and 
        then a lengthy paper or experiment on a specific topic. However, the system 
        of awarding honors to these independent projects can involve either one 
        or three tiers of honors, depending on the department. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, each department awarded honors, high 
        honors, and highest honors, but some departments, including chemistry, 
        biology, and art history, have diverged, feeling that only one level of 
        honors is appropriate. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the Bowdoin community have said that 
        they believe it would be beneficial to institute a unified system for 
        evaluating honors projects, where each department would issue the same 
        level of honors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig McEwen, Dean for Academic Affairs, came from the 
        sociology department, which went from three levels to one level of honors, 
        and is the chair of a committee supporting the one tier system. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McEwen noted that "grading honors theses isn't like 
        grading an exam. It's a threshold decision about whether independent work 
        deserves honors." He also mentioned the difficulty in evaluating the different 
        types of projects: "It's hard to differ among students fairly when many 
        outside factors enter into the final quality and character of the project." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian Linton, assistant professor of chemistry, also 
        said he felt it was unnecessary to make distinctions between levels of 
        honors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do not see the need to demarcate those who moderately 
        excelled from those who really excelled from those who were complete masters 
        of their domain….A hierarchy of honors is unnecessary and may tend to 
        marginalize those who only receive the lowest level," he said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others see the proposed uniformity as an affront to 
        departmental independence. David Page, the Charles Weston Pickard professor 
        of chemistry, said, "Corporate uniformity works well for places like McDonalds 
        and Wal-Mart but is counter-productive in a first tier small liberal arts 
        college like Bowdoin." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supporters of the three-tiered system also cite the 
        fundamental differences between honors projects in different departments 
        as reasons to allow each department to issue its own standards for projects. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Page also said, "Which approach to awarding honors is 
        taken depends on the requirements of the discipline. An honors project 
        in history is conducted in a very different way from one in an experimental 
        discipline like biology, chemistry, or biochemistry." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some students feel the discrepancy in honors 
        distribution between departments is not necessarily fair, as they are 
        limited in the amount of honors attained by the their field of study. 
        For example, one student in the chemistry department can only receive 
        honors, while his or her peer in the history department may get highest 
        honors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron Rosen '01 said, "Universally adopting the single-standard 
        system doesn't mean foregoing academic rigor; it just means reducing some 
        of the inconsistency and politics of the process."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision will be reached in March with a faculty 
        vote to determine if the system should be uniform across departments, 
        and if so, with how many degrees of honors. </p>
