      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summer semester and my year at Bowdoin (I didn't 
        know yet there was going to be a second one) were rapidly drawing to a 
        close. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Beginning to feel a bit mellow?" one of my friends 
        asked. I certainly was. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there was my trip with Mrs. Applegate 
        across the continent to look forward to. Nellie was extremely pleased 
        to hear I'd passed my driving test, and of my chapel talk on the same 
        day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before setting out for California, Bill and Nancy's 
        wedding was held, with me as Best Man, at the New Wagon Inn in Boothbay 
        Harbor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seated next to the Maid of Honour, whose name I forget 
        but not her face, I had a wonderful time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before going away, Nancy threw the garter her way, but 
        it was I who caught it. Though having danced at many a wedding since, 
        I never did get married. The last one I attended was that of my sister's 
        eldest son six years ago in San Francisco. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea I would soon be seeing this fabulous place, 
        and maybe driving across the Golden Gate, filled me with excitement. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't get too excited," Nellie wryly remarked, "first 
        you've got to get us across the George Washington Bridge." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That important test passed, we spent our first night 
        of a memorable trip across the American continent at a motel on the New 
        Jersey Turnpike, in separate rooms of course, which was to be the arrangement 
        throughout. Silly really, considering I was 19, and she 77. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Having fun with your grandma?" a waitress once said. 
        Of course you wouldn't believe motel prices back in the fifties, out West 
        especially, as low as $2.50 per room or cabin, adjoining sometimes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make me feel "important," Nellie let me handle the 
        money, giving me so much a day from which to pay for our rooms, and letting 
        me keep what was left as pocket money. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I selected the cheapest I could find. Used 
        to staying in luxury hotels, she got a great kick out of this. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another milestone was crossing the Mississippi at St. 
        Louis, Gateway to the West. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here on out we followed famous Route 66, at one 
        point staying with old friends of Nell's in Tulsa, Oklahoma-someone in 
        the oil business, of course. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came the Grand Canyon, an overwhelming experience. 
        This time I was given more money so we could stay at Park Lodges, at the 
        South as well as North Rim. From the latter, we headed north through the 
        Kaibab Forest for Bryce, even more beautiful in its quite unique way. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America's answer, in wind?eroded sandstone figures said 
        by the Indians to have been people, to China's Terra Cotta Soldiers, not 
        yet discovered. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Las Vegas, not looking anything as garish as it does 
        today, Nellie couldn't resist playing one-armed bandits, with me watching 
        fascinated and wanting to have a go too. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, a uniformed guard walked up and said, "Don't 
        you think you'd better wait outside, son, while your Mom gambles?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt humiliated, but Nellie was tickled pink to be 
        taken for my mother. To remind me of this experience, for my 21st birthday 
        two years later, she gave me 21 silver dollars, all of which I foolishly 
        spent. Neither could I have voted until then, had I been an American citizen. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Vegas, we headed for Hoover Dam, another great 
        experience, and then straight across the Mojave Desert for Los Angeles, 
        our final destination. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming into LA from the San Fernando Valley on Interstate 
        Highway 405 in late afternoon, we turned off onto Sepulveda Boulevard 
        lined by palm trees throwing lengthening shadows. Through the open windows 
        of the car, an Oldsmobile 98, with air-conditioning that had broken down 
        in the desert-incredibly balmy air wafted in. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picking up Wiltshire Boulevard and heading west on it 
        toward Hollywood, we turned off at Westwood where Nellie owned property, 
        on the corner of Kinross and Glendon Avenues, with access from either 
        to the patio of a restaurant on the ground floor and a small apartment 
        for her own use above it called the Jewel Box. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built in the thirties after her divorce from a wealthy 
        Manila businessman, it fully deserved the name. I couldn't believe my 
        eyes when I saw it. An outside gallery led straight into the living room 
        with wall-to-wall fluffy white carpeting, walls paneled in cherry wood, 
        curving at one end with a hidden bar, and hung with authentic Japanese 
        watercolors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine was to be the small guest room with Chinese silk 
        tapestries, plus a tiny dressing room, so low one could touch the ceiling. 
        This had full-length mirrors into which I, a born narcissist, kept staring 
        to admire myself in a new jacket Nellie had bought me at the Westwood 
        branch of Bullock's, a well-known LA department store, not far from the 
        UCLA campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted her "German boy" to look smart, she said, 
        when dining out with her, at the Beverly Hills Hotel, for example. Wearing 
        enormous hats, huge dangling earrings, and dark glasses, half-blind Nellie 
        might have been taken for Greta Garbo. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westwood Village then was almost entirely residential, 
        with rows of neat little houses in adobe style and colorful front gardens. 
        Many of these have since been torn down to make room for a giant Medical 
        Center, quite a shock to me when sentimentally revisiting the area while 
        staying with my sister, who lives at Laguna, for my nephew's wedding. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing Nell did before even unpacking was to 
        call an old friend, Earl Boehme, a plastic surgeon, formerly at the Mayo 
        Clinic in Boston, who'd done her face-lifts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said she wanted me to meet Earl, his wife, and two 
        children, a boy of 16 called Douglas and a girl of 18 called Gretchen. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A real character, she said, "old Earl." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put my picture out, darling," he told her, "I'm coming 
        right over." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boehmes, of German or Bohemian origin, lived in 
        a large house with a swimming pool in Santa Monica. Earl's wife was called 
        Bonnie, like my sexy Ivies date. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending much of her time by the pool and on the tennis 
        courts, Bonnie's lithe limbs were permanently bronzed. Needless to say, 
        I was more taken with her than pretty but shy Gretchen, a freckle-faced 
        redhead. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a flamboyant lifestyle, Earl Boehme was a devout 
        Catholic, and later joined the hospital ship "Hope" for a year. While 
        going round the world dispensing medical aid to needy people in underdeveloped 
        nations, Dr. Boehme in the midst of his charitable work tragically died 
        of a heart attack. More of "old Earl," another Unforgettable Character, 
        next time. </p>
