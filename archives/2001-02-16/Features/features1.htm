      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation of the former Kappa Delta Theta 
        fraternity house into Bowdoin's new admissions office is nearly complete, 
        and it is a remarkable addition to our campus. No longer will prospective 
        students and their families wander around Stowe and the Tower looking 
        for a small, unsightly admissions office after searching for a parking 
        spot for 15 minutes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as they pull into the convenient visitors' parking 
        lot from Maine Street, they will see the impressive façade of the new 
        office, with its white columns, balcony, and stained glass insignia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narrow, dimly-lit waiting room of the old admissions 
        office is in stark contrast to the spacious and light-filled entrance 
        hall of the new building. The walls have been painted a beautiful deep 
        red with white accents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking in with the receptionist, visitors can 
        pick up viewbooks and course catalogues, check out current campus events 
        on several bulletin boards, or access the Internet on one of four computers 
        set up in the entrance hall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While waiting for a tour or interview to begin, visitors 
        can relax in the comfortable, lounge-like waiting room immediately off 
        to the right of the entrance hall. The air-conditioned room is complete 
        with green leather couches, upholstered chairs, window seats, and a working 
        gas fireplace. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the building, the original woodwork of the 
        windows, mantels, and window-seats has been exquisitely restored. In addition 
        to the cosmetic work that has been done, major structural changes had 
        to be made to have the building meet regulations, including adding an 
        elevator and two enclosed stairwells, and fixing the foundation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the former admissions office, with only two single 
        bathrooms available to visitors, the new office has several large, beautifully 
        tiled bathrooms on the first floor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the left of the entrance hall is a large room dedicated 
        to group information sessions. As visitors trickle in for the sessions, 
        they will notice a large, state of the art, flat-screen television on 
        the wall. The television will be continuously showing images of aspects 
        of the College not visible on the campus tour, including the Coastal Studies 
        Center and behind-the-scenes work in Pickard Theater. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group information session room can seat up to 45 
        people and opens through sliding doors onto the side porch of the building, 
        allowing an easy departure point for campus tours. Although most of the 
        rooms haven't been decorated yet, there is a valuable original Audubon 
        painting, a gift from an alumnus, gracing the wall just outside the group 
        information session room. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the prospective student is having an interview, he 
        or she will be led up the grand staircase to the second or third floor, 
        where the admissions officers have their offices. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new building is completely accessible to visitors 
        in wheelchairs, with additional interview rooms on the first floor as 
        well as access to the upper floors by elevator. The offices each have 
        large windows, affording the occupants lots of natural light and a nice 
        view of the library, Baxter House, or the front lawn. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new admissions office not only will impress prospective 
        students with its beauty and technology, but it will also improve the 
        efficiency and comfort of the admissions staff. In the old building, the 
        support staff had offices on the first floor, while the admissions officers' 
        offices were on the second floor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the admissions officers' and support staff's offices 
        are side-by-side on the second and third floors. The data entry room is 
        equipped with ergonomic desks of adjustable height, which is very important 
        because many different people use those desks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior interviewers will have their own office on the 
        third floor where they can go to write up their interviews. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new building includes plenty of storage room for 
        archived applications, with file cabinets on rollers to allow easy transportation 
        of the huge volume of paperwork that the college application process generates. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large staff conference room is in the former Theta 
        library in the basement. It has a small kitchen, fireplace, and windows, 
        making a nice homey atmosphere for where the real action takes place-the 
        critical decisions of acceptance and rejection. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ouellet Construction company, a Maine business that 
        also built Howard and Stowe, did a wonderful job preserving the architectural 
        details of the former Theta house while transforming it into a modern, 
        functional office. Richard Steele, Vice President of Admissions and Financial 
        Aid, said that his favorite thing about the new office was how it had 
        "a sense of history and the latest technology merged with it." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new office will be fully operating by the end of 
        the month. </p>
