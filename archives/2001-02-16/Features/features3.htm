      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure commonly known as the "Theta" chapter 
        house is now being renovated to serve its new purpose as the admissions 
        office. Although many similar fraternal houses purchased and renovated 
        by the College have undergone similar "updating," none saw the care and 
        sensitivity given to the Theta chapter house in this renovation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not imply that the most recent renovation 
        was the most careful or sensitive possible; for although the College has 
        invested greater effort in this project than in the hurried and sloppy 
        "college house" renovations, similar trends can be found in all such structures 
        on campus. These architectural defects should be most familiar to students.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Theta structure was built in 1901 as the Delta Kappa 
        Epsilon chapter house, to the specifications of Boston architects Chapman 
        & Frazer. Within the year, the same firm was selected to design a very 
        similar structure at 10 College Street for Mr. Hartley Cone Baxter '78. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While both buildings have faithfully served the college 
        for one hundred years, the students and the Administration of Bowdoin 
        have treated them poorly. It is heartbreaking to see the once-comfortable 
        interiors of these structures destroyed by reckless students and the party-proofing 
        administration. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally disheartening is the approach taken with "improvements," 
        such as the most recent slate of renovations. Aesthetic considerations 
        are nearly always considered only after the functionality of the buildings 
        is improved, rather than being considered integral to the functioning 
        of the building. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should emphasize that although such institutional 
        trends can be found in the new admissions building, greater care has been 
        taken to ensure that incoming students get at least a taste of what the 
        architecture of Bowdoin once was. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first floor rooms, where most prospective students 
        will become acquainted with our college and its history, have been much 
        more carefully preserved and decorated than the upper reaches of the facility. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While much of the detailing and millwork on the first 
        floor has been prudently restored and highlighted, the upper stories of 
        the building embody the institutionalizing effect wrought by the hand 
        of Bowdoin's administration. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The halls and offices are devoid of character and interest 
        of any sort. The standard just-off-white eggshell finish has been chosen 
        with the omnipresent muted gray carpet of so many boring halls and corridors 
        built in recent years. To complete the set, the institutional gray and 
        clear plastic door signs, brushed steel mechanical door latches, and acoustic 
        ceiling tiles are used. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The College is so enamored with this ensemble that it 
        seems to appear nearly everywhere creativity runs dry-which sadly is more 
        places than one would care to think. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several aspects of the project are nonetheless different 
        than the standard fare. Encouraging is the use of wood framed windows 
        for the entire building, a material that has long been absent in the renovation 
        of historic campus buildings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of the College's famed art collection will 
        be on display in the interior. Hopefully this will be accompanied by a 
        few of the suspiciously absent antiques the College owns. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also inspiring is the proper application of new and 
        not-white clapboard siding, which gives the structure its original, correct, 
        and more massive appearance. The even and symmetrical massing of the front 
        façade contrasts, however with the rear additions to the roofline and 
        façades facing Cole's Tower, giving the structure a busy and unsettling 
        appearance on that side. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also disappointing is the use of asphalt shingles on 
        the varied roof spanses. Such a colonial revival building does not deserve 
        such shoddy materials, or such a temporary appearance. In complete contrast, 
        the front balustrades and portico of the building have been reconstructed 
        in expertly joined cedar. This, as well as a handful of interior carpentry 
        applications, reflects the only substantive aesthetic improvements to 
        the building. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the new admissions office represents a significant 
        step up from the renovation of other fraternity structures, it remains 
        less than it once was. Clearly, more care, time, and resources were spent 
        planning this renovation than in those in which students actually reside. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as with all recent campus improvements, a part 
        of the character and tradition of the College has been irretrievably lost 
        to the powers of "progress." <br>
