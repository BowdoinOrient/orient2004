      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear Dr. Jeff</b>: Last year when I had a cough, 
        my physician at home gave me a "z-pack." Last week, when I went to the 
        Health Center with the same type of cough, I was told I had a "cold" and 
        didn't need an antibiotic. What's the deal? -<i>M.W.</i><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear M.W.</b>: I can't comment about your cough last 
        year, but I assume that this year you were told your illness was likely 
        viral, not bacterial. The vast majority of upper respiratory infections 
        are viral in origin, and antibiotics don't kill viruses. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnecessary antibiotics can be harmful. They can have 
        side effects (allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea, and yeast infections, 
        to name a few); they can kill off helpful bacteria (which may offer protection 
        against viral pathogens); and they can increase the development of antibiotic-resistant 
        bacteria (so that diseases that used to be easy to treat become very difficult 
        to cure). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when antibiotics are indicated, choosing the wrong 
        one, or choosing an especially broad-spectrum antibiotic, may give many 
        organisms in the body a chance to develop resistance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zithromax, prescribed in your "z-pack," is easy to take 
        and very effective for specific types of infections. Just last month it 
        was specifically targeted in Consumer Reports as a leading culprit in 
        "antibiotic misuse and overuse." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you're well aware, it's cold and flu season now. 
        Common symptoms are: runny or congested noses, sore throats, cough, headache, 
        fever, fatigue, and muscle aches. These illnesses generally need to "run 
        their course," and treatment aims to relieve symptoms: decongestants, 
        gargles, cough syrup, Tylenol or Ibuprofen, steam, extra fluids, and rest. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes these illnesses take longer than you think 
        they should to resolve. Sometimes these illnesses progress into other 
        problems, such as ear infections or bronchitis. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning signs of more likely bacterial illness include: 
        severe ear pain, fever greater than 101.5 for more than 3 days, prolonged 
        or severe sinus pain, shortness of breath, deep cough productive of green 
        or bloody phlegm, and swollen red tonsils with white spots. <br>
