      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five hundred thousand men, North and South, lay dead. 
        Some fell on the fields they had so valiantly defended or assaulted. Others 
        fell in the deep swampy bayous of the Mississippi valley, or in the thousands 
        of unsanitary and disease-ridden army hospitals, which saw the worst of 
        the War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands walked--and many were carried--home, bearing 
        the wounds of a five-year war. For years, the memories would not fade. 
        The names of the dead would be enshrined forever in the history of the 
        continent they had fought so hard to preserve for their own causes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mothers, wives, and sisters mourned. Fathers, brothers, 
        and sons grieved. The South would never be the same. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Railroad lines were cut, twisted into piles of useless 
        metal. Towns, whole cities, had been burnt to the ground. Farms, and fields, 
        once rich with the bounty of the earth lay in ruins, picked clean by the 
        hands of professional soldiers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A society had been destroyed, and a nation had been 
        reborn.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The price had been paid. But what was the result? What 
        was the great prize that the nation had paid for with all this devastation? 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was called freedom, and while it is something that 
        is taken for granted today, it was an issue that sparked controversy back 
        in the middle of the nineteenth century. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four million slaves had been liberated from bondage-and 
        some might argue, so to were the minds of many who, like us today, forgot 
        what we had to pay for and what we still have to do to ensure that the 
        freedom of man is never trampled on by the foot of tyranny. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham Lincoln had proclaimed that those enslaved in 
        the states of rebellion were "forever free," yet Lincoln, that great engineer 
        of a new republic, was dead in his grave, the victim of an assassin's 
        bullet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus the reins of power were passed to a self-made 
        Tennessean by the name of Andrew Johnson, and the task of bringing the 
        former slaves into the land of liberty was given to a Bowdoin graduate 
        named Oliver Otis Howard.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Secretary of War Edwin Stanton offered Howard the 
        position of Commissioner of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned 
        Lands (Freedmen's Bureau in short), Howard didn't know what to think. 
        He had just brought the Army of the Tennessee up from its march through 
        the Carolinas and was preparing for the Grand Review of the Union Armies. 
        Suddenly, his next assignment was handed to him, and it was one of considerable 
        importance to the future of the nation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His most pressing duties as commissioner would be to 
        set up emergency stations for the thousands of homeless and destitute 
        in the South. Rations would have to be handed out, and the homeless would 
        have to be clothed and sheltered. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when all of this was done, Howard would also have 
        to appropriate thousands of acres of lands to the freedmen as well as 
        make sure that they had the necessary tools for surviving in the new South. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This latter task included setting up a new education 
        system, fighting for civil rights in courts of law, and enforcing peace 
        between the two races. It was not an easy task, as Howard's commander 
        and friend William T. Sherman told him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman had the fullest belief in Howard's ability as 
        a commander of men in the field, but perhaps Sherman knew deep in his 
        brilliant mind that Howard was not suited for the job. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner Howard would have control of unlimited 
        resources (as stipulated by the act of Congress which created the position), 
        but he would also have to be involved in the politics of Washington, and 
        Sherman knew full well that the vicious capital was no place for the honest 
        Oliver Howard.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever Sherman's objections, Howard accepted the position, 
        and with it, the task of piecing the nation back together. He began by 
        laying down his plans. Howard knew full well that the Bureau's life was 
        limited. Congress had authorized it to run for only one year, not knowing 
        that it would take decades for the nation to truly be "reconstructed." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard thus vowed that while the Bureau would help as 
        much as it could, its primary purpose was to teach the freedmen how to 
        survive and to equip them with the tools to fight their own battles, not 
        to fight those battles for them or to provide them with everything. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tools for the freedmen, Howard could see 
        no other more essential tool than education. Thus it was in this field 
        that he invested most of his time and effort. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another essential requirement was land, and this, alongside 
        with equal rights, was what Howard was gearing up to fight for. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, however, he summoned to Washington the people 
        he hoped would help him in running the Bureau. Most of these men had served 
        with him in the Army, and others came highly recommended by others in 
        Washington. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of note were General Rufus Saxton, a preacher who, during 
        the War, commanded the Sea Islands and became famous for promoting the 
        "Port Royal Project," which had helped to establish that freedmen, once 
        freed, would indeed work and would work well. By the end of the War, the 
        community of the Sea Islands was thriving, made up of former slaves who 
        had cultivated the lands their former masters had left during the early 
        days of the War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also General J. S. Fullerton (whose first 
        name-whether it is James or Joseph-seems to be disputed by historians), 
        who was a trusted friend of Howard's but was soon to betray him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just to bring things a little closer to Bowdoin, 
        there was Colonel Eliphalet Whittlesey, a former staff member of Howard's 
        and a former professor at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also more, and Howard basically had an Assistant 
        Commissioner for every state in the former rebellion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These Assistant Commissioners would have the task of 
        hiring their own agents and actually experiencing first-hand the everyday 
        effects of their policies on the Southerners and the freedmen. This task 
        of finding competent and sympathetic men proved to be difficult due to 
        the Army's massive downsizing at the end of the War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the War had been hailed as a war to set other 
        men free, and thus a holy crusade, it was still a very liberal view to 
        consider that all men were actually truly equal. Many, including Lincoln 
        (and surprisingly Harriet Beecher Stowe), toyed with the idea of sending 
        the freedmen back to Africa. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How on earth could the two races co-exist, many wondered. 
        There were men who believed that African Americans should be free, but 
        to offer them the same standing as the men who fought to set them free 
        was unheard-of. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that Howard did not understand that this 
        prejudice had to be conquered before anything could ever happen to truly 
        foster a new nation based on equality. Howard, known as the "Christian 
        general," was just that, a great believer that the word of God would conquer. 
        He preached this to the freedmen and to the Southerners, telling them 
        that tolerance and understanding would bring peace. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard had great faith in the human heart, but he may 
        have had too much, for hotheaded Southerners were not in the forgiving 
        and welcoming mood. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having pasted together his new command, Howard set out 
        to deal with the issues of the day. Shelters, orphanages, food kitchens, 
        schools, and freedmen offices were opened throughout the South. In helping 
        these refugees, Howard's men did not discriminate between former slave 
        and former slave owner, since so many who were destitute in the South 
        were also poor white planters and farmers who had returned to find their 
        homes and lives destroyed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate tasks of offering food, shelter and medicine 
        got off to a good start, but the issues of land, civil rights, and lasting 
        communities needed the test of time and the support of the nation's government 
        officials. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard considered the Secretary of War's office friendly, 
        and he was sure that he had Congress's backing. But his assumption that 
        the new president, Andrew Johnson, would also support the Bureau's tasks 
        was a great mistake. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Johnson had other plans for the United States, 
        and they did not include the freedmen who had so recently been "liberated" 
        by five hundred thousand deaths and millions of other sacrifices.</p>
