      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a choice to make, and unfortunately, I chose poorly. 
        In retrospect, it was really a no-brainer, but I must have had a lapse 
        of reason and simple decision making skills. The choice was this: I could 
        either rent Terror Tract, a new horror film starring John Ritter (Three's 
        Company, Problem Child 1 and 2) or Caged Heat 2: Stripped of Freedom, 
        "If these girls were good, they wouldn't be in cages!" Unfortunately for 
        everybody (especially for myself) I chose the former. I am truly sorry. 
        I will make it up to all of you next week, I promise. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the mean time Terror Tract will have to suffice, but I 
        really don't have to tell you that it is a poor substitute. John Ritter, 
        who really wasn't that cool twenty years ago in Three's Company, and was 
        even less cool ten years ago in the Problem Child films, has now pretty 
        much reached the status of completely lame. He plays a real estate agent 
        who must make a sale on the last day to fill his quota, or the company 
        that employs him will torture his family. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You see, he shows houses in a haunted neighborhood, and the 
        company he works for is rather twisted as well. Unfortunately, with each 
        house he shows, he must reveal the reason why it's up for sale, under 
        the agency's full disclosure policy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing as how these houses are located in a haunted neighborhood, 
        each house has it's own horror story that led up to it being placed on 
        the market. Ritter shows three houses, making for three short stories 
        of chilling terror, or just plain boredom.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the stories really are pretty lousy, and I'll refrain 
        from giving a detailed account of them, but the remaining story was almost 
        worth the $3.98 rental fee. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Almost. The success of the story rests on the well-known 
        principle that a small live monkey wearing a bell hop outfit can be simultaneously 
        funny and creepy. It helps if the monkey is evil and kills people and/ 
        or house pets. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A little girl finds a monkey in bell hop garb in her backyard. 
        They soon become fast friends. She names him Bobo. When the little girl 
        brings her simian pal into her house, her father is suspicious. "I wonder 
        if there's anything unusual about that monkey," he says. Hmm, maybe the 
        fact that he's dressed as a bell hop and has befriended your daughter 
        in your own backyard. I might consider that unusual. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dad won't allow his daughter to keep the monkey in the house, 
        but she throws a tantrum. The monkey and the father exchange glances. 
        It is clear that neither one of them trusts the other. "I almost feel 
        like it's, I don't know, like it's evil," the father confides in his wife. 
        "Ron, it's just a monkey," she consoles him. Yeah, just a monkey in a 
        bell hop's outfit. Didn't we learn anything from The Wizard of Oz?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The father enters his daughter's bedroom to tuck her in. 
        He moves a few stuffed animals from her bed, only to reveal the monkey 
        hiding under the covers. Bobo shrieks and bites the father. He grabs the 
        monkey and stuffs it in a cage, leaving it in the living room to be guarded 
        by the family dog. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning he finds the cage empty and the dog stabbed 
        to death. The angered father confronts his daughter, "Don't give me that 
        innocent act, where's the damn monkey?!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The father sends his wife and daughter out of the house in 
        order to take care of the freaky little bastard. He hires an animal control 
        officer to kill the monkey, but Bobo has the upper hand and stabs the 
        officer with every kitchen knife in the house. Dad chases the little monkey 
        with a shotgun, but Bobo escapes from the house. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mother and daughter return and Dad sets a bear trap baited 
        with Fruit Loops in the backyard. Later that night, Bobo sneaks back into 
        the house and slits the mother's throat and returns into the daughter's 
        room to snuggle with her and fall asleep. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dad storms into the bedroom, brandishing the shotgun, "Your 
        mother's dead, now give me the monkey." A struggle ensues and the little 
        girl ends up shooting her father with the shotgun in order protect Bobo. 
        After all, they were close friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As I have already mentioned, the other two stories were not 
        nearly as powerful and touching, and John Ritter's presence in between 
        each tale didn't help matters much. The gist of the film is that with 
        each story he tells, Ritter loses another sale, a premise which gets old 
        after the first time around. Terror Tract gets a C-. Don't you dare miss 
        next week's column; prison has never been so hot.</p>
