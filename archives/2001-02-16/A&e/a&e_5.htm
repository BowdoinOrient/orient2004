      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Valentines Day = Shoot Me In The Face. Let me warn you that 
        this is going to be my first, and hopefully last, I'm A Bitter Woman article. 
        But honestly, even as I am sitting here writing this article I am still 
        expecting some amazingly attractive man to walk into my Tower quad laden 
        with flowers and chocolate and take me out to dinner where we will be 
        witty, endearing and honest and drink wine and fall in love. How does 
        one day have such grossly delusional capacities ? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I know that it will never happen and yet…every time the phone 
        rings I'm like, "This is it," and so I dive for the phone and then let 
        it ring twice so as not to betray my eagerness, only to have it be one 
        of my friends asking me for directions to the sushi restaurant she and 
        her boyfriend are going to for their romantic dinner. Then in a hesitant, 
        perhaps-I-don't-want-to-know voice, she asks what I have planned for dinner. 
        Ah, kind friend, how good of you to ask. In fact I am not even leaving 
        the building. I'm planning on taking the elevator down only four flights 
        of stairs because I am a big lazy bum, and then I will mope around with 
        all the rest of the singletons while a romantically lit Thorne mocks us 
        all. I plan on having Passion Potato Leek Soup and Romeo's Refried Beans, 
        so, thank you for asking, Cruella. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Honestly, the day just makes me hate everything much more 
        than before. I wake up and I'm all full of hope, envisioning my mailbox 
        bursting with Valentines. Then I go through the ritual picking out of 
        the Valentines outfit. Now don't lie, readers, everyone goes through this. 
        Everyone wants to wear the red sweater, but then actively chooses another 
        outfit that purposely has no red in it at all so that later when the annoying 
        girl is like "Hey Grumpy, where's your red!?" you can be like "Oh, I didn't 
        even think about it." Liar! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You wanted to wear the red sweater, but you're just too cool. 
        Isn't it weird what we base our conceptions of coolness on? Granted there 
        will be a few who will be like "Oh, she's wearing red, that's kind of 
        lame." But it's not like a week later they're going to be like "Hey, remember 
        when Julianna Strohem wore red on Valentines Day? Man, that was so lame. 
        Bet she'll never live that down."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, once I'm dressed, I make a mental list of people 
        who might be in love with me and then muse about what a conundrum I will 
        be in if they all send me Valentines. Whomever will I choose? How could 
        I break their sweet little hearts? The whole walk over to the Union is 
        by far the best part of the day. Humming and skipping, waiting to see 
        just who it is has their heart set on me this year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Inevitably though my mailbox will have two or three Valentines, 
        all from female friends, depicting Winnie the Pooh and Piglet hand in 
        hand skipping into the distance and written in the clouds overhead is 
        "It's always better with two." This makes me feel oh so much better; perhaps 
        on this day of love if I can't find a man, perhaps I will find a small 
        pig to run off with instead. Or I'll get one declaring that Scooby Doo 
        "Rants to re ry Ralentine. Rrreee hee hee hee." Translation "Wants to 
        be my Valentine. Maniacal Scooby Doo Laughter."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Could we perhaps make this a biannual event? Or maybe Valentines 
        Day (observed) meaning that it's like a Canadian holiday and we therefore 
        pay no attention to it at all? I don't know if I can take another one. 
        Because starting February 15, I'm going to think to myself, well next 
        year it is going to be much much better. And then there will be 364 days 
        of building up expectations all over again, only to have them smashed 
        to sad little pieces by Winnie The Pooh, Scooby Doo and all of their smirking 
        cohorts. </p>
