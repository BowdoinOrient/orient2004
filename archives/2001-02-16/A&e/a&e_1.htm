      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to respond to a growing need in the Brunswick 
        community, the Bowdoin Korean-American Students Association has created 
        a Korean School designed to teach the Korean language and customs to those 
        who wish to learn more about the culture. Says KASA member Brian Ryu, 
        "(KASA) felt that we wanted to reach out and give back to the community." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Within Bowdoin College's Asian Studies program are Chinese 
        and Japanese language classes, but the college is currently without a 
        Korean language program, despite the relatively large amount of interest 
        in developing such a program. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Those already involved in the KASA Korean School include 
        families who have adopted Korean children and a large number of non-Korean 
        Bowdoin students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The school will also attempt to make it easier for Brunswick 
        residents to learn more about Korean culture without having to drive to 
        Portland to attend the Korean School at a local church. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; According to Heather Park, a Bowdoin student and one of the 
        founders of the Korean School, there are already 20 students "enrolled" 
        in the Korean class. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; She first became aware of the need for such a school after 
        being approached in the grocery store and at church by families who have 
        adopted children from Korea and wanted their children to have contact 
        with other Korean children and the culture. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Park stresses how helpful the KASA and the administration 
        have been in helping to create the school. Says Park, "We have a team 
        of dedicated teachers who come in and organize the classes and teach every 
        Saturday solely on a volunteer basis."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The curriculum will be mainly devoted to learning how to 
        speak, write, and read Korean and will last approximately two hours. The 
        first hour will be primarily concerned with the instruction of language, 
        followed by a short snack break. The second hour will introduce an element 
        of Korean culture to the students, generally involving an activity like 
        cooking or singing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The program will finish at the end of the semester with a 
        Korean banquet, with members of the class learning the names of the dishes 
        and ingredients of typical Korean food. The Korean school is an earnest 
        attempt to combine learning and fun in order to bring a necessary educationcal 
        element to the Bowdoin and Brunswick community.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The school will run every Saturday from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. 
        Please contact Heather Park at hpark@bowdoin.edu for school location information.</p>
