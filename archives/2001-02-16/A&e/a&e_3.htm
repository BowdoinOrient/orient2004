      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Olds has decided to awards A's to students in 
        his classes who can who create a convincing copy of a piece of art held 
        within Bowdoin's own collection that was studied within the class. The 
        forgeries will then be mixed up with the real works and it will be the 
        classes' exams to determine who created each work of art. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting move, huh? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Too bad it's all a lie. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Clifton Olds of the Art History spoke on the topic 
        of "The Artist as Criminal: Fakes, Frauds, and Forgeries" - beginning 
        the evening off with a "forgery" of his own like the one above - a made-up 
        story about art fraud good enough to fool the audience into believing 
        it. (Well, he fooled me anyway. That's why I thought I'd try to fool some 
        people on my own.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; February 13 marked the second semester reintroduction of 
        the Quinby House Tuesday Lecture Series. Professor Olds spoke to an audience 
        of about 15- 20 students on the subject of art forgery. The professor 
        admits a "grudging admiration for criminals…[they are] con men who take 
        advantage of other people's greed." It's easy to be awed by the lengths 
        that some forgers will go to to deceive everyone. In a series of stories 
        (which he swore were all true, after his initial forged tale), Professor 
        Olds gave examples of different modes by which forgers had worked. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The signature of the artist on a painting makes the work 
        more desirable and special. ers either fake a different signature on an 
        existing painting. Sometimes, already established artists will sign the 
        works of their students, so that the paintings will sell for more than 
        they would otherwise. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Another example was of an artist who had been popular early 
        in his career, and then faded away. This artist backdated a work he did 
        by about 30 years, so he could sell it for the price that a work from 
        his more popular period would command. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A mind-boggling example of a forger's attention to detail 
        was illustrated with what was thought to be an Albrecht Dürer print. The 
        thousands and thousands of tiny lines making up a picture with a lion 
        in the foreground of a room were all perfectly copied. A student noticed 
        that lion on the so-called print actually was missing a toenail from the 
        known stamp. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; First, it was just thought that Dürer made a print, then 
        altered the stamp again before making the rest. However, they measured 
        the "print," only to discover it measured a few millimeters larger than 
        a real print would have - therefore the whole picture was a forged drawing. 
        Such staggering attention to tedious detail does make one almost admire 
        forgers, for such sheer dedication. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Some forgeries are really good - some even better, in the 
        opinion of art critics like Professor Olds, than works by the artist being 
        copied.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He showed the audience slides of two paintings - one a real 
        Vincent Van Gogh self-portrait, the other a forgery. The audience was 
        approximately evenly split over which of the two paintings we liked better. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, when Professor Olds told us which painting was the 
        real Van Gogh, most people, including Olds, said that if they were going 
        to have of one the paintings, they would prefer the real Van Gogh to the 
        painting they had chosen as better. It is an interesting idea to think 
        about - are we really appreciating the art for itself, or because of previous 
        experiences with other ideas?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; To get some idea of how difficult it can be to determine 
        if a work of art is a forgery or not, Professor Olds gave this example: 
        Henri Matisse once gave an art dealer 20 drawings. The dealer had them 
        for awhile, but was finally going to sell them. Matisse hadn't signed 
        them, so the dealer called him to have him do so. Matisse studied the 
        drawings, and declared that only 14 of the 20 were his work. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Though the dealer reminded him that he'd given them to him 
        altogether, Matisse could not be convinced. So he signed only the 14. 
        The dealer was disappointed, but there was really nothing he could do. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Later in the day, Matisse came back to the office and asked 
        to see the other six drawings again. He studied them, and then, without 
        a word, signed them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; If it was that difficult for Matisse to recognize his own 
        work, imagine the task that lies before art critics in determining if 
        work is genuine or not. Some estimates say that as much as 50 percent 
        of the work in minor museums is forged. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Renoir, in particular, has been forged a huge amount - some 
        estimates claim that 75 percent of "his" work around the world is by some 
        one else. If we enjoy the work, does it matter who did it? Or would we 
        prefer to see only real Renoirs? Either answer seems valid, and the answer 
        is sure to be contemplated by those who attended the lecture. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Stay tuned for more coverage of the Quinby House Tuesday 
        Night Lecture Series as it continues later in the semester. </p>
