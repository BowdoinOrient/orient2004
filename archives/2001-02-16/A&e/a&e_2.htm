      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So Valentine's Day may be behind us, but the Film Society 
        needs a chance to feel the love. So we present to you, our loyal film 
        fans, the Big, Cute Valentine's Day Weekend. Maybe there's a special someone 
        you were too afraid to approach on Wednesday. Well, now you have a second 
        chance! Bring her/him to our films; they are almost as potent as the sweet 
        sounds of Marvin Gaye. Mmmmm. Friday night, we have a pair of cute classics 
        from Rob Reiner. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; These are guaranteed to be funny (if you don't know why, 
        you haven't been paying enough attention to my articles). On Saturday 
        there are two films a bit more offbeat; not your normal romantic movies. 
        As always, there will be lots of people having fun in the darkened confines 
        of Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall. And since we are so open-minded, we don't 
        change anything and you can bring any friends you find.</p>

        <i>When Harry Met Sally…</i> (1989) <br>
        Directed by: Rob Reiner <br>
        Starring: Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan, Carrie Fisher, Bruno Kirby <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Hard to believe that a sweet guy like me has never seen this 
        film, but it's true. So let's see, what do I know about it? Billy and 
        Meg are two friends who go through a bunch of relationships trying to 
        remain "only friends." Things happen, and, um, they become "good friends," 
        if you catch my drift. The script is by Nora Ephron, who brought us Sleepless 
        in Seattle, so you know it will be good. And since I'm a warehouse of 
        useless info, I'll tell you to look for Rob Reiner's mom in the orgasm 
        scene. No, he didn't put his mom in a sex scene! You'll know the scene 
        when you see it. I can't say you will definitely enjoy this film, as I 
        have never seen. But most of my friends love it, and you have to think 
        that any movie that has a dot-dot-dot (i.e. ellipsis) in the title will 
        be good. <b>Rated R </b></p>

        <i>The Princess Bride</i> (1987) <br>
        Directed by: Rob Reiner <br>
        Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright Penn, Mandy Patinkin, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Wallace Shawn, Andre the Giant, Christopher Guest, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Chris Sarandon, Peter Falk, Fred Savage, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Billy Crystal, Carol Kane <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Wow, this movie is good. You might even be tempted to say 
        it's Reiner's best (then you think, oh wait, he made Spinal Tap!). It 
        is enormously funny, with absolutely great lines, situations, and characters. 
        All the acting is perfect. Christopher Guest proves himself, once again, 
        as one of the best comic actors around. Mandy Patinkin is very moving. 
        Wallace Shawn is his annoying self. And Andre the Giant has a posse, so 
        no one's going to say he can't act. As for plot, think of any fairy tale 
        cliché, and this movie probably has it: swordfights, magic, evil princes, 
        great narrators, monsters, and a happy ending that can't help but make 
        you smile. You know you love this movie, so come see it. <b>Rated PG </b></p>

        <i>The Graduate</i> (1967) <br>
        Directed by: Mike Nichols <br>
        Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katherine Ross Dustin <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Hoffman plays a recent college graduate without any direction. 
        What does he do? Get seduced by the infamous Mrs. Robinson. The scenes 
        of their affair are extremely awkward, yet very funny. Unfortunately, 
        he has to break off their romance and then falls for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, 
        Elaine. He becomes obsessed with her, following her right up to her wedding 
        at the film's climax. So much of this film is classic. Even if you've 
        never seen it, you'll recognize shots and lines because they have been 
        used in so many other contexts. Best of all, though, is the absolutely 
        marvelous soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel. Yeah, Marvin Gaye may sound 
        dead sexy, but I don't think you are going to find any voices more beautiful 
        than these two are. It is so romantic and beyond classic. <b>Rated PG 
        </b></p>

        <i>Harold & Maude</i> (1971) <br>
        Directed by: Hal Ashby <br>
        Starring: Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Cyril Cusack, Vivian Pickles <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Before I started writing this article, the only thing I could 
        have told you about this movie was that it is one of Mary's favorites. 
        After a little research, here's what I've discovered. There is a 20-year 
        old male who is obsessed with suicide. He also enjoys going to funerals. 
        At one such event, he meets a crazy 80-year old woman. Yup, they start 
        a relationship. Now you might think that could be pretty gross, but this 
        movie is supposedly really entertaining and funny. It comes very highly 
        recommended from within the ranks of the Film Society, so it must be good. 
        The great Cat Stevens performs the soundtrack, so like the Graduate, this 
        film is worth listening to as well as watching. <b>Rated PG </b></p>
