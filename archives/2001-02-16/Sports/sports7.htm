      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the strength of 54 percent field goal shooting and 
        a stifling defense, the men's basketball team crushed the University of 
        Maine at Farmington on the road Tuesday evening by the score of 89-52. 
        Bolstered by a huge first half from junior wing-man Greg Orlicz, the Polar 
        Bears jumped out to a 48-23 halftime lead and never looked back. En route 
        to victory, Bowdoin (14-7, 3-4 NESCAC) held UMF (7-14) to just 31 percent 
        shooting from the field.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The constantly improving Orlicz scored 16 of his game-high 
        23 points in the first half. In all, he was an impressive 9-14 from the 
        floor and needed just 22 minutes of action to exact his damage. Joining 
        Orlicz in double figures were Danny Ginn '03 and senior Erich Buschmann, 
        who contributed 10 points apiece. Senior Dave Baranowski added 9 points 
        and 10 rebounds in just 19 minutes on the floor.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real story of the evening, however, belonged to 
        senior captain Greg Lovely. With about three minutes remaining in the 
        contest, Lovely was fouled and stoically marched to the free-throw line 
        in search of a little slice of Bowdoin basketball history. After missing 
        his first attempt, a cool, calm, and collected Lovely swished the second 
        and became only the 673rd [number is unofficial at best, made up at worst] 
        Polar Bear to amass 10 career points. Pandemonium ensued.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a post-game press conference, Lovely quipped: "There 
        was talk that the game might be halted when I reached the historic milestone, 
        but-being the consummate team player and sportsman that I am-I didn't 
        want to disrupt the flow of the game."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a much less positive note, an injury-riddled Polar 
        Bear squad suffered a 73-52 road loss Saturday afternoon at the hands 
        of rival Colby College (15-7). In a key NESCAC matchup, Bowdoin was overpowered 
        by a dominant inside game and some timely White Mule shooting. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game-described by loyal Bowdoin fans who made the 
        pilgrimage to Waterville as "ugly"-was controlled by Colby from the outset, 
        with the outcome never really in doubt. The White Mules cruised to a 40-25 
        halftime advantage and Bowdoin was unable to reduce the lead to single 
        figures.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright spots for a dismal Polar Bear offensive attack 
        that managed a season-low 52 points were Ranslow, who led Bowdoin with 
        14 points and six rebounds, and Ginn, who came off the bench and knocked 
        down three trifectas en route to 9 points. </p>
