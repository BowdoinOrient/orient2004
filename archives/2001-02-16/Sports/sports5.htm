      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took an extra period in Waterville but the Bowdoin 
        College women's hockey team completed a season sweep of Colby with a 1-0 
        overtime victory on Tuesday night. The win made the Bears a perfect 3-0 
        on the (extended) weekend, which also saw them defeat Wesleyan and Connecticut 
        College.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin's first 33 were turned aside by the White Mules 
        goalie, and it wasn't until over an hour of hockey had been played that 
        the 34th shot of the evening for the Bears found the back of the net. 
        That final shot came off the stick of sophomore Beth Muir just minutes 
        into the extra frame; she was assisted on the goal by Alyson Lizotte '03 
        and Britney Carr '04. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin was in charge the entire game, constantly on 
        the attack, and more than doubling Colby's shots on goal. Emily McKissock 
        '03 turned aside all 15 shots to blank the Mules for the second time in 
        as many tries, and pick up her third shutout on the season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Carr's third straight game with a point; she 
        had five goals in the two games over the weekend and was named the NESCAC 
        Player of the Week. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carr had two scores to spark the Bowdoin comeback in 
        a 4-2 victory at Wesleyan. Her first goal put the Bears up 1-0 early in 
        the first; Wesleyan would answer quickly and take a 2-1 lead by tallying 
        the only goal of the second period. Carr evened the score when she picked 
        up her second goal of the night at the start of the final period. Fellow 
        first-year Gillian McDonald would net the game-winner with 4:38 to play, 
        and Ba Lanoue '03 would add an empty netter to bring the final score to 
        4-2. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next night Carr picked up her first hat trick to 
        lead the 9-0 drubbing of Connecticut College. She wasn't the only Bear 
        to put three on the board on Saturday night as Shelly Chessie '03 racked 
        up a hat trick of her own. Three other Bowdoin players would score to 
        complete the rout of the Camels; all told nine women would pick up a point 
        for the Bears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francesca Klucevek-Whalen '03 was in the net for the 
        Bears, stopping 15 shots on the evening to pick up the victory. It was 
        her fifth win on the season and her third shutout of the year, all in 
        just five starts.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears' three game winning streak upped their record 
        to 14-3-3 overall and 10-3-3 in the conference. In addition to adding 
        to their win total Bowdoin has moved up a spot in the national rankings 
        to #5 this week.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They sit squarely in third place in the ECAC behind 
        perennial powerhouses Middlebury and Williams. With just three games left 
        in the regular season Bowdoin is poised for a postseason run. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am extremely hopeful [about] our postseason prospects," 
        said senior co-captain Kim Mimnaugh. She continued, "Regarding what is 
        needed for success at ECACs, I believe that we need to play our systems 
        diligently and take advantage of teams from the start of the game by going 
        hard right from the first face off." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that the Bears are looking past any of their last 
        three opponents though. They are hoping to finish up strong as they host 
        last place Trinity and Amherst this weekend to finish up their ECAC schedule. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears will then head down 95 to take on the Boston 
        College squad Tuesday night in Bean Town. The playoffs await them the 
        following weekend. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're on campus this weekend head over to Dayton 
        and watch the Bears take it to Trinity and Amherst, then check back next 
        week to find out how the Bears fared and who Bowdoin will likely face 
        in the postseason.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then, as always, Go U Bears!! </p>
