      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a week for the men's hockey team. After taking 
        a loss at Amherst last Friday, the team rebounded to defeat Trinity, but 
        fell back against Colby this week. The team is now in the playoffs, but 
        does not yet know its opponents.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's clear that it has been a mixed week for the Bears. 
        "We've done well against some of the top teams in NESCAC, but we didn't 
        show up to play against Colby and Amherst," first-year Mike Stevens said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday, the Bears bowed to Amherst in a lopsided 
        game. After eight minutes of the second quarter, the Jeffs had taken a 
        4-0 lead. About a minute later, Mike Carosi '02 put Bowdoin's only goal 
        on the board, assisted by sophomore Jared Porter. Amherst ended up on 
        the winning side of a 6-1 score. "We didn't have a strong game," head 
        coach Terry Meagher said. "They're one of the best teams in the league. 
        We didn't have our game in order, and it led to a tough loss."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin Robinson '01 made eight saves before first-year 
        Mike Healey stepped in, adding eight of his own. Brian Losier '01 had 
        four saves, bringing the Bears' total for the night to 20.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday afternoon, the Bears put things together 
        more successfully. "We didn't do anything too much different," Meagher 
        said. "It's pretty tough to change things up late in the season." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A goal by Chris Pelletier '04, in the first two minutes 
        of the opening period, started things off for the Bears. Sophomore Adam 
        Mantin dished an assist to Brian Shuman '02 three minutes later, who would 
        go on to complete his second career hat trick in the game. Trinity's Denis 
        Petrov put one past Robinson before the first period's conclusion, but 
        the Bantams wouldn't get any closer to tying the score. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second period, Shuman converted a feed from Stevens 
        during a man-up advantage and Sean Starke '03 quickly followed with another 
        Bear goal, assisted by Porter and Pelletier. Shuman completed his hat 
        trick with about four minutes left in the second frame, pushing an unassisted 
        goal past Trinity keeper Geoffrey Faulkner. The game would see one more 
        goal from each team in the final period; Bowdoin's coming from Stevens 
        with four minutes to play.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final tally had the Bears on top, 6-2. "It felt 
        great to come back and beat Trinity like that," Stevens said. We were 
        really fired up to play."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears couldn't hold a victorious streak, however. 
        They traveled to Colby last Tuesday, and fell short in a 5-2 loss. Reminiscent 
        of the Amherst game, the White Mules had gathered a commanding 5-0 lead 
        by the second period's halfway mark.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With six minutes left to play, Sean Starke '03 found 
        senior John Glynne for the Bears' first goal. Five minutes later, Shuman 
        scored off a Stevens assist, but the Colby lead was insurmountable. "We 
        got better as the game went on, but weren't connecting," Coach Meagher 
        said. "We made some coverage errors that led to their goals."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the up-and-down weekend, the Bears have secured 
        a playoff spot. "We're in, but we don't know who we're playing yet," Meagher 
        said. "We've got two more league games this weekend, and they will tell 
        everything." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men take on Babson at home tonight at 7:00, and 
        follow up with a visit from UMass Boston tomorrow at 4:00. Coach Meagher 
        indicated that the team is up for the weekend, and is excited about the 
        challenges ahead. "[Making the playoffs] was our goal, so now we are trying 
        to get ourselves to be playing our best hockey."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevens agreed. "I'm pretty confident about the playoffs," 
        he said. "We've got a team that can go in and win some games." The divisional 
        playoff schedule will be available in the next week; in the meantime, 
        cheer on the Bears this weekend. </p>
