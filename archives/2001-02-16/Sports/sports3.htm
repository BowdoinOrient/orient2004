      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, hundreds of students participate in an 
        activity that garners minimal attention from those unaffiliated. The participants 
        do not strut around in gear sponsoring their endeavor and do not post 
        signs for fans to attend their games. They are the many, the proud, the 
        brave-the intramural athletes who play for the love of the game.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, perhaps that above description was not entirely 
        accurate. As a fellow intramuraler reminded me, "The few very lucky get 
        T-shirts to wear around." These upper-echelon members unabashedly flaunt 
        their hard-earned reward and inspire the hearts and souls of their competition 
        to reach one of the most sacred goals: intramural glory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My former roommate and a member of the Bowdoin cross-country 
        and track team once referred to intramural sports as "fake glory" due 
        to his status as a bona fide athlete who plays a sport that someone outside 
        of the Bowdoin Bubble gives a hoot about. My other roommate and I then 
        proceed to rip off his shirt and slap him on the back until he apologized.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in reality, where else are you going to find a 
        collection of men and women who play a sport together-despite varying 
        abilities-to achieve a common goal? Some intramural super stars have varsity-level 
        skills, but the vast majority try to excel in a sport for which they have 
        a modest knowledge and ability to play. Nevertheless, they play hurt, 
        they play with intensity and hustle, they feel the bitter sorrow of defeat, 
        and they exult in victory. And oh yeah, they talk a huge game. But what's 
        wrong with dreaming?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking smack is a definite component of intramural 
        sports. The trash talking is only sporadically backed, but it always helps 
        develop rivalries and allows the contestants to feel like self-assured 
        jocks for about an hour. After the game, the players shake hands, apologize 
        for any rough and tumble play, and talk about the nasty plays they made 
        on the walk home.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other times, these participants limp home because they 
        are licking their wounds from a sour loss or because an old injury is 
        catching up to them. But, mainly, they take the slow, long walk home because 
        they don't want their glimpse of intramural glory to vanish. intramural 
        glory, however, is not the only factor motivating Bowdoin students to 
        recklessly play a sport for which they really don't train.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boss prophesized that "glory days will pass you 
        by," but for many intramuralers the competition brings them back to days 
        of old. Says intramural hockey and basketball player Kevin Park '03, "I 
        play because it reminds me of glory days when I used to play competitive 
        sports. The competition of intramurals gives me that same feeling of being 
        part of a team and striving for a goal."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For brief moments when an intramuraler is handling a 
        puck, driving to the basket, or striking a soccer ball, he or she is able 
        to feel the passion and desire that drove them in days of yore. There 
        is also an undeniable purity that makes intramural sports special. The 
        participants compete for the love of the sport, the camaraderie, and the 
        chance to showcase their abilities. Intramuralers play the game with a 
        free and easy attitude knowing that their loss does not reflect upon the 
        entire school, and their actions for the most part do not portray an image 
        of Bowdoin to the rest of the country. As a result, the pressures associated 
        with intramural play are minimal and winning is an endeavor motivated 
        from within.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So next time someone tells you that they play basketball, 
        softball, soccer, hockey, or any other sport at the intramural level, 
        don't respond with the usual "oh." There is much more that goes into intramural 
        sports and more that the participants get out of them than many assume.
