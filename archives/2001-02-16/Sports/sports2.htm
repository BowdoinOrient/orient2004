      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women entered the field house at Bates with one 
        goal: to walk out later that evening as State Champions. Little did they 
        know what the night had in store for them. From doubling and even tripling 
        in events, to running through season ending injuries, the team successfully 
        pulled together to defeat Colby, Bates and the University of Southern 
        Maine by over thirty points. The goal was attained.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the bravest moment on the track was seen in 
        the 800m run. Kate Waller '02, who has endured a foot injury for the better 
        part of the season, tore the ligaments in her foot during her race. "Waller's 
        800 was one of the most courageous races I've ever seen. Kate knew the 
        team needed her to finish the race even though she injured her foot seriously 
        after 600 meters. She ran the final 200 meters in a lot of pain, and finished 
        in second place. She's one of the toughest athletes I've ever coached," 
        comments Coach Slovenski.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high jump also provided an interesting outcome. 
        With the height of the bar at 5'5", none of the jumpers successfully cleared 
        the height, leaving a seven-way tie for first place; four of the seven 
        jumpers were Bowdoin women. After a jump-off amongst the seven, Julia 
        Febiger '03 emerged victorious while Ellie Doig '03, Liz Wendell'03 and 
        Caitlin Fowkes '03 tied for second place. This was an impressive feat 
        considering that the high jump competition lasted for over two hours and 
        the jumpers competed in other events while still in the high jump competition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pole vault Marika Decyk '02 claimed first place 
        with a vault of 10' while Wendell and Anne Barmettler '03 claimed the 
        fifth and sixth scoring positions. The triple jumpers were a great contribution 
        to the team's victory; Casey Kelley '02, Karen Yeoman '02 and Acadia Senese 
        '03 placed second, third, and fourth. This performance was simultaneous 
        with the 4x400m relay where Yeoman and Kelley ran the first and second 
        leg of the race (with Brittany Blanchette '04 and Shaina Zamitis '02 running 
        third and fourth leg) that finished in second place, less than a second 
        behind Colby.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sprinters also claimed victories throughout the 
        evening. Sara Bodnar '03 won the 55m and Kristin Dummer '04 and Bodnar 
        placed first and second in the 200m. The 4x200m relay, run by Weeks '03, 
        Bodnar, Kat Martens '04 and Dummer, finished first as well. The middle 
        distance runners were a huge contribution to the meet. Martens placed 
        second in the 400m with Lynne Davies '04, and Blanchette finishing fifth 
        and sixth. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 800m runners claimed first, second and third place 
        with Jane Cullina '04, Waller and Bre-Anne MacKenna's '03 strong finishes. 
        The 4x800m team also finished in first with a strong third leg run by 
        Kate Brinkerhoff '03, who out-kicked the Bates runner to take the lead. 
        In the 600m run Febiger, Zamitis and Brinkerhoff finished first, second 
        and fifth. Febiger had an outsanding evening, winning both the 600m and 
        the high jump. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Slovenski remarks, "Julia Febiger has been the 
        leading scorer for our team all winter, and she competed like a champion 
        on Friday night. She shows a lot of poise under pressure."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the distance races, Kala Hardacker '04 and Libby 
        Barney '03 finished first and second respectively in the 1000m and 1500m. 
        Jesse Gray also ran a strong 3000m race and claimed a second place finish. 
        The men's team supported the women throughout the meet, hollering names 
        and encouraging runners, throwers and jumpers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state meet was a great meet for the women and the 
        team is looking to place well at New England's this Saturday at Brandeis.
