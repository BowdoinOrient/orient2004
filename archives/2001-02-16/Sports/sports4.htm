      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week you got to meet one of the leaders of Bowdoin's 
        men's hockey team, this week you'll get to know one of the leaders of 
        the women's hockey team. Anchoring the team from her defense position, 
        Gloria Sonnen is a four-year letter-winner and wears the C for a second 
        time this season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonnen's leadership has been instrumental in shaping 
        a young team and helping them to develop into the force that they are 
        today. Coach Michele Amidon credits Sonnen with "molding a very young 
        group of hockey players into not only a talented team, but a team of good 
        citizens as well." Amidon continued, calling Gloria "someone a coach never 
        wants to lose and when you have to, you wish she could be your assistant 
        coach!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonnen's leadership, in addition to her record of community 
        service, has earned her a place as one of the finalists for the 2001 Hockey 
        Humanitarian Award Foundation's Hockey Humanitarian Award. According to 
        the Foundation's mission statement, "The Humanitarian Award acknowledges 
        the accomplishments of personal character, scholarship, and the giving 
        of oneself off the ice to the larger community as well." In her nomination 
        of Sonnen, Amidon said, "As her coach, I feel that Gloria's value extends 
        far beyond points, assists, wins, and losses. Gloria Sonnen doesn't just 
        talk about making the world a better place; instead she absorbs herself 
        in that endeavor."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is indeed much more to Sonnen than an outstanding 
        leader and hockey player. She is a member of the Residential Life Staff 
        serving as head proctor for Appleton this year. Sonnen also belongs to 
        many other campus organizations including the Student Advisory Committee, 
        Warriors, the Young Alumni Leadership Program, and Bears and Cubs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the ice, Sonnenis from Minnesota where, 
        she says, "You're kind of born on skates." It wasn't until high school, 
        however, that Sonnen first began playing real, organized hockey. She credits 
        Coach Amidon with helping to generate her passion for hockey at the college 
        level. She also cited Amidon as a role model, saying, "She's played at 
        the game's highest levels, and she is an incredible teacher and a great 
        person to learn from." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonnen has been very pleased with the team this season, 
        calling it the most talented squad that Bowdoin has had. "When we put 
        our minds to it we can beat anyone," she said. "I look forward to taking 
        another shot at the defending National Champs [Middlebury]." She also 
        spoke very highly of the team dynamics, "It's so much fun to have such 
        a great group of people to hang out with, on and off the ice." Sonnen 
        called the team "down to earth" and claims to not have any superstitions-just 
        habits. Hockey provides Sonnen with an arena of competition outside of 
        academics; she also said that it provides her with great stress relief. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Psychology major, Sonnen is interested in a career 
        in social service; she is considering Americorps after graduation. Nothing 
        has been finalized though. "It's more fun that way," she says. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of where she ends up after Bowdoin, hockey 
        has been a big part of her time here. "I can't imagine life at Bowdoin 
        without hockey," Sonnen said. When she graduates she'll be missed on the 
        ice and not easily forgotten. Coach Amidon had this to say;"I know that 
        Sonnen's legacy will live on at Bowdoin as a model captain and good citizen 
        for many years to come." </p>
