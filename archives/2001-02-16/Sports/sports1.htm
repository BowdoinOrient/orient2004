      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the gun sounded and the runners of the 4x800m relay 
        teams started, the Walter Solvenski Indoor Track, at Bates College, shut 
        down. Literally. Due to a power outage during the first lap of the event, 
        the race was run in complete darkness, for several minutes, until the 
        emergency lights came on. Even then the remainder of the race was run 
        in 75 percent darkness. To add to the confusion, the officials, straining 
        to see in the dark, miscounted the number of laps run by several of the 
        runners. "It was incredible. It was as dark as a closet…When the emergency 
        lights came on dimly at one end of the field house, it was a very exciting 
        atmosphere for a race," said Coach Peter Slovenski.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the brief chaos caused by the power outage, 
        the Bowdoin men cruised to victory, defeating Bates College, University 
        of Southern Maine, and Colby College, to win the Maine State Meet for 
        the second year in a row. The Polar Bears dominated nearly every event 
        on Saturday, while fending off a very good Bates team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were running, jumping, and throwing well the entire 
        meet, but we were either even with Bates or ahead by only about 10 points 
        all night. The 5000m and the triple jump were two of the last three events 
        contested, and it turned out that they were our highest scoring events. 
        The 5000m guys and triple jumpers came through at a critical time for 
        the team," said Slovenski.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the victory churned out by Bowdoin was due in 
        large part to the cheering and support of the beautiful Bowdoin women's 
        indoor track team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team, scantily cald in sports bras, with 
        body paint on their toned stomachs, could have been a tactical ploy employed 
        by the Bowdoin men to distract and beguile their competition. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the runners, jumpers and throwers all did 
        their jobs. "We needed big performances from every person in the meet 
        and we got them," said Captain Steve Allison '01.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff Manganaro '01 sprinted to victory in the 55m dash 
        and the 4x400m relay team, turning in a convincing victory. The 55m high 
        hurdles was a strong event for the Bowdoin men, who took the second, third 
        and fourth spots in the race. The middle distance runners stayed tough 
        to beat with Rob Mandle '02 and Evan Matzen '03 finishing one-two in the 
        600m. A few minutes later, in the 800m, Byron Boots '03 and Mike Pesa-Fallon 
        '02 capped off another Bowdoin one-two finish. In the distance events, 
        Allison and Dan Gulotta '03 finished first and fourth respectively, in 
        both the 1000m and the mile race. Allison breezed to victory in the mile, 
        running an impressive 4:20. The 5000m race was won by Pat Vardaro '03 
        in a time of 15:22. Vardaro was closely followed by Scott Barbuto '03 
        and Todd Forsgren '03.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year class delivered some strong performances 
        with Brian Grandjean placing second in the pole vault, James Wilkins winning 
        the high jump, and Tim Mathien leaping to victory in the triple jump. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, Bowdoin's top 25 track athletes will travel 
        to Tufts to compete in the New England III Indoor Track Championship. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin is seeded 5th out of 25 teams in New England 
        III. Last year, the Bowdoin men were seeded 4th, but had a remarkable 
        day from Matt Volk '03 and Chris Davidson '03, who scored 16 points to 
        help Bowdoin upset Williams and Bates for second place (behind M.I.T). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I feel good about our team. We're a talented and caring 
        group of athletes. Regardless of time or place this team will put forth 
        its best effort on Saturday. When we leave, we'll have left everything 
        on the track," said Allison. </p>
