      <p>Jon Knapp '02, Caroline Budney '03, and Anne Gustafson '02, veteran members 
        of Bowdoin's Stoned Clown Ultimate Frisbee Team, are not afraid of clowns. 
        &quot;I think that we're scary, but I'm not scared of clowns,&quot; asserted 
        Knapp.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stoned Clown Ultimate, whose first tournament of the year takes place 
        on September 23 in Seekonk, Massachusetts, plans to strike fear into the 
        hearts of its opponents this fall. Knapp said he believes the team will 
        outperform last year's season in which Stoned Clown advanced to the regional 
        tournament at Fort Devens, Mass., and came within one point of winning 
        the Kind Bud Bowl in the spring.<br>

          <td><font size="2">An intense ultimate session last Wednesday. Stoned 
            Clown is taking its skills to schools like Harvard this year. (Henry 
            Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p>Several experienced senior players graduated last spring, but due to 
        plenty of first-year players and motivated upperclassmen, Stoned Clown 
        has an optimistic outlook for the fall season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Stoned Clown's primary disc handlers include Knapp, Sam Terry '04, and 
        Caleb DuBois '02. Sophomore Brendan Dickinson, another handler, is &quot;a 
        really incredible player,&quot; according to Knapp, and junior Alex Rosati 
        is remarkable for both his speed and the fact that he has &quot;no sense 
        of pain.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Anjali Dotson '04 is an outstanding player because she, as Budney said, 
        has &quot;good vision of the field and great hands.&quot; Gustafson identified 
        Anne Larkin '03 as an &quot;up and coming&quot; player.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stoned Clown's offense is structured by a general guideline, within which 
        the players often improvise. They also run set plays. The team likes to 
        mix up its offensive style, interchanging a strong give-and-go offense 
        with long passes.<br>
        Harvard and Tufts will be Stoned Clown's toughest trials this fall, while 
        old rivalries will be revisited when the team competes against the likes 
        of Bates and Brown.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Athletes are drawn to ultimate for a variety of reasons. Budney cited 
        the camaraderie among women on all the teams as a primary reason she enjoys 
        the game. Knapp enjoys that fact that he gets &quot;a cut on my forearm 
        at the beginning of the season and it just never goes away.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Players appreciate that ultimate is a self-refereed game. &quot;Ultimate 
        players are empowered with the ability to make their own decisions,&quot; 
        said Gustafson. &quot;This adds a really unique aspect to the game.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ultimate is a unique sport, the only one to encourage costumes on the 
        field and humorous, improvised cheers at the end of the game. Budney said 
        that she has developed great relationships that were unique to a frisbee 
        squad and that the team &quot;is a really tight group.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team's unique name originated from a piece of furniture handed down 
        from one of the old fraternity houses, a white chair with the words &quot;Stoned 
        Clown&quot; emblazoned across the back. The chair makes an appearance 
        on the sideline of every game. At the end of the season, the captains 
        sign the chair and pass it down to the next generation along with other 
        memorabilia.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stoned Clown, with its combination of fierce competition and fun, is 
        agreed upon by many to be Bowdoin's most entertaining sports club. If 
        you still need a reason to attend a game, as Knapp put it, &quot;If nothing 
        else, our name is Stoned Clown.&quot;</p>
