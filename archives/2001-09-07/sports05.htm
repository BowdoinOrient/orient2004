      <p>There are some new developments visible in the Bowdoin athletic program 
        this fall, both inside and outdoors. Most noticeable is the Howard F. 
        Ryan Field, which is located behind Farley Field House. The Astroturf 
        playing field is currently being used for women's field hockey, and will 
        also house lacrosse in the spring. Additionally, Bowdoin's squash courts 
        are now situated next to the field house, in the new Lubin Family Squash 
        Center.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I think they (the new facilities) are wonderful,&quot; said Jeff 
        Ward, the College's athletic director. &quot;Good people did the work, 
        and they did a good job. In some senses, they exceeded my expectations.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both facilities were made possible by alumni gifts, and were officially 
        named and dedicated in the spring of 2000. The majority of the turf field's 
        funding came from H. Allen Ryan '64, in honor of his father, a member 
        of the class of '28. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Some people were worried about putting an artificial turf field 
        into the space,&quot; Ward said. &quot;But I don't think we have detracted 
        from it at all. That openness is still there, and I think later in the 
        fall it will be a gorgeous setting to play in.&quot;<br>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The Lubin family, as well as several other alumni and contributors, made 
        the new squash facility possible. Kate and Emily Lubin, both recent Bowdoin 
        graduates, were important in the conception of the building. Emily (Class 
        of '95) played tennis and squash while at the College, earning four-year 
        letters on both squads. Kate, who graduated last spring, also excelled 
        on the squash team during each of her four years.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There are six singles courts in the building, and one court that is adaptable 
        for both singles and doubles matches. &quot;Everything in there is very 
        simple, but it met every need we had,&quot; Ward said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The Lubin gift was a great one, and I believe it's the first time 
        where more than half the donation came from parents,&quot; Ward said. 
        &quot;There was a real community feel with the project.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ward is also pleased with the way the new facilities speak about the 
        College. &quot;When Bowdoin does things, we want to do them well, so that 
        our students have the opportunities they're looking for,&quot; he stated. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>He continued to signify that Ryan, the Lubin family, and the projects' 
        other contributors made important gifts to the school; ones that will 
        be utilized for many years to come. &quot;Both of these [projects] will 
        stand the test of time, as do many of our other facilities,&quot; he said.<br>
