        &quot;The morgue-that's what the students used to call this,&quot; said 
        librarian Sherrie Bergman, stepping into the basement of the Hawthorne-Longfellow 
        library. &quot;The lighting was abysmal,&quot; she clarified. However, 
        it is hard to think about cadavers when viewing the cheery glow of Bowdoin's 
        newly refurbished library. The completion of a $6.4 million renovation 
        has given Bowdoin's library more shelf space, up-to-date technology, and 
        has created a brighter and more comfortable atmosphere.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The renovations were designed by Ann Beha Architects of 
        Boston, and carried out by the H.P. Cummings Construction Company of Winthrop, 
        Maine.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the first floor, where high bookshelves and windowless 
        offices once bathed students in constant gloom, walls were knocked down 
        and stacks lowered to allow for better lighting. Lighter wood, new carpeting, 
        and more soft seating areas were added to create a warmer atmosphere.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The basement has also undergone a vast change, from improved 
        lighting and a soft furniture study area, to increased shelf space: the 
        result of newly installed compactable bookshelves.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="275" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/news05_library.jpg" width="275" height="186"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">A student-designed mural in the basement of H-L library. 
            (Chris Saunders, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The basement also boasts an improved electronic classroom, 
        doubled to seat 25 students at all new computers. A Bowdoin art class 
        also designed a brightly colored mural, which decorates one of the walls.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think what makes all the librarians so happy is 
        that students and faculty have this beautiful study space,&quot; said 
        Bergman. &quot;We're very happy that all the refurbishing is done and 
        the seating will be a lot more comfortable and attractive,&quot; continued 
        Bergman, &quot;and the lighting is also improved.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond its external face-lift, the library now has network 
        jacks at every seat, each connecting to a faster internet connection. 
        Additionally, the library benefits from 25 new PCs and 4 new Macs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Devices that will allow for wireless network connections 
        will be arriving around November along with more soft furniture for the 
        lounges and study areas.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hubbard Hall, the College's first freestanding library, 
        served from 1903 until 1965, which marked the completion of the Hawthorne-Longfellow 
        library. Hawthorne-Longfellow library was previously renovated in 1980, 
        when overcrowding forced the construction of an underground connection 
        to the Hubbard Hall stacks. The connector now houses the College's collection 
        of government documents.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Special Collections and Archives area also received 
        a face-lift during the recent renovations. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It's hard to tell you how depressing [the Special 
        Collections] was,&quot; said Bergman. &quot;It was pretty gloomy and unattractive.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Glass doors and panel-wood were added to bring in more light 
        and the office now has a spacious reception area. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In February, the archives will be rededicated in honor of 
        former U.S. Senator and Bowdoin alumnus George Mitchell. In 1994, Mitchell 
        donated numerous documents relating to his career to the archives.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for future plans, the Library committee's annual report 
        stated that despite an increase in shelf space, the library's most pressing 
        need was an off-site storage facility for about 100,000 volumes. The annual 
        report also emphasized a long-term need for more space as well as a higher 
        percentage increase to the library's annual budget.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A Challenge Match Grant from the National Endowment for 
        the Humanities provided funding for $2 million of the $6.4 million cost 
        of the renovation. Donations from Friends of the College, alumni, various 
        foundations, parents, and individuals supplied the rest.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">An open house on Friday, September 14, will be showcasing 
        the library's recent transformation. The event will take place between 
        12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m., featuring entertainment, refreshments, and tours 
        highlighting the library's recent improvements.</p>
