      <p>Talk about freaky. </p>
      <p>Three new servants join a lonely woman (Nicole Kidman) and her two photophobic 
        children in their isolated Victorian mansion. Soon after, ghostly intruders 
        begin terrorizing the household, and the mysteries ripen to a juicy plumpness. 
        Finally, a shocking conclusion throws the film into a whole new light. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>This film makes the viewer want to stay quietly slumped in his movie 
        seat for as long as possible in order to catch the next showing, even 
        if it means avoiding the awkward glances coming from that uniformed guy 
        sweeping the popcorn off the floor. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This is terror that is terribly good. This is The Others.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's the kind of movie that makes me shed tears of pride for the industry. 
        It makes me temporarily forgot about the money-sucking crap it has been 
        spitting out for most of the summer-crap that I've sat through only because 
        I got to see it for free (I worked at a movie theater&#133;good times). 
        I came out of The Others with a smile on my face that could not be wiped 
        off even by the sight of the frizzy, dyed red mullet on a guy walking 
        alongside me. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At random times during the day, I would even suddenly look up excitedly 
        and announce that I had discovered something cool about the movie (while 
        people around me probably wondered what I was on). However, I can't tell 
        you what any of those findings are! I can't spoil! No&#133; must&#133; 
        resist&#133; the temptation&#133;. <br>
        Anyway, Kidman was fabulously convincing as the edgy, disheveled Grace. 
        This role brought out a never-before-seen brilliance in her acting. All 
        soda-slurping eyes were set on her as she lead the new servants through 
        the house, almost killed her own child, and slowly sank into madness. 
        [Gossipy tidbit: Tom Cruise is this film's producer. That must have been 
        an awkward premiere&#133;.] <br>
      </p>
      <p>Oh, and Haley Joel Osment had better watch his back. Anakila Mann, who 
        plays Kidman's daughter, is a rising starlet (and she's got a cuter name&#133;). 
        Her portrayal of Grace's stubborn daughter reminds me all too well of 
        the too clever for her age little girl I used to baby-sit. A performance 
        powerful enough to bring back that long suppressed memory must be good. 
        Really good. <br>
        Director Alejandro Amenabar's influence is strewn throughout the film. 
        Watch for the play with shadows and the way he handles the darkness that 
        the story requires. The cinematography is truly breathtaking, a difficult 
        feat considering that the film takes place only in and immediately around 
        the house. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Others is the psychological thriller at its best. If you liked Silence 
        of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, or Scary Movie (that last one was a sick 
        joke--shame on you if you didn't catch it), you'll love this film. Go 
        see it. <br>
