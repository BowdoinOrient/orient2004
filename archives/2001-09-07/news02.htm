      <p>Jackhammers at 7 a.m., torn up sidewalks, and displaced students have 
        all characterized the college house renovations so far this semester. 
        The three foci of the renovations have been MacMillan House, Ladd House, 
        and Howell House with an emphasis placed upon the completion of Ladd House. 
        As Ladd students returned to their intended residence late August, they 
        were informed that their house was neither ready to move into nor would 
        be for at least a month. Furthermore, MacMillan house, the house the students 
        were to live in for the duration of the month, was not yet available for 
        occupancy. This left Residential Life with no option but to place students 
        in temporary rooms in Stowe Inn and Coles Tower. <br>
      </p>

            Orient</i></font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>According to Bob Graves, director of Residential Life, one of the major 
        reasons for the delays was the labor crunch in Maine.</p>
      <p> &quot;Right now, Maine has a tight construction market and contractors 
        and subcontractors had a hard time meeting deadlines due to the shortage 
        of labor,&quot; he explained. In fact, to step up the construction to 
        MacMillan House, construction workers were pulled from the Ladd House 
        project and reassigned to MacMillan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When asked about the students' response to the delays, Graves enthused 
        that &quot;students have been fantastic given the circumstances.&quot; 
        He noted that Residential Life changed plans on people a lot, but &quot;tried 
        to do the best that [they] could,&quot; and went on to cite their creative 
        decision to convert Howell's study into a bedroom. Graves specifically 
        praised Ladd for rallying together and making the best of an inconvenient 
        situation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The degree of renovation to the college houses has varied from minor 
        to dramatic. Howell House, originally slated to undergo renovations this 
        semester, will instead be revamped next semester, and its residents will 
        move to MacMillan House. After negotiations this summer, the house was 
        approved for occupancy without the requirement of an elevator, which translated 
        into less extensive construction. Ladd House and MacMillan house, two 
        former fraternities, have both undergone more significant alterations. 
        In Ladd, a kitchen for students was installed in addition to the commercial 
        kitchen already present; an elevator was also added for handicap access. 
        The house also now contains hardwood floors in both the living room and 
        the study. Both Ladd and MacMillan were rewired for a better internet 
        connection, and the heating system was upgraded. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Once the renovations to the college houses are finally completed, Bowdoin 
        will turn its eye to the possibility of additional social houses, as well 
        as the renovation of the first year dorms. <br>
