      <p>If you're looking for a member or coach of the Polar Bear football team 
        this fall, you may have a daunting task ahead of you. The team has dedicated 
        itself to putting in some long hours in hopes of improving upon last year's 
        disappointing 0-8 season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Numbers may be something of an issue, however. &quot;We have only 62 
        players in camp, with just over 50 of them healthy,&quot; Caputi said. 
        According to him, Bowdoin will have to employ more strategy than most 
        teams in the NESCAC this fall, because of this lack of players. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/sports05_football.jpg" width="300" height="182"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Tim McDonough '04 and James Salsich '03. (John Korstan 
            Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient) </i></font></td>

      </table>
      <p>Coach Caputi, in his second season at the helm of the squad, has been 
        stressing basic techniques and strategies thus far. He is counting on 
        a core of upperclassmen, featuring junior quarterback Justin Hardison, 
        defensive lineman Leroy Gaines '02, fullback Michael Taylor '02, and defensive 
        back Travis Cummings '02. He hopes that the three senior captains abd 
        Hardison will be able to both carry the team and teach younger players 
        as the season progresses.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This year's freshman class, according to Gaines, &quot;[Is] one of the 
        best recruited classes I've seen since I've been at Bowdoin. It all depends 
        on how hard they work, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of them play 
        a lot.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The rallying point thus far for this new class and group of returnings 
        has been that the team &quot;cannot overlook any little thing,&quot; said 
        Caputi. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The men must also avoid injuries both now and during the season to be 
        successful. In a sport where keeping players fresh is a high priorityt, 
        Bowdoin's small squad won't have the luxury of resting its key players. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Starting quarterback Hardison, who Caputi called &quot;a good athlete 
        who both runs and throws well,&quot; will have to rely not only on his 
        offensive line but also four first-year wideouts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The offensive line, led by right guard Mike Muhlholland '02, right tackles 
        Justin Foster '03 and Eric Morin '02 and sophomore center Bob Desaulniers, 
        are some of the returnees that have added physical strength through a 
        vigorous spring and summer lifting program. Players indicated that the 
        training helped to eliminate last season's &quot;bitter taste.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Gaines said that &quot;[the team's] goal was to regroup.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Last year was awkward from the start, as players, used to an old system, 
        rushed to adapt to Caputi's coaching style. Gaines went further, attributing 
        many of last season's problems not to this change of coaching but to the 
        team's mindset. &quot;We could have been a lot more successful last year 
        with better attitudes,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Gaines also stated that Caputi has been setting a positive example, &quot;bringing 
        a lot of enthusiasm to the team and having a great sense of the game.&quot; 
        <br>
        The football team opens its season on September 22 against Middlebury 
        at home. While everyone on the squad is eagerly anticipating the upcoming 
        games, Caputi said he knows that the team still has a long road ahead 
        of them. He has emphasized their &quot;need to show up for every minute 
        of every practice.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>With attention to detail and hard work, this year's edition of the Polar 
        Bear football team hopes they can once again bring Bowdoin back into the 
        upper eschalon of NESCAC football.<br>
