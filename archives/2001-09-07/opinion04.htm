      <p align="left">***ALL NAMES HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN THE INTEREST OF PARTIES 
        INVOLVED***</p>
      <p>It's the stuff that movies, books and songs are dedicated to but no one 
        can explain: the summer romance. What changes in those months when we're 
        not at school and everyone looks better because they're tan? What is it 
        about May, June, July and August (give or take a few weeks for post-season, 
        pre-season or orientation) that makes romance a little different than 
        the rest of the year? In short, I set out to learn WHAT HAPPENS TO BOWDOIN 
        STUDENTS' LOVE LIVES OVER THE SUMMER?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Well, there seem to be a handful of different scenarios that work themselves 
        out. Some Polar Bears find that upon release from the Bubble they may 
        take advantage of their freedom. &quot;I really find that over the summer 
        I tend to go a little wild,&quot; says Carrie, a sophomore. &quot;Bowdoin 
        is such a small community and I am usually really careful in respect to 
        that. But over the summer, it's like I want to get everything out of my 
        system because it's not my 'real' life at school.&quot; Many other students 
        I spoke to agree with Carrie. While we may all have chosen Bowdoin for 
        its desirable small class-size, we quickly learn that the social scene 
        may be equally as diminutive. Summer can be a time when all bets are off 
        and the unwritten rules we must abide by at school are no longer applicable. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Gunnar, also a sophomore, takes advantage of what he sees as a respite 
        from the dearth of dating material in Brunswick. &quot;Dude, the girls 
        are so hot in my town. I mean, if they all went to Bowdoin, then, like&#133;whoa&#133;&quot; 
        He is not the only one with this sentiment. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, other students may feel as if it's not really worth 
        it to put forth the effort when they only have a few months. Charlotte, 
        a sophomore, complains, &quot;Even if there is someone I like, it's not 
        like I'm eager to jump into a long-distance relationship. Why bother?&quot; 
        It seems that for Charlotte and many of her fellow students, Bowdoin's 
        relative isolation makes it very difficult to look forward to the prospects 
        of starting a serious relationship that then must be carried into the 
        coming year. Dave, a junior, agrees, &quot;I just like to have fun with 
        my buddies over the summer because I don't want to meet some really cool 
        chick and then have to be like, 'Peace, I'm going to Maine.' It's like 
        those couple of months don't really aren't worth any effort or anything.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>For another whole contingent, summer vacation means returning to your 
        high school romances and not having to put in as much effort. Many people 
        told me how much they look forward to summer because it means a break 
        from long-distance phone bills, rushing to get out an email while people 
        behind you wait to use the computer, having to whisper phone calls from 
        the H and L basement and trying to coordinate one's Spring Fling weekend 
        with another's exam schedule. All of a sudden there is all this free time 
        to spend with the person you care most about. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Not all students find this homecoming as comforting. Scott, a junior, 
        returned to his town, expecting to have everything go back to the way 
        it was. &quot;All year we would talk every night and be like, 'I love 
        you I miss you,' but when we got home it was like, not the same relationship 
        at all. We thought we had kept it together but we totally hadn't. Breaking 
        up was really difficult, especially after we had worked so hard all year 
        to stay together-I mean, neither of us had cheated or anything. But things 
        had just changed too much.&quot; [Note: I can testify to the fact that 
        Scott has not, in fact, ever cheated on his girlfriend. However, many 
        other friends of mine claim as well that they don't know why things are 
        different when they go home. Two words: open relationship]. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Lee, a sophomore, finds that even though he and his girlfriend broke 
        up before he left for his freshman year, whenever they go home, they wind 
        up back together. The combination of the same high school friends at the 
        same parties somehow leads him to forget that they are no longer in high 
        school and are no longer going out. (For more examples, see Kevin learn 
        to get over Tara Reid in the new American Pie 2). Moreover, Lee claims 
        that he is not happy in this arrangement, but cannot bring himself to 
        sever the ties. Students like him may not have fully taken advantage of 
        the opportunities Bowdoin offers to help him grow up and may, in fact, 
        regress when at home. That is, while our friend Lee complains that he 
        doesn't actually want to be with his [sometimes-ex-] girlfriend, he has 
        not yet discovered how to apply both the knowledge he should have learned 
        in the classroom and the confidence he should have learned on the field 
        to his personal life. Lee, I regret to inform you, is not alone.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So it seems to me that a Bowdoin student, upon release from this high-stress, 
        intensely tight-knit community, may find it hard to re-adjust to societal 
        norms over the summer. She may be tempted to act out and do what she feels 
        she cannot while at school. Or he may feel that when he leaves such a 
        demanding environment, it is just too tiring to do anything other than 
        what he did for the four years prior to Bowdoin. The only people who seem 
        to be able to maintain any sort of stability are those already in solid 
        relationships. Perhaps it is because they have already struck a balance 
        between school and romance during the year so it is much easier for them 
        to adjust. Unattached students have not yet learned how to find such equilibrium 
        and thus the elimination of school-related pressure can cause a drastic 
        swing in either direction. Students who are not quite involved and not 
        quite single generally find that they are confused and often wind up in 
        situations that make them unhappy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>That said, here we are, back at Bowdoin, for a new year with many new 
        possibilities. Summer is over and who knows what lies ahead for Polar 
        Bears, single, attached or somewhere in between? We have a fresh start 
        with fresh perspectives and freshmen. Allow me to quote Gunnar, when he 
        said, &quot;Dude, I am just so glad to be back.&quot; Thanks, Gunn-o; 
        so are we all.</p>
