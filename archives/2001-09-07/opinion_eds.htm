      <p align="left"><font size="4"><a name="eds01"></a>Bowdoin in transition</font></p>
      <p align="left">It is undoubtedly true that Bowdoin is in a state of transition. 
        Perhaps the most obvious indication of this is the College's change in 
        presidents. No two presidents are the same, and Bowdoin will certainly 
        see changes during the shift from the Robert Edwards reign to that of 
        President Barry Mills.<br>
        But the presidential change is just one of the many signs of transition. 
        The hiring of Jim Miller, the new Dean of Admissions, roughly coincides 
        with the overhauling of two other admissions tools: the viewbook and the 
        College's website. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last year's viewbook redevelopment has clearly impacted 
        the type of student who applies to Bowdoin. The current viewbook is a 
        radical change from the previous edition, and students attracted to the 
        current viewbook may very well be radically different from the students 
        attracted to the previous viewbook. <br>
        This year's redevelopment of the College website is also likely to attract 
        a different breed of student (some might say of the Abercrombie persuasion). 
        The students attracted to the many and varied muted colors, the noticeably 
        rectangular menu options, and, at first glance, the seemingly blank homepage 
        of the current website are probably quite different from the students 
        attracted to the more classical true blue of the old site.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With such a change in the student body, other changes must 
        come as well. New faculty members must be recruited to keep up with the 
        new interests of the students. Extracurricular activities and programs 
        must conform to the varied pursuits of the students, and even the housing 
        system and the various academic requirements must inevitably undergo some 
        changes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The result is that as new and different students matriculate 
        and graduate, the composition of the Bowdoin community will change, and 
        even the College itself will change.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, the College has already changed. The Bowdoin of 
        today is not at all the Bowdoin of even five years ago. And the question 
        is not whether this is for better or for worse; the question is how the 
        students of five years ago, or even of fifty years ago, can relate to 
        the College of today.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College should keep in mind that as things change, connections 
        are broken. But it is fundamentally important for graduates and students 
        of all generations to feel a personal connection to the College, because 
        that connection is far more important than the degree. But if we lose 
        that connection to Bowdoin, then little is left but a piece of paper.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"><a name="eds02"></a>Flexible to a fault</font></p>
      <p align="left">The College House System is said to be many things by many 
        observers. For some, the collection of residences provides Bowdoin's most 
        lively social scene; for others, it is a timid substitute for the Greek 
        system. But the college houses should never accused of being brittle. 
        This fall's extended game of musical chairs, being played by once, current 
        or future residents and affiliates of Howell, Burnett, Ladd, and MacMillan 
        Houses, shows just how flexible the house system and its members are. 
      </p>
      <p>The saga of last year's Howell and Burnett Houses is difficult to describe 
        in one breath. Howell House (formerly Howard Hall) residents were intended 
        to occupy MacMillan House (formerly TD) while Howell was brought to fire 
        code, a renovation which would have been completed during the coming winter 
        break. Ladd House- last year's Burnett- was supposed to move into the 
        old Chi Delt building this fall. Due to delays and difficulties, Howell 
        stayed put this semester, and Ladd residents wait it out in MacMillan 
        while waiting for the Ladd renovations to be completed. Helmrich House's 
        plans to occupy MacMillan in the spring semester are now on hold, since 
        Howell's residents will be placed there in order to make room for renovations 
        to Howell itself. For those three social houses, the ground is shifting 
        under their feet.</p>
      <p>It is an impressive feat of flexibility that the social houses have continued 
        to function normally amidst all this chaos, but it is also unnerving. 
        The 1997 report from the Commission on Residential Life which shaped the 
        current house system deplored the &quot;many pressures of fragmentation&quot; 
        on campus, noting that &quot;students move from one residence to the next 
        over four years at Bowdoin with little continuity in relationships with 
        diverse groups of students.&quot; It was certainly unanticipated that 
        the members of the proposed social houses themselves would, almost 5 years 
        later, still be trading campus residences each semester with such little 
        continuity as they currently are. Residential Life has been diplomatic 
        in dealing with the house leaderships, but the College could have performed 
        better oversight of the construction projects, ameliorating the pinched 
        schedules and hurt feelings.</p>
      <p>&quot;We envision the possibility&quot;, wrote the Commission, &quot;that 
        over time, each of these Houses will develop a distinctive tradition and 
        identity connecting students across class years and to the College. A 
        small library or display case in each house might collect memorabilia 
        about the House&#133;&quot; Constant mobility, though, makes this kind 
        of planned nostalgia difficult to stick. The social houses are still very 
        young, and so far they have had a rough and tumble upbringing- not economically 
        but emotionally. The College should make it a priority to allow its social 
        houses to really take root. </p>
