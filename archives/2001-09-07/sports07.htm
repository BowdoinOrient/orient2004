      <p>Forget the football team, the field hockey team, and the soccer team, 
        because it's time to watch women's volleyball. This year, Bowdoin volleyball 
        has a new head coach, a talented assistant, and experienced players, creating 
        an equation for an exciting season. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Armed with experience and enthusiasm, Kellie Bearman has taken control 
        of the Bowdoin Women's Volleyball Team. She possesses years of experience 
        as both a scholarship player at Ambassador University in Texas and as 
        a teacher of the game at Attleboro (Massachusetts) High School. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bearman replaced Lynn Ruddy, who had coached the team since its creation 
        in 1986. Under Ruddy, the 2000 squad finished with an 11-23 record and 
        a tenth-place finish in the NESCAC tournament.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To improve upon its past successes, the team plans to focus on improving 
        communication and winning at least half of its conference matches, as 
        well as all of its games outside NESCAC. The women believe that achieving 
        these goals will help the team on their path to a NESCAC championship. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The players have set their aim high, and Coach Bearman believes they 
        can accomplish what they desire. &quot;They have done everything that 
        I've asked them to do,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actual numbers may be the only factor that stands in the way of their 
        success. In volleyball, six people play at a time. The Bowdoin 2001 roster 
        team has only eight names on its roster, and as a result, each player 
        must fully develop their all-around game and learn new positions to ensure 
        the success of the team.<br>
        Potential injuries are another concern for the women, and the entire squad 
        is constantly conscious of their physical well-being. Assistant coach 
        Brian Steele, who is also an emergency medical technician, assists the 
        players in their efforts to stay healthy. Coach Steele has extensive experience 
        in volleyball as well, playing for several years as a setter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This year's team is lead by captains Lindsay Davis '02 and Mara Caruso 
        '03. Returning players include juniors Becca Geehr and Jess Reuben, and 
        sophomores Bryony Heise, Erin Phillipson, and Ina Hoxha. The team's lone 
        freshman is Benedicta Doe.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Davis provides the team with solid experience at net. Heise is taking 
        on the role of setter this year, and is responding to the challenge with 
        the attitude and mindset of a veteran. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Phillipson, a defensive specialist, is the best passer on the team and 
        provides a solid foundation for the squad's offensive attacks. Geehr and 
        Reuben bring their experience from last year to the hitting and blocking 
        typical of front-row action. Doe, a natural athlete with raw talent for 
        volleyball, is expected to make important contributions to the team. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Caruso believes that the nature of the sport, compounded with the small 
        size of the team, will &quot;put pressure on each girl to know that the 
        way she plays individually can make or break a game.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This necessity to perform does not overly concern the team members, according 
        to Caruso, because their &quot;relationship off the court undoubtedly 
        helps our chemistry in a match.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coach Bearman states that &quot;if volleyball is played well, it is a 
        beautiful sport to watch.&quot; The Bowdoin Women's Volleyball Team plans 
        to make it a season of beauty.<br>
