      <p align="left"><br>
        On an island where &quot;Liberal Arts&quot; may be a cover-label for &quot;not 
        really knowing what to do with yourself,&quot; there exists a saving grace 
        whose primary virtue is helping student make the transition into the work 
        world. The Bowdoin Career Planning Center (CPC), on the first floor of 
        Moulton Union, thrives on providing Bowdoin students with the knowledge 
        they need in order to establish themselves in a competitive world. It 
        is the kind of place where you, in dire cluelessness, can walk in and 
        find an array of brochures.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond brochures and paper, the CPC offers career counseling 
        for people of all levels 1)you just came in and don't know what to do, 
        2)you called for an appointment to explore summer internships, 3)you simply 
        want to revel in the fact that you got a new job. This year their services 
        include counseling for summer internships, permanent jobs, local jobs, 
        grants and fellowships. Finding something that in some way jives with 
        your major can be a real challenge. The CPC offers career guidance in 
        many areas including arts, business, sciences, pre-law, education, pre-med, 
        and, of course, important decisions about graduate school. Gladly, all 
        counselors are available to help in all areas, though some will have specific 
        focuses.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anne Shields, Director of Career Planning, realizes the 
        journey of pursuit is not easy. However, with intention and effort, the 
        journey becomes a little easier. &quot;We are here to help students find 
        what is out there,&quot; Anne said. &quot;14 years of school make it hard 
        to know what is really out in the work world.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the CPC's statistics, about 82% of students 
        use their services before their senior year. To further this effort, this 
        year the CPC has launched two new projects. One involves the internet, 
        EBear. EBear (<a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/cpc">www.bowdoin.edu/cpc</a>) 
        permits you to set a profile of yourself, thus giving the CPC your perimeters 
        of interest. Thereafter, they may contact you about new jobs and opportunities.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an environment where personal interests shift like the 
        Maine weather, setting future perimeters is quite easy. According to Shields, 
        55% of first-years have already registered with EBear. Smiling, first 
        year Timothy Ballenger tells the Orient that he is excited about not having 
        to focus too much on internships for the coming summer. &quot;The CPC 
        just makes it easy for you.&quot; Ballenger plans to focus on his academics 
        with the knowledge that the CPC will support his internship search. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another exciting, and rather interpersonal feature, the 
        CPC has launched is its Peer Career Advising (PCA) program. According 
        to junior Cabul Mehta, is a &quot;liaison between students on campus and 
        adults at CPC.&quot; One of this year's four PCAs, Mehta expressed excitement 
        in using his interpersonal skills to relate to and help students that 
        may not be comfortable talking with &quot;adults&quot; about their future 
        career plans.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The CPC staff's advising is a result of thorough trainings 
        in r&eacute;sum&eacute; preparation, internship and job searches, pursuing 
        majors, etc.&#133; &quot;We are a bridge,&quot; Mehta states. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Along with the rest of the CPC, he believes that this new 
        youthful guidance will help this year's students find their path to a 
        successful and fulfilling life after Bowdoin.<br>
