      <p>President Barry Mills is not interested in talking about the past. He 
        wants to talk about now, about how great he believes Bowdoin is, and about 
        how he intends to make it better. As a self-proclaimed optimist, he prefers 
        not to look at Bowdoin in terms of what's wrong with it, but in terms 
        of how it can get better.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Where we are is an incredibly wonderful place with solid roots,&quot; 
        Mills said. &quot;We are stable financially, we have a wonderful curriculum, 
        a wonderful faculty, great students, the house system.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Still, he recognizes that Bowdoin is in a transitional state, and that 
        this presents a challenge to the campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Bowdoin is not all that different from the rest of the world,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;People are, in all walks of life, questioning things. Things 
        are changing very quickly in our society, and things are changing very 
        quickly here.&quot;<br>

          <td background="../standard_images/graybox.gif"> 
            <p><font size="2">Barry Mills, 50, was elected the 14th president 
              of Bowdoin College by the College's Board of Trustees on January 
              9, 2001. He began his new post on July 1, 2001. <br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">A member of the Bowdoin College Class of 1972, Mills 
              is the fifth alumnus to be elected president of the College. Mills, 
              who holds a doctorate in biology, also holds a law degree. He formerly 
              served as the deputy presiding partner of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton 
              in New York City, one of the nation's preeminent international law 
              firms. He joined the firm in 1979 and became a partner in 1986.<br>
              Born in Providence, Rhode Island, on September 8, 1950, Mills graduated 
              in 1968 from Pilgrim High School in Warwick, Rhode Island. <br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">A Dean's List student at Bowdoin, Mills graduated 
              cum laude in 1972 with a double major in biochemistry and government. 
              He earned his doctorate in biology in 1976 at Syracuse University, 
              where he taught courses as a graduate student in introductory biology, 
              cell physiology, and animal physiology. He earned his law degree 
              at the Columbia University School of Law in 1979, where he was a 
              Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. Mills has published papers in the field 
              of biology and, as a lawyer, has produced numerous publications 
              and speeches in his field. He was also a leader in the in-house 
              continuing legal education program at Debevoise &amp; Plimpton.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Mills is married to Karen Gordon Mills, a founder 
              and managing director of Solera Capital, LLC, a private equity firm 
              located in New York City. She will continue to spend several days 
              a week working in New York. As a student at Radcliffe College, Karen 
              Mills was president of the Harvard Dramatic Club. She graduated 
              magna cum laude from Radcliffe in 1975 with a degree in economics 
              and earned her MBA at the Harvard Business School in 1977. She is 
              currently a member of the Harvard University Board of Overseers.

              from 1994 until 2000. He has served as chair of the Board's Student 
              Affairs Committee and as a member of the Academic Affairs Committee. 
              He follows Samuel Harris (1867-71), Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain

      <p>He acknowledges the &quot;enormous strides&quot; that Bowdoin made under 
        the Edwards Administration, but he wants to focus only on how he can build 
        on them. Most notable to him is the College House System, which Mills 
        sees as the &quot;crowning glory&quot; of Edwards's time at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills makes it clear that he wants to build on efforts that have been 
        well under way, such as making Bowdoin more diverse, improving gender 
        equity, thinking about </p>
      <p>curriculum reform, and increasing a sense of community.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, he is also quick to point out that he has yet to define his 
        goals and priorities for Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I think it's too soon,&quot; he said. Instead of enumerating a 
        list, Mills is doing a lot of listening, &quot;spending a good deal of 
        time getting a sense of the place.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills spent the summer meeting one-on-one with faculty members, and he 
        continues to do so. He said he has found the faculty to be incredibly 
        optimistic about the future.<br>
      </p>
      <p>He held his first official office hours this past Tuesday, from noon 
        to 2:00 p.m., in the Smith Union. He will have these office hours each 
        week, and highly encourages all students to visit with him.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's important for Bowdoin-and it's important for me-to get the 
        viewpoints from many different kinds of people, to have a diverse group 
        of people advising the people who are running the College,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In order to gain more perspectives, he has restructured the meetings 
        of the senior administrators, to make them more open to other members 
        of the staff. College decisions are no longer made by the &quot;senior 
        staff,&quot; but instead by the &quot;College Coordinating Group,&quot; 
        which is a more inclusive body. This is one way he has tried to make the 
        Administration more accessible and sensitive to diversity.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills believes that Bowdoin is now wholly committed to improving its 
        diversity, though he stressed that one of his primary concerns is making 
        sure everyone thinks hard about what it means to be diverse.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills emphasized that, despite the economic slump, Bowdoin will remain 
        &quot;totally devoted to need-blind admissions&quot; and to &quot;making 
        Bowdoin accessible to people from all socioeconomic backgrounds.&quot; 
        Mills himself was a financial aid recipient for three of his years here, 
        and recognizes that it is extremely important to meet the financial needs 
        of all students as the College aims to bring in more diversity.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Bringing people here is only the first step,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
        just the first step, and in many ways, the easiest step. Now we have to 
        create a culture and programs that really are accepting and understanding 
        for the different kinds of people that are going to be here.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;You can't just snap your fingers and say, 'do that'.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The &quot;growing pains&quot; associated with the transition to a more 
        pluralistic campus, he said, will be significant, and will present a challenge 
        to students. &quot;It's not good to have people here who are having a 
        terrible experience, but to have an edge-to have some experience here-that 
        may be good. This can't be four years of Pleasantville.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He sees the College House System as the defining social characteristic 
        of Bowdoin and believes it will be instrumental in ensuring an open, pluralistic 
        campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Though Mills was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity while at 
        Bowdoin, he cannot over-emphasize his enthusiasm for the House System 
        and its benefits over the former fraternity system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike the fraternity system, Mills believes that the house system must 
        not be based on self-selection or exclusion.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Acknowledging the discomforts of a non-selective system, he said, &quot;It 
        doesn't strike me as surprising that, as people spend more time here, 
        they will meet people they like and will want to form their own communities.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He continued, &quot;It's not unnatural. It's just not the experience, 
        at this point, that we think people should have.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The College House System &quot;is not the way people lived before coming 
        to Bowdoin, and it's probably not the way they're going to live when they 
        leave Bowdoin.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Residential liberal arts colleges are in some ways incredibly unique 
        experiences. Never again will it happen where you come to a place and 
        you don't get to choose your neighbors. Live as a community. Open yourselves 
        up to different kinds of people and make yourselves available to them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He said he expects the house system to evolve while always maintaining 
        its principle of openness, but he strongly feels that it will work.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Noting that the building boom that started in the '90s is nearing completion, 
        Mills said that the level of construction in the next five years will 
        be significantly less than what it was in the past ten years. Bowdoin 
        will continue with its plans to build a new academic building, to turn 
        Curtis Pool into a recital hall, and to renovate the Walker Art Museum.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Beyond that, he said, &quot;I'm not, at this point, looking at a huge 
        amount of construction.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He also does not believe it is the right time to grow the size of the 
        student body, partly because of the expense. &quot;We have recognized 
        that growing the College is incredibly expensive, and I think that it's 
        time for us to focus on curriculum, faculty resources, financial aid.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills is most interested in ensuring that Bowdoin is academically alive, 
        &quot;with all sorts of intellectual ideas bouncing off the walls.&quot; 
        With this in mind, he wants to strengthen the academic program and reevaluate 
        the curriculum, noting that many faculty members want to expand interdisciplinary 
        coursework, change the distribution requirements, and add a senior capstone 
        experience.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, he wants to make sure that the faculty members themselves make 
        all curricular decisions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I hope the faculty together with the deans will tell me what they 
        really believe is necessary for there to be a wonderful program on this 
        campus, and my job will be to help them achieve that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In line with this goal, he wants to re-examine the budgetary expectations 
        for faculty expansion within the coming years. The faculty has seen a 
        rapid expansion in the recent past, necessary to accommodate the larger 
        student body. Projected budgets for the future, however, do not suggest 
        the same kind of growth for the faculty.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;That makes me uncomfortable, because, for Bowdoin to be dynamic 
        and to grow, we need to have a dynamic faculty. The faculty needs to feel 
        that it has the support, that we provide the capacity for the curriculum 
        to grow.<br>
        &quot;I am very hopeful that the faculty will grow.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills recognizes that there are pressures and risks in the liberal arts 
        sector, many financial, but he doesn't believe they pose a great problem 
        at Bowdoin.<br>
        &quot;There is undoubtedly an arms race,&quot; he said, which puts financial 
        stress on the College when it has to compete with other more endowed colleges.<br>

      </table>
      <p>He looks at the arms race realistically, though. &quot;Over the long 
        haul, you can't be all things to all people,&quot; he said. &quot;What 
        we have to do is decide what we want to be, and be that. You have to make 
        some choices.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Such choices were needed in the Mills household as well. Barry and his 
        wife, Karen Gordon Mills, have three boys: William, 15, Henry, 12, and 
        George, 8.<br>
        Karen continues to run an active business in New York, and spends several 
        days a week there. &quot;I think Karen will be involved in the life of 
        this campus, but I don't think she'll have, at least at this point, any 
        formal role on committees.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The move from New York City to Maine has required quite a bit of adjustment 
        for the family.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I loved living in New York. I love being here, too, but I wasn't 
        trying to escape New York. It's going to be a tough adjustment for the 
        boys,&quot; he said, &quot;especially the older ones.&quot;<br>
