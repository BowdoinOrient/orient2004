      <p>Visiting artist Patrick Doughery will be adding a unique centerpiece 
        to Bowdoin's campus throughout the month of September. Dougherty will 
        work on the quad for three weeks to create a massive, free-standing sculpture, 
        composed of hundreds of intertwined branches and saplings in front of 
        Searles Hall. </p>
      <p>&quot;In the course of three weeks there will be a type of evolution,&quot; 
        explained Curatorial Assistant Caitlin Nelson of the Walker Art Museum, 
        which sponsored Dougherty's work. </p>
      <p> &quot;[Walker Art Museum Curator] Allison Ferris has been working to 
        get Mr. Dougherty here for 5 or 6 years,&quot; says Nelson. &quot;We originally 
        scheduled him to come now because the museum was to be under renovations 
        . . . and we wanted to still be able to display something outdoors while 
        the indoor displays were closed.&quot; Renovations, which will keep the 
        art museum closed, were slated to begin this semester, but now will commence 
        next summer. </p>
      <p>Nelson noted that there has already been a large student response to 
        this, and expects the anticipation to build throughout the coming weeks. 
        &quot;We expect [the sculpture] to generate a lot more excitement from 
        the students . . . when they watch a pile of sticks become an impressive 
        sculpture,&quot; added Nelson.<br>
        And impressive it will be. Dougherty's sculptures, which have been erected 
        everywhere from California to Japan over his 19 year career, often tower 
        over 20 feet tall. In addition, the only tools he works with are simple 
        clippers, and he forgoes any string or wire that could help stabilize 
        his huge and winding structures. </p>
      <p>&quot;The natural spring and tension of the branches holds them together,&quot; 
        the artist explained. &quot;I begin by placing sticks in the ground, which 
        act as the initial matrix from which I pull branches through, sort of 
        a layering effect, and then go back to make it look like a feeling, adding 
        spirals and designs in the branches.&quot; </p>
      <p>During his three weeks here, Dougherty will be assisted by both art students 
        and general volunteers in everything from the &quot;harvesting&quot;, 
        or gathering of materials when he first arrives, to the finishing touches 
        on the day he leaves. </p>
      <p>As for what we can expect from Dougherty, it remains to be seen. &quot;I 
        have some initial ideas. I made a site visit [in April],&quot; Dougherty 
        said, &quot;but I don't have set blueprints. I'll begin with some type 
        of initial framework and then, once I get a feeling for architecture and 
        the area, we'll see where things go.&quot;</p>
        
      <p>Dougherty's career began in his home state of North Carolina in 1982 
        and he quickly began exploring his unique medium. Explaining why he chooses 
        to work with wood rather than more conventional materials, the artist 
        explained that &quot;some things just develop - when you work, you feel 
        a natural affinity for some materials over others. The saplings are from 
        nature, and it lives with which you draw, and the extension is interesting.</p>
      <p> He noted that a large source of enjoyment in his work was his ability 
        to meet many interesting people. </p>
      <p> &quot;A big point of interest in my work, too, is that I meet a lot 
        of people while I work and get to discuss things of importance to me, 
        such as people's feelings about space and sculpture, which often leads 
        to stories about themselves. My work might remind someone of their grandfather's 
        farm, or of a lilac bush from their childhood, and hearing people's stories 
        influences my work as I get tremendous feedback about how my work makes 
        people feel and what they like and don't like. It's always a tremendous 
        experience.&quot; </p>
      <p>Once the sculpture is finished, it will be kept up until the fall, when 
        it will be disassembled. There will be an opening reception at the Walker 
        Art Museum on September 28 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., after which Dougherty 
        will speak about his life and his work. Students interested in learning 
        more information should contact the Walker Art Museum 725-3275 or visit 
        Dougherty's website at <a href="http://www.stickwork.net">www.stickwork.net</a>.<br>
