      <p align="left">Bowdoin College announced plans to purchase the Stowe House 
        and Inn, a historic inn in downtown Brunswick. Maintaining the existing 
        appearance of the house, the College would use the inn section of the 
        structure for student housing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Housing Bowdoin students at the Stowe Inn is not a new idea. 
        As explained by Scott Hood, Associate Vice President/Director of Communications 
        and Public Affairs beginning in the spring of 1999 and then again in the 
        spring of 2000, when Bowdoin had more students who requested on-campus 
        housing then was available, Bowdoin leased some rooms in the Stowe Inn. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The bed shortage and the decision to purchase the Stowe 
        Inn is a function of the current period residential life transition at 
        Bowdoin. As Bowdoin Vice President for Planning and Development at William 
        Torrey said, &quot;Essentially it is recognizing [that] with the renovations 
        of fraternities and dorms we are about 50-60 beds short.&quot; Bob Graves, 
        Director of Residential Life, stated, &quot;Demand [for off campus housing] 
        has dried up.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hood explained that the college has leased the property 
        for the 2001 fall semester, as it has done in some past semesters, in 
        order to deal with the short-term problem of the current semester. This 
        year, however, the college also looked into the purchase alternative for 
        the future and &quot;approached the owners earlier this semester&quot; 
        said Hood.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although there is a formal offer from the College for the 
        purchase of the Stowe Inn (the price is not yet public), Bowdoin &quot;won't 
        buy it unless the town approves changes to the zoning,&quot; added Hood. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The zoning issues concern the uses that are allowed on the 
        property according to town ordinances. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Brunswick Town Planner Theo Holtwijk said &quot;the majority 
        of the property is TR-2 (Town Residential 2),&quot; which means it is 
        used for mostly single-family homes. Holtwijk added that the college would 
        like the zoning changed to Cu-4 (College Use 4), which is &quot;more geared 
        towards the needs of the college.&quot; Cu-4 zoning would allow the property 
        to be used for college offices, museums, and residence halls.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order for requested the changes to be implemented, either 
        Brunswick's zoning ordinance would need to allow for college residence 
        halls or an amendment would be need to be made to the Stowe Inn's specific 
        lot.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On August 29, a neighborhood meeting was held to give local 
        residents a chance to ask questions and hear from representatives of the 
        Brunswick town government and Bowdoin College. Hood described &quot;people 
        there [as] really supportive.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It wasn't only the college officials who were feeling optimistic 
        about the town's reaction. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Holtwijk said, &quot;People don't want to see Federal St. 
        change; they don't want to see professional buildings up and down street. 
        The neighbors say [that] the college has done a good job of maintaining 
        properties.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There were, however, some concerns from residents. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;They mainly concerned 'what ifs,' such as, 'What if 
        the college wanted to knock down a building?'&quot; explained Hood, who 
        also emphasized that &quot;even if they [Bowdoin] did want to, there would 
        need to be a process.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although Hood also noted that there were a few concerns 
        about the potential for misbehavior of Bowdoin students who live at the 
        Stowe House, he added that many residents praised the resident students 
        for their behavior.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Holtwijk said &quot;a number of neighbors [commented on 
        how] incredibly well behaved the students have been.&quot; Torrey said, 
        &quot;presuming [the sale] goes through, [it will be] largely because 
        students have been so good. Neighbors say it is a pleasure. If students 
        had not been so good [Bowdoin] would never have been able to do it. &quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Torrey also said &quot;I think our relationship with the 
        town is very good at the moment, a very mutual respect. We will pay taxes 
        to the town on the Stowe property.&quot; Because of the college's tax-exempt 
        status, most of the currently owned college property is largely tax exempt.
