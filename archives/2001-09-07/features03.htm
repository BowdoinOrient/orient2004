      <p align="left"><i><font size="2">The first in a series of articles by a 
        former Bowdoin student currently residing in China</font></i><br>
      </p>
      <p>It's 6:30 in the morning and all I want is another half-hour of sleep 
        before I have to get up to teach my first day of classes at the Tanghu 
        Middle School, a Communist Party boarding school in Shuang Liu, China. 
        I toss over on my hard Chinese mattress, but something is keeping me up. 
        As I start to gain conscious I realize what that something is. It's The 
        Beatles. Someone is playing &quot;Hey Jude&quot; extraordinarily loud. 
        Its not my roommates. Alex is still sleeping and Kevin has already gotten 
        up and left. The music, it turns out, blares out of the Tanghu School's 
        numerous loudspeakers. The students, along with half the neighborhood, 
        are being woken up for the day.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Hey Jude&quot; comes to an end, but it is replaced by the impatient 
        voice of a man barking out commands. I only speak a few words of Mandarin, 
        but I can tell from his tone that he is not a happy camper. He snaps and 
        snarls for about 30 minutes, but by the time I have jogged the half a 
        block to the school to investigate what is going on the loudspeakers have 
        been turned off and the students are milling around quietly as though 
        nothing unusual has happened.<br>
        I eat breakfast, which this morning consists of soy milk, a hard boiled 
        egg, and a steamed pork bun. Pork is a healthy part of every well balanced 
        meal in China. Two weeks ago I was a confirmed vegetarian. Since I arrived 
        here I have had pork at least three times a day. If there was a way to 
        drink pork I am sure I would have been introduced to it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I spend the next couple of hours in my office, reviewing my lesson plans 
        and then beginning the Virginia Woolf novel that I brought with me. Just 
        as Virginia and I are really starting to get acquainted, the same Mandarin 
        voice from this morning starts booming out commands over the loudspeakers. 
        I drop my book, run down the stairs in the direction of the raucous and 
        come to the end of a hallway that overlooks the school's soccer field. 
        There, lined up in geometrically perfect lines, is the entire student 
        body of over 3000 children. <br>
        The head gym teacher stands with a microphone on a platform at one side 
        of the field. As I watch, he orders them to move around into different 
        formations. Coaches and teachers circulate through the lines of students, 
        berating the ones that fall out of place. My first impression is one of 
        ethnocentric disgust. &quot;How can little kids be forced to march like 
        soldiers, and how dare those teachers manhandle the children.&quot; During 
        college I was fascinated and enthusiastic about Communism, but I can already 
        feel my once high opinion of Marx going down the drain. One of the female 
        gym teachers goes nuts because a 12 year old boy was talking to his neighbor. 
        She is screaming, her face inches away from his, and I can see that the 
        little boy is petrified. I want to go over there and give her a piece 
        of my American mind. But I don't.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There is a brilliant documentary on the Vietnam War called Hearts and 
        Minds. Throughout the movie, spliced into scenes of villages burning and 
        American soldiers marching, are shots of an American high school football 
        game. The players act like they are going into battle, and the coaches 
        scream at them as though they were their commanding officers. Later in 
        the day, when I am alone again in my office, I remember the documentary, 
        and all of the other times I have seen American teachers and coaches (and 
        parents) treat their children as though they were soldiers. I may be on 
        the other side of the earth, but lots of things about life here feel eerily 
        familiar.</p>
