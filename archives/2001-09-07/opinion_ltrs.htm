        Houses</font></b><a name="ltrs01"></a></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an issue last spring, you examined some aspects of the 
        House System. This is an important step, because this year the remnants 
        of the previous fraternity system have faded and the new arrangement has 
        full responsibility for undergraduate life. The patterns established this 
        year can have a long term effect in setting new traditons.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Originally the Houses (the term used in those days) included 
        essentially the entire student body with each House a typical cross-section 
        of the campus. As you know, the fraternities arose because the College 
        provided neither dining service nor a social setting. Unfortunately the 
        former system could not evolve into an equivalent of the present system, 
        because it was caught between a vocal group of alumni elders blocking 
        any change and an equally vocal group of newer faculty to whom the term 
        &quot;fraternity&quot; equaled &quot;discrimination&quot;. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In setting up this new House System, the Trustees wanted 
        to enhance the sense of community by providing more student participation 
        in this social environment. Many Trustees recalled the conviviality that 
        the Houses had back then, and hoped this would restore some of that.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For many years I was Faculty Advisor to one of the Houses. 
        And I have watched the changes in campus demography for many years. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When I first joined the faculty, the seniors essentially 
        ran campus life. As the seniors became more and more interested in their 
        major program and their post-graduate careers, their interest in leadership 
        diminished, yet they were unwilling to pass that role on to the juniors. 
        Now seniors mostly live off campus, juniors study away, and much of the 
        campus activities are left to the two lower classes. I do hope that somehow 
        the upper classes will become involved in House activities to provide 
        more continuity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now, for what it is worth, I will suggest some items for 
        consideration which may help the new system fulfill its intent. Some of 
        these are a reinvention of former activities.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">1. The incoming class needs to be integrated into campus 
        life as rapidly as possible. The present segregation of the new students 
        was necessary when there was insufficient campus housing for all students. 
        Now with much more extensive space on campus, a cross-section of classes 
        in each major living space will be an advantage. Transitions, as always, 
        can upset some, but I suggest that proctors should be juniors and seniors 
        and that rising sophomores have a choice of rooms before rising juniors. 
        At one time students wishing to retain the same room for the following 
        year had first choice.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">2. One way to establish a sense of House interaction was 
        to have meals together. Now with the extended cafeteria, that is now impossible. 
        However, in the dining hall perhaps one table could be reserved for each 
        House so that members could meet less randomly.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">3. At one time there was an Inter-Fraternity Council to 
        coordinate a wide variety of activity, one of which was House Parties. 
        If this is reinvented as an Inter-House Council, I suggest that it be 
        composed of two members from each House, one sophomore and one junior 
        or senior. Elections need to be early enough in the spring so that the 
        new Council will have time to organize fall activities.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">4. Earlier that was an extensive inter-fraternity sports 
        program. These activites were coordinated and supervised by a group called 
        White Key. They arranged schedules and provided needed referees. Also 
        in conjunction with the Athletic Department, they acted as campus hosts 
        for visiting teams. Inter-house sports can be a way to enhance House activities 
        and interest.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">5. When I was Faculty Advisor, each House had at least one 
        advisor. The advisors usually joined the House for dinner once a week. 
        The role of Advisor was never clearly defined. The house officers would 
        often discuss various issues with me. As a faculty member (and elder) 
        I could help to provide some perspective and continuity. Also, I was not 
        &quot;official&quot; like a dean. Perhaps each house could persuade a 
        faculty member to be a House Advisor. (If the students like this idea, 
        then the position could a credit like a committee member for Faculty Affairs.) 
        Also the houses would have a Guest Night, and invite two or three faculty 
        and spouses to join them for dinner and conversation afterward. Obviously 
        such an event now will require special arrangement with Dining Service, 
        but it remains a possibility. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">6. House meetings are an important function. This is probably 
        the only time when a majority of the members would be together. Scheduling 
        now is increasingly difficult. Perhaps one or two of the Common Hours 
        each term could be a suitable time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">7. House membership. I think that the intent of the Trustees 
        was that each House should be a cross-section of the student body. Thus 
        it is best to have the incoming class assigned &quot;at ransom&quot; to 
        use a favorite malapropism of Jack Magee.</p>

      <p align="left">To the Editors:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I strongly believe that a significant difference can be 
        made by conservation, efficiency and sustainable technology. At Bowdoin, 
        while we still rely on coal and oil for electricity and heating, we, as 
        students, professors and staff have the opportunity and responsibility 
        to do what we can to save energy. There are serious financial as well 
        as environmental reasons to conserve energy. Bowdoin's electricity bill 
        for 00-01 was over $1,600,000. If we make a serious dent in the electricity 
        costs of the school, there will be more money for new professors, programs 
        and maybe even lower tuition.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin facilities management has started installing more 
        energy saving technology, but as individuals we can make a big difference. 
        If you are leaving your lights, your stereo, or your computer on all day 
        and all night you can start decreasing the need for new more coal mining 
        and oil drilling immediately by stopping today. One frequently asked lighting 
        question is whether or not to shut off fluorescent lights when leaving 
        the office. With the improvements in today's lamp manufacturing, a good 
        rule of thumb would be to turn out your lights if you will be gone 15 
        minutes or more. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The average computer system (with CPU, monitor and printer) 
        uses 200 watts of electricity. If that system were left on day and night 
        everyday, it would cost roughly $17.00 a month or $200 a year (at $0.12/kWh). 
        If that same system operated only 40 hours per week it would cost $3.84 
        a month, or $46 a year - that's a savings of over $150 per year. Multiply 
        that by the thousands of people working and living on the Bowdoin campus 
        and it adds up quickly! These turn into substantial savings for the average 
        household as well - as much as $13.00 per month. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">People often believe that a computer's life is shortened 
        by turning it on and off. This misconception has led some people to leaving 
        their computer on all the time. This was true some time ago - but it is 
        no longer the case. It is better for your operating system to start off 
        fresh every day. During the day, if you are just stepping away for a short 
        time, consider shutting off the monitor, which uses the most electricity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The offer of the college, includes the phrase, 'to count 
        nature as a familiar acquaintance,' let us take up that offer by acting 
        as informed and conscious citizens, treating nature with the respect it 
        deserves by preserving every drop of energy possible.</p>
