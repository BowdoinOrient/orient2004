      <p align="left">During the 1999-2000 school year, Bowdoin College threw 
        722.4 tons of waste in the local Brunswick landfill. In contrast, Bowdoin 
        recycled only 115.4 tons or 16 percent of its trash. As of 2000, the landfill 
        was 53 percent full and estimated to reach capacity and close by 2013.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left">
        <tr>

          <td><font size="2">Environmental Coordinator Keisha Payson. (Liesl Finn, 
            <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>) </font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">In order to combat such statistics as above, in June 2001 
        the College hired Keisha Payson as an environmental coordinator and coordinator 
        for the Committee for a Sustainable Bowdoin. Payson, former program assistant 
        in the Environmental Studies Department at the College, describes sustainability 
        as &quot;lessen[ing] the environmental impact of everyday campus operations 
        while looking for opportunities that will also save the college money.&quot; 
        She points out, for example, that it costs more for the College to haul 
        and dump its trash than to recycle it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some of Payson's most aggressive efforts have been directed 
        at the College's energy consumption. She explains, &quot;Bowdoin's electricity 
        bill for 2000-2001 was in excess of $1,600,000.&quot; In order to lessen 
        this cost, newer buildings have been designed to be more energy efficient 
        with features such as double-paned windows to diminish heating costs and 
        motion sensitive lighting. <br>
        Also, older buildings have been converted to be more energy efficient. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fluorescent and compact fluorescent lights, which use one-third 
        the energy of standard ones, have been installed throughout the campus. 
        In Coles Tower, in particular, thermostats have been installed in upper 
        level stories. Instead of unnecessarily overheating these floors and forcing 
        residents to open their windows during the middle of winter, students 
        will be able to determine a comfortable temperature. Since this comfortable 
        temperature will likely be below that which the College normally sets, 
        Bowdoin will save on heating costs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In terms of heating, Payson has also targeted the freshmen 
        dormitories. Eventually, she and the Office of Residential Life would 
        like to have more than enough on-campus housing available. Then, they 
        will be able to shut down one of these dorms each year and remodel its 
        entire heating system.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Other campus residences that have often been overlooked 
        in terms of sustainability are the Apartments of Brunswick, Harpswell, 
        Mayflower, and Pine Street. Beginning this year, apartment residents will 
        be given blue bins to put recyclable material in. Pine Tree Waste Capitol 
        Transfer will pick up these materials every Tuesday morning. More information 
        about when the program begins and what time pick up is will be available 
        shortly. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dining Services has been working with Payson to minimize 
        waste, too. It is working on such ideas as using recycled water in the 
        dishwasher machines as well as composting, which would divert a large 
        volume of waste from the landfill.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Computer Information Services will continue to reuse retired 
        computers by donating them to local schools and other groups. In recent 
        years, Bowdoin has donated nearly 10,000 pounds of computer equipment 
        to schools in the towns of Topsham, Harpswell, Bowdoinham, and Bowdoin. 
        Not only did the local schools benefit, but the College diverted all that 
        tonnage from the local landfill.<br>
        Since reuse only delays the eventual cluttering of the landfill, Payson 
        has looked into long term solution to recycle the computers and their 
        parts. She has located Crow, International, a Maine located operation 
        that recycles the parts from computers, laptops, keyboards, and gaming 
        controls.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Payson is diligently researching and implementing 
        new methods to sustain an environmentally sound Bowdoin, she is most interested 
        in the oldest and most efficient method: student involvement. Students 
        can become involved simply by privately doing their part: taking a reusable 
        bag to get a bag-lunch, turning off the lights, and especially turning 
        off their computers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In addition, Payson is hopeful that students will work directly 
        with her. Bowdoin's goal this year is to double the percentage we recycle 
        and make it 30 percent. Other schools such as Bates and Middlebury recycle 
        as much as 60 percent. If you are interested and would like to help, please 
        visit Payson in room 12 of the Tower or call her at x3086.<br>
