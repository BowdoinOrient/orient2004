      <p align="left">The humidity is gone now, gone with the rumbling thunderstorm 
        that meandered across our campus last night. It took with it perhaps one 
        of summer's finishing touches, and left me behind, running through the 
        rain and wishing the warmth of the evening would never have to leave. 
        As if eight years old again, I reveled in the beauty of the storm, staring 
        wide-eyed and grinning at a flashing sky as I waited for the next bolt 
        to fork across the clouds. The excitement, the electricity, the atmosphere 
        sparked my memory of the muggy days of summer, to the full &quot;Thunder 
        Moon&quot; of July, with my brother and I chasing thunderstorms as they 
        tore across Cape Cod Bay, trying to glimpse the powerful bolts that illuminated 
        the sky, bolts that have always commanded my fascination. And as I reflected 
        up on the last three months away from Bowdoin, I realized I found something 
        this past summer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I found a smothered part of my childhood, a part forgotten 
        long ago when the stress of growing up and the expectations of becoming 
        someone began to introduce adulthood. I found excitement, I rediscovered 
        a best friend (my brother), and I found the things in life that fuel my 
        spirit. My brother, three years younger than I, spent the entire summer 
        together, doing everything and anything we could think of, and most often 
        taking risks that we felt we never had as kids. From our new found hobby 
        of jumping into creeks from the bridges that traverse them, to scaling 
        rock faces, to numerous contests on just how many times each of us could 
        skip a rock across the ocean surface, our adventures were many. And while 
        I didn't spend the summer advancing into the real world, I spent it doing 
        things I enjoyed. From running a basketball together to rounds of mini-golf 
        to body surfing on the weekends, we were inseparable. I realize now, that 
        beyond anything else this summer, spending time with together was the 
        best thing I could have ever done.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My brother brought me up to Bowdoin this fall, staying a 
        few nights as a prospective senior's chance to visit a college campus. 
        My two world's collided, and the bittersweet nature of arriving back on 
        campus struck hard. While I was obligated to attend meetings and partake 
        in numerous icebreakers, and embarrassing myself when I had forgotten 
        names that I should have known, I already missed the adrenaline rush of 
        jumping into creeks far below and catching those great waves that crash 
        onto Cape Cod's shore. And so, we went to every exciting place near Bowdoin 
        I could think of. From Popham, to hiking up Morse Mountain (and every 
        cliff face off the beaten path we could find on the way up), to Giant 
        Steps, I wanted to show him everything exciting about Maine. We found 
        ourselves one day rock hopping at Giant Steps, accompanied by a large, 
        pounding surf fueled by a tropical depression off-shore. It was perhaps 
        our last chance to do something thrilling, and each seizing the moment, 
        we scrambled to the highest rock faces confronting the crashing waves. 
        We sat, poised on the edge and feet dangling over, as wave after wave 
        crashed down around us. It was thrilling. It was exciting. And it embodied 
        everything our summer together was. We were soaked, we were cold, and 
        neither of us wanted to leave. Just one more wave&#133;..<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But now, Bowdoin begs for my attention. It demands my concentration 
        through classes, even though my hand cramps after a summer reprieve of 
        handwriting. It calls for maturity, and expects I pay attention to the 
        person who I'm supposed to be. And while the stress of growing up may 
        have been erased with the welcoming of my twenties, the pressure of adulthood 
        is ever so present. But while all that happens, I know I have rediscovered 
        my childhood, rediscovered the thrilling moments in life that will always 
        bring a smile to my face. And so, as fall breezes glide across campus, 
        rustling and shaking the leaves, enticing them to turn their most vibrant 
        colors as one last tribute to summer's best sunsets, I'll keep my eye 
        on the sky. September's Harvest Moon was full just a few days earlier, 
        and while it reminds people to gather the things they cultivated over 
        the summer, I know I already have.<br>
