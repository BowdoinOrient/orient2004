      <p>In a joint effort by the Communications and Public Affairs Office, Computer 
        and Information Services, the Educational Technology Services, the Library, 
        Student Affairs, the Web Management Group, and the Web Working Group, 
        the Bowdoin website (<a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu">www.bowdoin.edu</a>) 
        underwent a complete overhaul.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;This is a project that has been in the works since the summer of 
        1998,&quot; stated Scott Hood, the Associate Vice President and Director 
        of Communications and Public Affairs. &quot;We wanted to build a site 
        that would lay the groundwork for future development.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to a brand new design, the site includes the use of plug-ins 
        (such as Flash), an improved search function from the last website, and 
        faster loading times. The new site also incorporates a more user-friendly 
        interface than the previous one. Each page can also accommodate more text 
        and pictures. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The original Bowdoin website was designed in 1997. On that website, text, 
        data, and graphics were combined together, making it very difficult for 
        web designers to change something easily. This proved especially difficult 
        for faculty and offices who wanted to put up their own website within 
        the Bowdoin site.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;People wanted more room for material,&quot; said Hood. &quot;The 
        old site didn't allow for much text to be put on the site, but the pages 
        on this site are much bigger.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The previous site had other problems, too. In December of 2000, students 
        performed 'usability tests' on the Bowdoin site, in which computer response 
        rates were timed while the students looked for specific links and information. 
        The test found that the original Bowdoin website was among the slowest 
        loading of all college and university sites reviewed. Complaints were 
        also received concerning the organization of the site.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In response, the site was designed to not only load quicker, but also 
        to be more easily navigable.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Campus information booklets aimed primarily for prospective first-year 
        students have also been redesigned in the same ways as the website. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The old website had no identity. The new design has a major consistency 
        to always allow people to know that they're still on a Bowdoin website,&quot; 
        said Hood. He believes that it is this strong identity that can help to 
        attract prospective students to Bowdoin. Hood goes on to say, &quot;All 
        of the college websites I've been to have buildings and foliage and these 
        bucolic landscapes. To a prospective student used to all of that, Massachusetts 
        Hall isn't going to be very interesting.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Not everyone is impressed with the new website, however. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Adam Ureneck '04 stated, &quot;To me, the Bowdoin home page serves two 
        purposes-for the students as a directory, and for virtual visitors as 
        a small glimpse at the school. As a student, the page is harder to use, 
        and a bit frilly. I'm already here, though. So I don't need to be wooed. 
        For those not at Bowdoin, I can see how the page would be impressive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The site, however, is not finished yet. Features to be added soon are 
        an online campus tour and a 'gateway' feature, which would allow easy 
        navigation to home pages for specific audiences, such as alumni, students, 
        faculty, and parents.<br>
