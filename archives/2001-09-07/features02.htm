      <p align="left"><br>
        I cannot begin a series on the Civil War Era without referring first to 
        that grand gentleman who has become a legend and a symbol of the American 
        volunteer soldier, Joshua Chamberlain. Perhaps no other story in the American 
        Civil War can rival that of the young college professor who went off to 
        join Mr. Lincoln's armies and found not only military glory but also national 
        recognition.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are so many things that one may say about Joshua Chamberlain 
        that at times it might appear no one else in the Civil War mattered. Yet 
        there were millions of Americans, Northerners and Southerners fighting 
        in that great war, which so many seem to scorn as nothing more than an 
        imperialistic endeavor. What became of all of these men who came to Lincoln's 
        call? Certainly the story of so many is impossible to tell, a point is 
        furthered by the fact that most of those patriots were dead by the end 
        of the fourth year of the War itself. We can, however, attempt to tell 
        of the lives of a few of them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hopefully the Oliver Howard series, run in last year's <i>Orient</i>, 
        helped to further an understanding about another Bowdoin man who became 
        a Civil War legend. This new series on two, and at times a few more, Bowdoin 
        men will revolve mainly around William Pitt Fessenden and Thomas Worchester 
        Hyde. <br>
        Fessenden was a senator during the War and eventually rose to become Lincoln's 
        Secretary of the Treasury in 1864. His career in the Senate spanned decades 
        as he fought against the Kansas-Nebraska deal, radical secessionists and 
        the impeachment of Andrew Johnson. His tale is one of dedication and simple 
        doggedness. <br>

      <p align="left">Hyde was a rich man's son who breezed through life like 
        it was a grand adventure. Quite youthful at the time of the Civil War, 
        he would emerge from that conflict as one of its youngest generals. His 
        career in the War followed the path of the Sixth Corps of the Union Army 
        of the Potomac. Through his eyes we shall revisit the battlefields of 
        Virginia once again. His story is one of a child as well as that of an 
        adventurer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In this series we shall also encounter a number of other 
        Bowdoin men. One of them is not remembered well by history, and as far 
        as my research goes, has no right to be. His name was Franklin Pierce. 
        The College remembers him for the simple fact that he was the fourteenth 
        president of the United States and nothing more. In reality, there really 
        was nothing more.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">William Fessenden's sons, Frank Fessenden and Sam Fessenden 
        were also Bowdoin men and their lives would be forever changed by the 
        Civil War. <br>
        This series is one about families and friends. It is a series about soldiers 
        and politicians and fathers and sons. But above all, this is a series 
        about courage and integrity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Should you think that I have no interest in expanding beyond 
        the years of the Civil War, let me put your fears at rest and assure you 
        that this liberal arts education has not failed to persuade me that there 
        is more to life than just the undying conflict between the blue and gray.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Fessenden and Hyde Series will be a mere filler. It 
        should run the course of the Fall 2001 semester but my plans for a far 
        longer series have already begun to take shape. It is my hope that by 
        next spring we shall be able to tell the tale of the Bowdoin men who went 
        off to another war in the winter of 1941. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And so with a little luck and a little bit of writing, we 
        should be able to bring you a continuous stream of stories and tales about 
        the people who once walked the halls and the fields of Bowdoin College.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next Week: Fessenden and Pierce attend Bowdoin College.</p>
