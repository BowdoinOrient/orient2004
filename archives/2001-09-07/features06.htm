      <p align="left"><i><font size="2">This is the first in an occasional series 
        of &quot;Beyond Bowdoin&quot; articles aimed at exploring some of the 
        interesting events and learning about some of the people in the Great 
        State of Maine.</font></i><br>
        <br>
        This summer, much of the news' coverage began with the depressing reality 
        of the Middle East conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis, and 
        the continuous bloodshed in the region. Headlines similar to &quot;Six 
        Palestinian Officials Killed in the West Bank&quot; or &quot;Suicide Bomber 
        Kills Five in Jewish Caf&eacute;&quot; were not uncommon. At the same 
        time bombs were going off overseas, Palestinian and Israeli teenagers 
        were living together in the remote town of Otisfield, Maine, in a drastically 
        different kind of environment where peace predominates. All this happens 
        at a small but very significant camp called Seeds of Peace. I visited 
        two members of our Bowdoin community there as they participated in and 
        witnessed this inspirational and, in many ways, historic saga unfold.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wil Smith, who is Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs 
        and a member of the Bowdoin Class of 2000, has worked at Seeds, as it 
        is often called, for three summers, and was the Assistant Head Counselor 
        of the camp this year. Emily Duffus, who is the Vice President of Howell 
        House and a member of the Bowdoin Class of 2003, also worked as a counselor 
        this summer in her first year at the camp.<br>

      <p align="left">Seeds of Peace was founded by former journalist John Wallach, 
        who had spent many years reporting on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict 
        in the Middle East. Wallach wanted to do more than simply report on the 
        struggles in Israel, so he started a peace camp in Maine that brought 
        together Palestinian and Israeli teenagers. In his book, The Enemy Has 
        a Face: The Seeds of Peace Experience, Wallach says, &quot;Seeds of Peace 
        was an idea that seemed to make sense: Bring the next generation together 
        before they too fall victim to the hate that ensnares their parents and 
        grandparents - bring them together and see what happens.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the first day of camp, Wil and Emily already began to 
        see evidence that peace between two groups who consider themselves enemies 
        is a very difficult goal to achieve. &quot;You see the distrust in their 
        eyes.&quot; Wil says, &quot;There's an Israeli or a Palestinian sleeping 
        next to me &#133; it's tough.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Instead of focusing on their differences, the camp concentrates 
        on what they have in common -- they are all teenagers who want to have 
        some fun. And they certainly do. It's very easy, though, for the campers 
        to only interact with their own group while away from their homes and 
        in a foreign place with people they have been taught to hate. They are 
        grouped into teams with both Palestinians and Israelis and they play basketball, 
        soccer, go swimming, water-ski, play tennis, arts and crafts, act in the 
        camp theatre, and do just about anything else that summer camp could offer. 
        Even the location of the camp in remote Otisfield, Maine, along Pleasant 
        Lake is designed to help the students feel at home and away from the pressures 
        of society. Despite the appearance of any ordinary summer camp, Seeds 
        is no ordinary camp, since its mission is &quot;to help humanize a conflict 
        that has thrived partly because both sides have so successfully dehumanized 
        each other&quot; (Wallach 8). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Possibly the most challenging and yet beneficial part of 
        &quot;humanizing&quot; the camp experience are the &quot;coexistence sessions.&quot; 
        For two hours each day, groups of twelve students, led by facilitators, 
        participate in sessions where many underlying beliefs are drawn out of 
        each student as they discuss the events that occur back in their homeland. 
        It's their chance to explore the conflict with the other side.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Often times, there are two very different historical accounts 
        of the same event. And as Wil points out, in many cases, &quot;It's the 
        first time they've heard the other side. There's usually a lot of anger, 
        hurt and tears &#133;&quot; After the coexistence session, Seeds immediately 
        puts the students back on the grassy fields to play sports together once 
        again and not let them dwell on the emotional discussion they just experienced. 
        Wil recalls one student saying, &quot;I was just hating the other side, 
        and now I'm helping them score a goal.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Conflicting emotions seem to be the norm as students grapple 
        with the stereotypes they have been taught at home and their individual 
        experience at camp with the other side.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Emily Duffus saw how many of the campers began to change 
        and grow over the course of the summer. &quot;(They) get an understanding 
        of both sides &#133; we're all human beings and they realize that violence 
        is happening against the other side who is just like them.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was a fabulous experience to see two groups, who normally 
        are in the news because of continuous killing of each other, and now they 
        are in the news because in Otisfield, Maine they are at peace with each 
        other. As Wil Smith sums up, &quot;This model should be used more often. 
        Bring them together, take them away from society's influences, share their 
        true feelings, and only then can you begin to trust and respect&#133; 
        it's been said they can't work together, (but) put ten to twelve boys 
        and girls together and they form a family.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the summer ends, the ultimate question remains: Can the 
        Middle East ever have peace? Emily Duffus says, &quot;There's always somewhere 
        to start the process.&quot; And Wil believes that &quot;Anything is possible. 
        That's why we are there.&quot; At this camp, anything does seem possible. 
        Only time will tell.<br>
