        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Even as some of us are chuckling quietly to ourselves, 
        other Americans are hysterical over the rise of the GOP to control the 
        White House, Senate and House of Representatives. How could this happen? 
        We're all doomed! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Well, as a card carrying member of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, I'm 
        privy to all sorts of secret information, and yes, you're all screwed. 
        Big Oil, Big Pharmaceutical, Big Industry, the NRA, Special Interest Inc., 
        the North American Baby Seal Hunters Association and the Forces of Mordor 
        will now be calling all the shots. Why? Because the Republicans are in 
        charge. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If someone says &quot;Republican,&quot; what image jumps to your mind? 
        Bush? Ashcroft? Pat Robertson? Some white guy in a suit? Some stereotypical 
        image, no doubt. And yet, somehow, this elite group of rich white males 
        has managed to outvote all the other more sensible, more liberal people. 
        How could this be? </p>
      <p align="left"> The answer is &quot;South Park Republicans.&quot; They 
        are the ones that gave the election to the GOP. This name first came, 
        so far as I can tell, from Andrew Sullivan, former editor of The New Republic. 
        He is an openly gay, HIV positive, Bush supporting, Catholic Conservative 
        who writes a brilliant weblog at <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com">www.andrewsullivan.com</a>.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The general point behind &quot;South Park Republicans&quot; is that not 
        all conservatives fit that old rich white guy mold, and in fact, they 
        fit much more to the mold of mainstream America. They can see Britney 
        Spears' new outfit and not immediately declare the moral fabric of the 
        people to be in jeopardy. They can appreciate the humor of shows like 
        &quot;South Park,&quot; although others have called it a moral nightmare. 
        They like free markets, but may still look to buy American. Self-determination, 
        and self-reliance, is important, and they may or may not go to church.</p>
      <p align="left">
        They get a kick out of the idea that Arnold Schwarzenegger might be the 
        next Governor of California. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They roll their eyes equally at the National Organization of Women and 
        the Christian Coalition. They laugh at inappropriate jokes, the politically 
        correct, the too uptight and themselves. They drink bad beer, and have 
        a good time, but understand the need for sacrifice and tradition. Basically, 
        they know what they like and they like what they do. Within reason. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They aren't thrilled by huge international companies, but neither are 
        they married to the need to preserve ANWR. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They are black, white, old, young, male, female, gay and straight. They 
        recognize that there are two major parties in America, and nobody agrees 
        with everything in either party. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I want to point this out for a few reasons. First of all, the idea of 
        tax-cutting, gun-toting, suit-wearing Republicans is a little narrow. 
        Some of us don't even like the taste of Scotch. Second of all, it's important 
        to understand that while we should take politics seriously, it's also 
        important to laugh about them. Many people understand this, which is why 
        &quot;The Daily Show&quot; with Jon Stewart is so popular.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Likewise, it's sometimes important to joke about issues here on campus. 
        For example, the paper cup fiasco that has momentarily overtaken Iraq 
        and terrorism as the central concern of the campus. This is silly in and 
        of itself. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Playing on this, last week, I penned (one'd and zero'd?) a letter to the 
        editor about Sustainable Bowdoin and the paper cup policy. I used terms 
        like &quot;dictatorial&quot;, &quot;tyrannical,&quot; and made allusions 
        to &quot;justice.&quot; If these exaggerations were not enough, I blatantly 
        cribbed the first line of the letter from the Declaration of Independence, 
        and made several other references to it throughout. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This was meant to be satirical. I have far too much respect for the Declaration 
        to use it seriously in an argument about paper cups and Dining Services. 
        Some people picked this up, and regardless of their opinion on the appropriateness 
        of paper cups, thought it was funny. Others did not. And some didn't seem 
        to understand that while I do think we should keep paper cups, the outlandish 
        rhetoric was meant as a joke. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The need to take things in stride and laugh every once in a while, even 
        about things you care deeply about, is the hallmark of South Park Republicans. 
        I'm glad they're in charge. </p>
