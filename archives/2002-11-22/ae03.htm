      <p align="left">It is very hard to find a movie in today's world or in movie 
        history that does not, to some degree, focus on the concerns of life within 
        a household setting. There seems to be an overwhelming attraction for 
        a director or writer to use a house as a very simple, conventional and 
        extremely relatable location, regardless of whether the story deals with 
        family issues directly or indirectly. </p>
      <p align="left"> The same can be said for sitcoms. Shows like <i>Home Improvement</i>, 
        <i>Step by Step</i>, <i>Family Matters</i>, and <i>The Simpsons</i> all 
        have this trait in common. They deal directly with family problems inside 
        the home, rather than those that exist in the real world. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The pitfall of sitcoms is that they always try to teach us something, 
        and the situation that seems to create the most problems and merit the 
        most lessons on life can be found behind the white picket fence, in a 
        symmetrical, tidy living room. </p>
      <p align="left"> The show can seek to idealize the typical American family 
        of overachievers, like <i>The Brady Bunch</i>, or they choose a more interesting 
        path and venture into the realm of abnormal, dysfunctional family setups. 
        The shows that present family concerns within a network of a larger concerns 
        outside of the family, focus on other aspects of life like relationships 
        or the work environment. Television shows that do this skillfully are 
        <i>Boy Meets World</i>, <i>Fresh Prince</i>, and <i>Seventh Heaven</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">
        My original goal in writing this article was to find movies that deal 
        with family concerns with a holiday setting, preferably Thanksgiving. 
        My search was, for the most part, unproductive. I urge you all to take 
        five minutes and think of movies that you've seen that take place during 
        Thanksgiving. </p>
      <p align="left"> With the exception of <i>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving</i>, 
        you will find that it takes a lot longer than five minutes. I realized 
        that it is easier to find this family setting in movies that do not directly 
        try to outline them by having them take place in seasons that 'bring together 
        the whole family' like Christmas or Thanksgiving. </p>
      <p align="left"> Movies like <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>The Sound of Music</i> 
        seek to give the moviegoer something that they can go to see with their 
        whole family and enjoy because it brings up themes that are relevant to 
        their lives. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It is also interesting to see how the household can transcend a stereotypical 
        family movie. The film does not have to be about family relationships 
        or hardships to be placed into a family setting. </p>
      <p align="left"> For example, movies <i>like Poltergeist</i> and <i>The 
        Gate</i> are horror movies that are primarily stories about alien occurrences, 
        but they are stories that are set inside the household, and therefore 
        simultaneously bring family themes into the story. For example, in <i>The 
        Gate</i>, a young boy's action of battling the monsters in his house is 
        paralleled to earning trust and respect from the rest of his family. </p>
      <p align="left"> There are also action movies, like <i>Ransom</i> that are 
        superimposed into a family situation, but if you asked someone what the 
        movie was about, they would say it was primarily an action-packed movie 
        about a kidnapping. </p>
      <p align="left"> This trend in family-oriented movies is not one that existed 
        primarily in past decades, but something that I see stressed more and 
        more by popular culture in today's world. It seemed that for a certain 
        period of time, American cinema was dominated by movies that did nothing 
        but present a profile of a dysfunctional family, notably movies like <i>American 
        Beauty</i> and <i>Life as a House</i>. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It makes one wonder whether the public is becoming more and more attracted 
        to movies that are directly applicable to their own lives, or whether 
        it is really only Hollywood's chance to get one more family member to 
        buy a ticket. I also wonder whether these television shows and films actually 
        penetrate the lives of American families and have a sincere impact on 
        the way that we learn about the world in which we live. </p>
