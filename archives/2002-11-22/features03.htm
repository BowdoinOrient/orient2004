      <p align="left">Todd Williams: I took a year off after high school and after 
        traveling I worked in a bike shop. There was a fire station right next 
        to us and one day the lieutenant came in and asked if anyone wanted to 
        go on a ride-along and I was like &quot;Yes&#133;sign me up!&quot; After 
        that I went in one night and hung out with the guys, it was like a big 
        fraternity-I got to hang out with them, we made dinner, washed the fire 
        engines-it was the coolest thing ever. The first call I remember jumping 
        into the engine and going to the scene watching everyone scramble to get 
        their gear on, the sirens were wailing, the lights were flashing-everyone 
        knew their job right away and it was so cool watching everyone put out 
        the fire and work together as a team to accomplish a goal. It seemed like 
        something that I would be totally into. I came home and told my parents 
        I was going to the fire academy instead of Bowdoin&#133;they disagreed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Travis Brennan: Ever since I was a little kid I've always thought that 
        fire trucks were the coolest things in the world; they have flashing lights 
        and make loud noises. Then at the end of my freshman year I decided that 
        the fire department was something that I was really interested in and 
        that I wanted to become a fire fighter in some capacity. So, I became 
        an intern for the Portland fire department and started doing work with 
        them like ride-a-longs where I would go on all the calls and also started 
        doing fire education in the Portland school system. It was all really 
        really fun, so naturally from that I decided why not become a member of 
        the Brunswick Fire Department. </p>
      <p>Q: What type of training is involved in your job?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: As a volunteer fire fighter in Brunswick, in order to be able 
        to do building entry and wear an air pack you have to go through a six-month 
        class and Travis and I both took the class last semester here. It went 
        from January to June and we would meet every other Sunday learning all 
        sorts of stuff-from looking at building construction to learning how to 
        put on an air pack to fire attack and some emergency medical stuff. So 
        there are six months of certification classes you have to go through in 
        order to be Fire Fighter I certified.</p>
      <p>Q: How many volunteer fire fighters does Brunswick have, and are you 
        and Travis the only ones from Bowdoin?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: Yes. We are the only volunteer fire fighters from Bowdoin right 
        now, but Brunswick has about 30 volunteer fire fighters and 24 full-time 
        ones. They usually have openings for more volunteers.</p>
      <p>Q: Do you have the same capabilities as the full-time fire fighters?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: Basically we can do everything except for drive and pump the 
        engines.</p>
      <p>Q: How often do you have organized meetings?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brennan: For the call department here in Brunswick we have one monthly 
        meeting-the first Monday of every month. Then the third Monday of every 
        month we do a training of some sort. But for example, this month a building 
        opened up for us to burn down, so we have had three trainings this and 
        a monthly meeting this month. </p>
      <p>Q: How does the fire station contact you in an emergency?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: I wear a beeper. I turn it off in class, but definitely if it 
        is a class that I don't want to be in I might turn it on and be like &quot;sorry 
        I've gotta go.&quot;</p>
      <p>Q: Are you on call twenty-four hours?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brennan: The call department is pretty much voluntary on what calls you 
        want to respond to and what ones you don't. I choose to keep my pager 
        on 24 hours a day unless there's some reason I can't, like if I go to 
        a movie or am out of range, but generally when I am in Brunswick I am 
        ready to go to any call, because the worst thing I could ever imagine 
        happening is turning off my beeper for a few minutes and missing a fire.</p>
      <p>Q: How many hours a week time commitment is this for you?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brennan: It really varies. Some weeks maybe go by and you really don't 
        do anything at all, you just kind of sit back and look at your equipment, 
        but then one week you can get a bunch of calls. If you get a fire generally, 
        a good fire, you can be working from eleven at night till four-thirty 
        in the morning-and that is just one call. I'd say average on it works 
        out to be maybe three hours a week.</p>
      <p>Q: What other activities do you do?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: I'm big into surfing and I'm also involved in organizing the 
        EMT class here along with being a proctor.</p>
      <p>Q: What is the most fulfilling part of your job?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: Saving babies from burning buildings-Backdraft style&#133;.no 
        really, I would say one of the best parts is the open house down at the 
        fire station every year during fire prevention week. They have hundreds 
        of kids from all over Brunswick come in and look at the engines and climb 
        all over them. We give them balloons and they slide down the fire pole 
        and have a great time-so I think that is one of the most fulfilling parts 
        for me&#133;the community interaction. I would also say that seeing someone 
        who is truly thankful for you being there, whether it is a fire or any 
        medical emergency-feeling like you can put your knowledge to use in order 
        to help someone and see them turn out for the better because of it, is 
        really fulfilling I would say. </p>
      <p>Q: Do you have a dangerous story?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brennan: There are two dangerous stories I guess I have. One came in the 
        first fire Todd and I went into last year. That was the first time I had 
        been in a real fire and just walking around was dangerous-there was holes 
        in the floor, you can't see anything because you are wearing your mask, 
        and you really realize how kind of precarious your situation is. Another 
        dangerous story, more on a medical side, when I was riding along down 
        in Portland we went into a domestic violence situation. The ambulance 
        pulled up and there were cops there and this lady came running out of 
        the house screaming that he had choked them and that he had a gun and 
        stuff like that-so that was definitely a tension filled situation until 
        the police took charge.</p>
      <p>Q: Do you see any future here?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: I'm planning on going back home to Portland, Oregon in February 
        to test for a fire agency there and in May I think Portland, Maine is 
        offering a test too-so after college I would love to work for a fire department, 
        maybe even go into fire administration.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brennan: Yeah, I mean it's hard. You go to Bowdoin, and Bowdoin is definitely 
        not the ideal school to train to be a fire fighter. It isn't known for 
        producing fire fighters it is known for producing business men and women 
        and lawyers and such, but with the experiences I have had with the fire 
        departments I am really interested in and plan on doing some of the test 
        at the fire departments to continue my interest.</p>
      <p>Q: Anything else you would like to add?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Williams: We don't get cats down from trees.</p>
