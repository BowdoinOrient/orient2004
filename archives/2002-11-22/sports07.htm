        <font size="2">J.P. BOX</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Stop watching college football. Why waste a perfectly good 
        Saturday afternoon? Or if you do, do me a favor: write your local congressman 
        and tell him or her that the college game stinks.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Why the negative attitude? I hate the Bowl Championship Series and its 
        twisted reign on college football. Instead of watching teams decide the 
        outcome of the season, we anxiously await for a computer program to release 
        a cryptic numerical analysis.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Case in point: the Miami Hurricanes are the number-one ranked team in 
        the nation with an aggregate BCS total of 3.69. The number-two ranked 
        Ohio State Buckeyes, however, are right on the Canes' tale with a total 
        of 3.70. Gee, I wonder if the Buckeyes can pick up that .01 this weekend!</p>
      <p align="left">
        How do you pick up a fraction of a point in a football game? An extra 
        point is worth one point, a safety is worth two, a field goal is worth 
        three, and a touchdown is worth a whopping six. That's the real math for 
        a football game. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the BCS system provides a more complicated equation-evidently, 
        a simple score is not sufficient. First of all, a panel of seven &quot;experts&quot; 
        ranks each college team subjectively. Peter Wolfe and the ambiguous New 
        York Times are two of the faces sitting in the bench of judgment. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Welcome to your high school's prom queen and king contest. Essentially, 
        the highest ranked teams beat up big-time on the chumps (losers of your 
        high school), garner media attention, and have few blemishes on their 
        record. The popularity contest has begun!</p>
      <p>A simple average is taken of the &quot;expert&quot; rankings of each 
        team. To lend authenticity, the BCS website calls this process a &quot;Computer 
        Average.&quot; I mean, a human being could not possibly add up seven numbers 
        and divide by seven.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After this calculation is completed (by a computer, thankfully), we have 
        the &quot;Schedule Strength&quot; category, which produces another important 
        number. Of course, it is a fraction once again. By calculating the cumulative 
        win/loss record of a team's opponents as well as the team's opponents' 
        opponents, you somehow can get this ranking if you divide it by 25. Confused 
        yet? Me too.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Currently, the University of Southern California has the toughest schedule 
        in college football. How do I know this? The BCS computer declares that 
        the Trojans have a .04 ranking for schedule strength. On the other hand, 
        Kansas State has a ranking of 2.20.</p>
      <p>Next, comes the only bias-free category: &quot;Losses.&quot; For each 
        loss, a team receives one point. But remember, the BCS is like golf in 
        that points are bad. You want a low score.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally, the BCS has its &quot;Quality Win Component.&quot; If a team 
        were to beat the number one ranked Hurricanes, it would receive a score 
        of -1. If that same team were to beat the number ten ranked Texas Longhorns, 
        it would receive a negative one-tenth of a point.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mercifully, the BCS' string of ambiguity ends here-as a reward, we receive 
        a &quot;Total&quot; mess. Combine a &quot;Computer Average,&quot; &quot;Schedule 
        Strength,&quot; &quot;Losses,&quot; &quot;Quality Win Component,&quot; 
        and you get the outcome of the NCAA college football season. Doesn't this 
        strike you as wrong?</p>
      <p align="left">
        What happens on Saturday doesn't really matter in the end. Fans should 
        stop wasting their time praying for a miracle on the field-the real battle 
        happens within a computer that spews out a fate-deciding number. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Keith Jackson shouldn't be announcing the game! He should be giving us 
        the play-by-play of the computer calculations. Can't you just hear him? 
        &quot;Oh Nelly! The Buckeyes come up .01 short to the Canes!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        I'll start watching college football when the NCAA gives the boot to the 
        BCS and adopts a playoff system. Critics are quick to point out that the 
        NCAA makes millions by selling the naming rights of bowl games to the 
        likes of Nokia, Tostitos, and FedEx. Thus, college football would never 
        part with its corporate sponsors.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Complacently, we accept the fact that the best football on New Year's 
        Eve and Day is essentially the Corporate Coup. Regardless of your suasions 
        on capitalism, its grip of the sport is undeniable. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, its effects need not taint the sport or drive away would-be spectators. 
        If college football were to adapt a 32-team, five-week playoff system, 
        many of its problems would be solved. A truly national champion would 
        emerge without the help of a computer program, and corporate America could 
        promote the winter version of March Madness. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Additionally, the NCAA could push Nokia, Tostitos, and FedEx into an absurd 
        bidding war to secure advertising rights for the real national championship 
        game. The college game would produce more money, while attracting a broader 
        fan base.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Or, we could continue to monitor the outcome of a math equation. No offense 
        to math majors: I know you love what you do. It's just that I love sports, 
        and that's what I want to watch. Is that so much to ask?</p>
