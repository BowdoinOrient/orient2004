        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.
		<br>DUDLEY COE HEALTH CENTER</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: What have you heard about the new birth control 
        rings and patches? A.A.</p>
      <p>Dear A.A: There have been a number of interesting developments in birth 
        control technology over the last few years. Some involve new &quot;delivery 
        systems&quot; for familiar contraceptive medications. Others involve a 
        new approach to medical contraception itself.</p>
      <p align="left">
        NuvaRing, OrthoEvra patches, and Lunelle injections are three of the newest 
        contraceptive options. All three offer novel delivery systems for standard 
        birth control pill hormones, and are particularly attractive options for 
        women who prefer not to have to take a pill every day. </p>
      <p align="left">
        NuvaRing is a thin, flexible, silver dollar-sized vaginal ring that releases 
        steady, low doses of contraceptive hormones into the bloodstream. It's 
        left in place for three weeks, and removed the fourth week for menstruation. 
        NuvaRing is at least as effective as regular birth control pills, and 
        its steady dose of hormones causes fewer side effects. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The only reason NuvaRing is worn vaginally, of course, is discretion. 
        In pre-marketing studies, though, about 18 percent of women and 30 percent 
        of men reported feeling the ring at least occasionally during intercourse. 
        NuvaRing can be removed before sex, but must be replaced within three 
        hours for contraceptive efficacy. As a contraceptive strategy, though, 
        this seems a little risky and self-defeating!</p>
      <p align="left">
        OrthoEvra is the new contraceptive patch. It also delivers a steady state 
        of contraceptive hormones, but does so externally, through the skin. OrthoEvra 
        is a small, thin, beige patch that is worn on the upper outer arms, abdomen, 
        buttocks, or torso (but not the breast), for one week per patch, three 
        weeks in a row. Menstruation takes place during the fourth, patch-free 
        week. It also has at least the same, if not more, contraceptive efficacy 
        as regular birth control pills, and has the same favorable side effect 
        profile as NuvaRing. Clinical trials showed that patches adhere well while 
        bathing, swimming and exercising, and in all kinds of hot or humid weather.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Lunelle is a once-a-month injectable contraceptive. It needs to be given 
        in a medical office, every 28 to 30 days (but no longer than 33 days). 
        Unlike Depo-Provera, an older, injectable contraceptive, the effects of 
        Lunelle wear off within a month or two. It's highly effective, but may 
        cause slightly more side effects than regular pills. Lunelle's appeal 
        lies in its confidentiality and once-a-month single dosing. Its drawbacks 
        are having to come into a medical office within a short window of time 
        every month, and, of course, just getting a SHOT, EVERY month! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Seasonale is a new birth control pill designed to be taken for 91 consecutive 
        days, rather than the usual 28. It will become available sometime in the 
        New Year. Seasonale contains a cumulative amount of hormones that is slightly 
        lower than most conventional birth control pills, and postpones menstruation 
        until the last week of each three month cycle. In other words, taking 
        Seasonale is like taking the first three weeks' of regular birth control 
        pills, and then starting right into the first week's pills of the next 
        month's pack, and then doing the same again at the end of that second 
        pack - without &quot;pausing&quot; for the fourth week's placebo pills 
        and menstruation.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This approach, called &quot;continuous cycling&quot; contraception, is 
        very appealing in a number of ways. It makes the contraception even more 
        effective (no one-week &quot;breaks&quot; for your own cycle and hormones 
        to start up), and lessens cyclic side-effects. Many women are simply thrilled 
        to skip two out of every three periods! And very interestingly, it may 
        have definite health benefits, particularly in reducing one's risk for 
        ovarian and endometrial cancers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the other hand, continuous cycling may increase slightly the risk of 
        breast cancer, blood clots and stroke, particularly for women who smoke 
        or whose blood pressure is high. And for some women, monthly periods are 
        a reassuring sign that they're (most likely) not pregnant. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There's quite a discussion going on in the media these days, about whether 
        it's &quot;better&quot; or &quot;more natural&quot; to menstruate monthly. 
        It began with the publication in 1999 of a treatise by Elsimar Coutinho, 
        M.D., entitled Is Menstruation Obsolete? More recently, it was pointed 
        out in The New Yorker, that &quot;modern&quot; women have at least three 
        times more periods over their reproductive lifetimes than did their &quot;pre-modern&quot; 
        ancestors, who were far more often either pregnant or lactating, and hence 
        not ovulating. &quot;Excessive&quot; ovulation and endometrial stimulation 
        may in fact be unhealthy. Nuns, for instance, definitely have higher rates 
        of ovarian and endometrial cancers. So do women whose periods begin at 
        a very young age, and those who never have kids. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The (male) scientist who developed the first birth control pills was Catholic, 
        and very much wanted to offer women a contraceptive that seemed so &quot;natural&quot; 
        that it might slip under the radar screen of the Church. That's the reason 
        conventional birth control pills have a 28 day schedule! Many researchers 
        and clinicians are now questioning whether that schedule is natural or 
        necessary or even healthy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        So: very much as it should be, more options, more flexibility and control, 
        and more to consider!</p>
      <p align="left">
        Be well!</p>
