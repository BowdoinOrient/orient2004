        <font size="2">KERRY ELSON<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Preparing for Brunswick's second themed deli, the Foodie 
        shredded her trousers, mussed her hair and rolled in a muddy curbside 
        snowbank. Cockney accent rehearsed and jaunty newsboy cap placed atop 
        her head, she gambolled down Maine Street towards Broadway Delicatessen.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Allo, Guv,&quot; the Foodie declared to no one in particular as 
        she claimed a booth for herself. Though she craved hot sausage and mustard 
        for the main meal and a dessert of cold jelly and custard, the Foodie 
        found no such offerings on the Broadway menu. She settled instead on a 
        Western Omelette with a grilled bialy and a side of home fries. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other breakfast menu items include bagels and lox, french toast, fruit, 
        yogurt and granola parfait, and eggs prepared any style. Sandwiches, soups, 
        and salads fill out the lunch menu. Although Broadway's ingredient combinations 
        are not unique, the restaurant presents its basic items well. Such an 
        adherence to quality is refreshing at a time when, in the Foodie's opinion, 
        many establishments strive towards novelty at the expense of fine preparation 
        in order to distinguish themselves. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie considered herself at home in the cozy cave of the deli. She 
        even considered herself part of the furniture, as the brown muck on her 
        tattered rags matched the wood d&eacute;cor. Red vinyl booths line walls 
        replete with children's drawings while one table sits in the deli's front 
        window, allowing happy customers to advertise Broadway's fine food. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The lone waitress brought the requested provisions just as the Foodie's 
        hunger peaked. What glorious food! The Foodie was in rapture. Ham, white 
        cheddar, red onion and green pepper filling provided a sweet and salty 
        counterpoint to the fluffy eggs that enclosed it. The Foodie could see 
        the care with which the dish was prepared; she was charmed by the uneven 
        slices of onion, pepper and ham. Each filling was separately sauteed in 
        order to evoke individual flavors: the ham had an occasional crust, while 
        the carmelized red onion complemented the slightly bitter grilled green 
        pepper. Not in gooey excess, smooth white cheddar acted as an emulsifying 
        agent. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Broadway has also introduced the Foodie to the bialy. This flat, solid, 
        simply-decorated bread was chewy but not as filling as its more rotund 
        cousin, the bagel. Grilled and buttered, it served as the perfect base 
        for an open-faced omelette sandwich. The Foodie was also pleased by the 
        soft, cayenne-dusted homefries; unlike those at Grand City Restaurant, 
        these already palatable breakfast potatoes needed neither salt nor ketchup. 
        The only disappointment of the Foodie's breakfast was her beverage: though 
        she hoped it would be fresh squeezed, the grapefruit juice seemed to be 
        poured straight from a carton. Alas.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although not as impressive as the omelette, a fresh turkey sandwich at 
        lunchtime was also prepared with care. The wheat bread was dark and nutty, 
        while the turkey was tender and warm. Unlike Big Top Deli, however, Broadway 
        doesn't seem to be equipped to prepare dishes to go, so prospective patrons 
        should plan on eating in. The Foodie's sandwich, enclosed by tinfoil on 
        a paper plate, quickly fell apart and was cumbersome to carry. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It's clear the Foodie and Broadway Deli are going to get along. The waitress 
        at Broadway is the friendliest the Foodie has encountered at any restaurant 
        on Maine Street and the deli's prices are reasonable. She might even go 
        to Timbuktu, and yes, come BACK AGAIN to try another Western Omelette.
