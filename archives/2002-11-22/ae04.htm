            Room</i>. All plays were directed by students and featured student 
            actors. (Karsten Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The tables were set for a feast and the stage was set for 
        a theatrical banquet. It was to be a night of culinary delight coupled 
        with two humor filled one-acts-there is no greater way to spend a leisurely 
        evening. This was definitely dinner theatre.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
      <p align="left">The evening began with <i>All about Al</i>, a one act by 
        Cherie Vogelstein. The staging was sparse but tasteful and the setting 
        was a small coffee shop-the meeting place of two friends: Lenny, played 
        by Mike Balulescu '03, and Gil, played by Warren Dubitsky '04. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The one act was a mix of humor and serious dialogue concerning the dating 
        world, its ups and its downs. Lenny, a portly, kind fellow, has been sent 
        by Gil's girlfriend to try to convince Gil not to break up with him. During 
        the dialogue, it becomes apparent that Gil is quite a jerk-all to ready 
        to tell his friend about his girlfriend's willingness to &quot;give head.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The majority of the dialogue used shock factor in order to get laughs 
        out of the audience. However, despite its flippancy, the play also achieved 
        many moments of poignancy. By the end it was Gil that ended up with Allison, 
        played by Lynn Furick '04, who walked onto stage in skintight black boots 
        and a short skirt. </p>
      <p align="left"> After a brief interlude, during which desert was served-strawberry 
        rhubarb cobbler, in case you were wondering-the second one-act, <i>Naomi 
        in the Living Room</i> by Christopher Durang, began. The set consisted 
        of a chair, a couch, and a coffee table on which sat a small white rabbit. 
        Involving a mother whose mood swings were dizzying, her daughter in law, 
        and her son who wishes above all to be like his spouse, this play could 
        best be described as zany. It left many of the audience members slack-jawed 
        and hoping that reality would set back in as soon as possible.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After the mother, Naomi played by Faye Hargate '04, attempted to have 
        an orgasm on the couch-and quite convincingly to the actor's credit-one 
        might have asked how the situation could get stranger. This question was 
        soon answered when the son, John played by Daniel Bensen '06, walked in 
        dressed in the same fashion as his wife (flowered dress and pearls).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Caitlin Conolly '05 who worked on the props and set for the shows commented 
        that it was &quot;fun working on dinner theater.&quot; &quot;Both one 
        acts this year were fun crazy shows&quot; she said &quot;which I enjoyed 
        getting to see come together.&quot; Furthermore, she commented that &quot;Because 
        it is a low tech show, you get to have fun with small props without the 
        greater stress of a full theater production.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The great thing about Dinner Theatre, said Conolly, is that the audience 
        is &quot;so close to the action.&quot; Indeed, the stage and dinner setting 
        truly established a closer relation between actors and audience members. 
        &quot;Dinner theater,&quot; said Conolly &quot;is an intimate kind of 
        theater.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dinner theater was put on by Masque and Gown, which is celebrating its 
        100th year next year. The accompanying dinner was graciously provided 
        by Bowdoin College dining service.</p>
