        <font size="2">LARA JACOBS</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> For the first time, I understand how the Pilgrims felt. 
        No, I'm not going to Plymouth for Thanksgiving or exploring the &quot;New 
        World;&quot; this is not my &quot;first Thanksgiving&quot; in technical 
        terms. However it is my first Thanksgiving as a visitor in my home. Thinking 
        about this &quot;first&quot; brings up the question of what it really 
        means to go home. I tend to think of home as encompassing not only my 
        actual house, but also my family, friends and city; I may leave, change 
        and grow up-but home, and all of its associations, are permanent. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Boarding the plane, you can't help but remember wearing flannel pajamas 
        and cooking Cranberry sauce, while &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; plays 
        on ABC. Who could forget the annual game of Twister that became more and 
        more difficult as we grew less flexible. Thanksgiving is all about feeling 
        that for one day there is no change-everything is predictable down to 
        the midnight run to Blockbuster for a movie and the eating of the same 
        traditional dishes year after year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nevertheless, at some point after the salad, but before the pumpkin pie, 
        this illusion of stability is broken, and you just feel let down. Maybe 
        it happened when your sister told a story you weren't part of, or when 
        someone made a private joke that you're out of the loop on, or perhaps 
        it's the fact that although your room looks exactly the same, all of the 
        drawers are empty. Suddenly you realize that the home you carry around 
        with you every day as you cross the quad is different from the physical 
        space you're embodying right at this moment. Perhaps it once was that 
        way you remember, perhaps not, yet the point is that it never will be 
        that again. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It's at this point that you look around and comprehend for the first time 
        the profound connotations and meanings four walls can assume. Home is 
        much more than a location-it's the driveway where I learned to ride a 
        two-wheeler after many scrapes and bruises and later where I crashed my 
        dad's car my first time driving, it's the staircase where my sister and 
        I slid down on our stomachs and later where I walked down for my first 
        date, it's the loft where I spent hours living make-believe camp that 
        now holds pictures and winter clothes. The realization sets in-home and 
        the people there aren't arbitrary, as we change so do they.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Nonetheless, while it's okay to watch yourself grow up, it's sometimes 
        poignant to see others change. Perhaps the greatest paradox of getting 
        older is that you want your parents to stop brushing your hair out of 
        your eyes and let you make your own decisions, yet always be there to 
        give advice when things get rough, you want to go away and create an independent 
        life, yet be able to come back and fit in to your family at anytime, you 
        want to straddle two towns, time zones, coasts, worlds, and ultimately, 
        two lives. And then, when the dishes have been cleared away and you're 
        putting on a coat to go for a family walk, it hits you, as Thomas Wolfe 
        wrote, &quot;you can never go home again&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So the question you ponders while sitting through this year's film selection, 
        &quot;Office Space&quot;, is how to reconcile the home of your memories 
        that you carry with you each day with the house that you inhabit. No one 
        says it better than Oprah, before you laugh at me I must say that her 
        magazine is great, &quot;Home isn't just a residence you purchase or a 
        place you retreat to at the end of the day-it's the sense of yourself 
        that you carry with you no matter where you lay your head.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Thus, this year when the turkey's wrapped up for tomorrow's sandwiches 
        and the movie credits appear on the screen signaling the end of this year's 
        Thanksgiving, look around at your house, your family and friends, and 
        think about what elements of home will be making the trip back to campus 
        with you-what do you choose to keep?</p>
