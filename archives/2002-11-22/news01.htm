        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In a move that signals a new era for the historic Bowdoin 
        campus, the college has selected Philip Enquist of Skidmore, Owings and 
        Merrill, an urban planning partner with the firm that designed the Sears 
        Tower, to create a master plan to guide campus development for the next 
        decade. This is the first time the college has conceived a comprehensive 
        campus plan, according to William Torrey, Bowdoin's top strategic planning 
        official.</p>
      <p>The college is in final contract negotiations with SOM and hopes to reach 
        an agreement within two weeks. Torrey would not comment on the cost, except 
        to say it will be &quot;under a million dollars.&quot; He expects the 
        school will initially work with the campus planners for a year, but expects 
        an ongoing relationship.</p>
      <p>Enquist's selection comes at a time when a college committee is examining 
        how expanding the student population would impact the core mission of 
        the school. President Barry Mills cautioned, however, that the hiring 
        of a campus planner does not mean the college has committed to his proposal 
        to expand the student body by 250.</p>
      <p>&quot;We probably would have [hired a planner] anyway,&quot; Mills said. 
        &quot;The goal is to create a relationship so we can think about future 
        development comprehensively.&quot;</p>
      <p>The move also shows a renewed commitment to creating ambitious architecture, 
        he said. &quot;We have to think about future buildings as important architectural 
        statements that reflect the stature of the institution . . . and that 
        enhance, enable and stand for what our academic life is about. It is vitally 
        important that our facilities support Bowdoin's interdisciplinary nature 
        through their form and function.&quot;</p>
      <p>With the planners, the college will consider its limited options for 
        meeting the facilities needs of the next decade, including the feasibility 
        of relocating the hockey rink to the Farley Fields to free up space for 
        a new academic or residence hall, completing the Stowe-Howard quadrangle 
        by constructing new dormitories, building in the open spaces in front 
        of Chamberlain hall and at the site of the financial aid office on Maine 
        Street.</p>
      <p>The choice of a modernist firm known for drafting black box cityscapes 
        for corporate America rose some eyebrows across campus, but administrators 
        said the hiring was for planning and not individual building contracts, 
        and reflected the strength of the planner himself more than the character 
        of SOM.</p>
      <p>Scott Meiklejohn, a college development officer, said one of the chief 
        pulls of the SOM team was how quickly they grasped Bowdoin's unique challenges 
        as a small college with lots of neighbors. Meiklejohn's own office is 
        tucked beneath the eaves of a converted residence on Federal Street. On 
        his desk sits a copy of a front-page story from the Portland Press-Herald 
        that's headline to a story about the new Psychology building that blares, 
        &quot;Cramped Bowdoin using up its room for growth.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;The firm understands that Bowdoin is a fairly complex place in 
        terms of its relationship with Brunswick,&quot; he said. &quot;We're right 
        here in the middle of a developed neighborhood . . . and our planning 
        challenges are similar to those of a much larger city, a Cambridge or 
        a Chicago.&quot;</p>
      <p>Enquist has worked in both cities. He recently developed the North Campus 
        Plan for Harvard University and engineered the revitalization of Chicago's 
        State Street, &quot;that great street,&quot; in a pursuit to morph the 
        lonely transit mall back into a vibrant urban avenue. </p>
      <p>Jill Pearlman, an architectural historian and Bowdoin professor, hoped 
        SOM's master plan would not eclipse the landscape plan Carol R. Johnson 
        Associates drafted in 1996. &quot;It's a wonderful document with some 
        terrific ideas and I think Bowdoin still has a lot to gain from it. I'd 
        love to see us put in some of the public spaces she has suggested.&quot;</p>
      <p>Mills said the hiring of a campus planner would not sever the college's 
        relationship with Johnson's firm. &quot;We will figure out ways to use 
        both [of the plans] to get the best result for the college.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;In many ways [the campus] is a public trust. The walk across the 
        quad to Massachusetts Hall is what people remember after they graduate,&quot; 
        Mills added. &quot;The campus is a link to our history, to our future. 
        Everything we do has to be respectful of what's here and as ambitious 
        as the college's architecture has been in the past.&quot;</p>
      <p>Torrey noted that creating a campus master plan could preclude a repeat 
        of some past oversights.</p>
      <p>&quot;There had been several mistakes over the previous fifty years that 
        don't leave you with many options today,&quot; he said. &quot;In 1950, 
        Bowdoin was struggling to fill the class - trying to get five hundred 
        men up here in order to survive,&quot; so the school didn't worry so much 
        about its physical makeup.</p>
      <p>&quot;Now we need to think carefully about utilizing space well, about 
        making sure our buildings don't just face inward to the quad . . . that 
        they are as welcoming as they can be, with a face to the town as well,&quot; 
        he said.</p>
      <p>Pearlman was unsure whether, working with a planner, Bowdoin could have 
        avoided mistakes such as dropping the Visual Arts Center in the middle 
        of the college's main entrance. &quot;If you'd hired a master planner 
        at that moment, [the planner] might have loved what [Edward Larrabee] 
        Barnes did. Certainly, planners at that point were promoting the same 
        kind of design sensibility Barnes had to offer,&quot; she said. &quot;What 
        may seem to us great now, may not seem so in a decade or two.&quot;</p>
      <p>SOM was selected by Torrey's committee from among five finalists. Meiklejohn 
        called the vote unanimous. </p>
      <p>The other contenders were Venturi Scott Brown, Sasaki Associates, Philip 
        Caldwell and Wallace Floyd, according to Torrey. </p>
      <p>Pearlman said a good college campus is important for the role it can 
        play in shaping American architecture and society - from the skyline to 
        the strip - for years to come.</p>
      <p>&quot;We've made a mess of much of the physical landscape in the U.S. 
        in the past few decades,&quot; she said. &quot;Drive out to Cook's Corner 
        and you'll see what I mean. Much of our world looks just like it, or worse.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Bowdoin students,&quot; she said, will be among the people &quot;deciding 
        what kind of world we'll live in over the next few decades . . . enlightened 
        citizens of tomorrow [with] a major voice in their communities. If Bowdoin 
        can set an example with its campus of what good planning and design can 
        do, that will contribute mightily to students' education and hopefully, 
        to the future of the communities our students will live in.&quot;</p>
