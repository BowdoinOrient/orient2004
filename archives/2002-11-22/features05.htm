        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">With the gathering storm clouds of another world war far 
        in the distance the members of the Class of 1941 returned to Bowdoin College 
        after a refreshing summer, ready to begin their second year in the fall 
        of 1938. The campus they returned to was quite a different one from the 
        one they had left. Among the additions to Bowdoin's campus were the new 
        statue of a polar bear in front of Sargent Gymnasium and the new sound 
        system in Moulton Union. In his opening address, President Sills noted 
        simply, &quot;the College has never been in better shape to do good work.&quot; 
        A much more interesting addition for the new academic year came in the 
        form of the Class of 1942. One hundred and seventy six members of the 
        new class descended upon the campus that fall. As the freshmen moved into 
        their brick dorms and tried to make sense of college life, a freak weather 
        system struck New England and caused major flooding and hurricane conditions 
        all along the east coast.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin seems to have survived major damage as it got on with its 137th 
        year. Indeed, little seemed to change in the way of traditions. On the 
        football field, Adam Walsh and his Polar Bears were still at the top of 
        their game. The Polar Bears &quot;trounced&quot; Massachusetts State, 
        32-0, in the first game, went on to crush Wesleyan 27-13 a week later, 
        and then beat Williams 14-0. Then, however, a crippling defeat at the 
        hands of Bates (21-0) led the team to halt and regroup. The campus was 
        stunned at the defeat and a new battle cry was heard among the pines and 
        fraternity houses. Wrote the Bowdoin Orient: </p>
      <p align="left">
        Snapping out of its lethargy as if struck by a thunderbolt, the Bowdoin 
        campus once more rises in a spirited backing of the gridmen. Dazed by 
        the suddenness and unexpectedness of last week's defeat at the hands of 
        the Bates Bobcats, the entire Student Body is rapidly working itself into 
        a pitch of feverish excitement for the approaching Maine-Bowdoin football 
        classic which will be held next week end on Whittier Field.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A gigantic rally was planned and staged. Students, faculty, administrators, 
        staff, and alumni joined Brunswick townspeople in a frenzy of football 
        mania. The game against the University of Maine was the largest of the 
        year. In the past Bowdoin had won a mere 15 out of the 40 games played 
        against Maine. A torchlight parade was planned, and along Maine Street 
        Bowdoin men from different generations marched, made noise, lighted flares 
        and heard speeches from such notable guests as Governor Lewis O. Barrows 
        (himself a U. of Maine graduate).</p>
      <p align="left">
        The day of the great showdown came as crowds of both teams met at Whittier 
        Field, prepared for a grand show. The Polar Bears were ready, having been 
        inspired by the outpouring of support from Bowdoin men, past and present. 
        On the field were men like Benny Karsokas '39, Hank Bonzagni '41, and 
        a handsome, friendly young man from Methuen, Massachusetts by the name 
        of Andrew Allison Haldane '41. Tall, with short, dark-brown hair, and 
        a heavy jaw that had the tendency to push his lips into a proud smile, 
        Haldane would rise to become the captain of the football team his senior 
        year while also serving as the President of the Student Council. A graduate 
        of Methuen High School and Bridgton Academy, he would also be voted the 
        most popular man in his class during spring of his junior year. After 
        Bowdoin, he returned to help coach the freshman football team and then 
        went on to become a Marine officer. The skills that Haldane would use 
        on the field of battle he partially learned at Bowdoin. Called &quot;Handy-Andy&quot; 
        by the Orient he was responsible for a large number of Polar Bear scores. 
        On this field, on this day, against Bowdoin's rival, he was on the field 
        again. A leader and a determined soldier, Haldane must have felt both 
        nervous and thrilled when the crowds roared with chants of &quot;Bowdoin, 
        Bowdoin, Bowdoin!&quot; As songs began to fill the air and as the clapping 
        rose to a pitch, the ball was thrown forward; moving bodies began to get 
        in position. A thousand things happened on the field and, as the ball 
        fell forwards, out of the sky towards the opening arms of a player, there 
        were even more movements, actions. Confusion, disorder, pressure, heat-all 
        these elements blended into one. Andy Haldane loved that feeling and as 
        the ball headed towards him, he did what was in his nature to always do-he 
        headed for where the action was hottest.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At the end of the day, victory was Bowdoin's. The ten thousand in attendance 
        got the &quot;thrill-packed&quot; game they asked for, the Polar Bears 
        proved themselves yet again and the final score of 13-6 made Bowdoin's 
        defeat earlier that year a mere memory. News of this great victory was 
        reported in the Bowdoin Orient on November 9, 1938. That same night, across 
        the Atlantic Ocean in Germany, a country slowly being consumed by a dark 
        hatred as old as time itself, there was terror. Nazi troopers, along with 
        secret police, the Gestapo, and other anti-Semitic elements, began a night 
        of burning and looting Jewish homes and businesses. Almost one hundred 
        Jews were murdered, and thousands more were sent to concentration camps. 
        Along the dark corridors and passages of the German nation men with guns 
        broke into homes, harassed civilians, and did the bidding of their f&uuml;hrer. 
        This was November 9th, 1938, the Night of the Broken Glass - Kristallnacht. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Events in Germany did not go unnoticed by the world community, and members 
        of Bowdoin College watched in horror as the persecution of Jews continued. 
        President Sills commented that &quot;At times it seems that some accounts 
        must be exaggerated, yet all testimony shows that there has not been such 
        cruel treatment of so many people since the Middle Ages.&quot; In the 
        middle of November the College supported a lecture by Dr. Kirby Page, 
        who spoke on the problems that faced the world. Page gave some of his 
        views concerning possible peaceful solutions and cautioned that another 
        war would result in the destruction of humanity. While President Sills 
        probably agreed with many of Page's points, his view was less pessimistic 
        and more focused on the present. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On November 20, the President, in Chapel, advocated a new foreign policy 
        for the United States. Sills' basic message was that the U.S. should reconsider 
        its tight restrictions on refugees seeking asylum, stating, &quot;No doubt 
        the opening of our doors would involve sacrifice and inconvenience, but 
        it would be mockery if we, a democratic nation, should shut our doors 
        to refugees.&quot; From Germany, a Bowdoin voice was heard in the form 
        of James Wallace Blunt, Jr. '40. From Munich, where he was studying away, 
        Blunt wrote to the Orient describing the differences between the German 
        and U.S. educational systems. &quot;I have found,&quot; Blunt wrote, &quot;that 
        most of the things that I heard about Germany weren't true.&quot; Commenting 
        on the political situation he noted:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Also the people aren't blind in belief in the administration. They, too, 
        see weak points; but, as a whole, they realize that what they have now 
        is better than what they had before. The situation here is very interesting 
        and I don't think we in America know enough about the geography and history 
        of the country to criticize it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On campus there were plenty of issues to deal with. In the previous academic 
        year Sills had campaigned for less hazing and more acceptance among the 
        college body , aiming his comments at the fraternity system. In this new 
        year, the fraternities struck back. Not wanting to be considered old and 
        obsolete, they tried to regain their stature by helping to put on a Christmas 
        party for hundreds of Brunswick children. Someone, dressed up like Santa 
        Claus, helped distribute prizes, candy, ice cream, and food to the visitors 
        as fraternity members along with the Thorndike Club and other College 
        organizations lended a hand to the successful event. The Orient noted 
        that the Christmas party would, &quot;help convince critical individuals 
        that the fraternity still means what its name implies. The fraternities 
        at Bowdoin as well as the College itself have shown that theirs is a community 
        interest.&quot; Wrote James E. Tracy, Jr. '39:</p>
      <p align="left">
        And so, one more step has been taken by Bowdoin to make the town a better 
        friend than she has been previously, a step larger and greater than any 
        of the former, but certainly not the last. Let us hope that the grand 
        efforts toward this end will not be undone by a repetition of the &quot;barbarism 
        and vandalism&quot; which has been only too evident on past &quot;Proc&quot; 
        nights and Rising Days.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Rising Day, however, continued to be a headache for the College this year. 
        A determined group of freshmen from the Class of 1942 barricaded themselves 
        on the top floor of Maine Hall. There, equipped with buckets of water, 
        they held out against attacks by the sophomores for almost one hour. &quot;With 
        the dawn,&quot; wrote the Orient, &quot;came peace and cherished memories 
        of the rooms that used to be.&quot; Water was the weapon of choice for 
        that year; sophomores retrieved a fire-hose and opened a spray of water 
        on unsuspecting first-years who were exiting the Chapel. Despite this 
        savage assault by the sophomores the freshmen claimed a victory and proclaimed 
        their independence from the tyranny of their older brothers.</p>
      <p align="left">
        That year, in the Baccalaureate Address, President Sills bid farewell 
        to the graduating Class of 1939, warning them that there was a war already 
        being fought. &quot;Mars is in the saddle not only where there is active 
        warfare,&quot; he noted, &quot;but in peaceful hills and remote valleys 
        where the sound of the forging of arms comes crashing through.&quot; Among 
        other things, Sills was referring to the growing belligerence of the German 
        war machine and the timidity of the Allied leaders. On March 15, 1939 
        Hitler's troops completely occupied the neighboring country of Czechoslovakia. 
        At the end of September of the previous year, Sudetenland-a part of Czechoslovakia-had 
        been ceded to Germany. This time, Hitler wanted the whole country. He 
        gained the support of the German people themselves through propaganda 
        and swift, decisive action. Jim Blunt '40 wrote from Germany that on his 
        way to school one day he noticed a long time of trucks, tanks and artillery 
        on the roads, headed for Germany's eastern border. With the military in 
        place there was one more move to make. Blunt observed that &quot;every 
        German subjects himself to the Government propaganda machine in two ways 
        every day, since both press and radio are government-owned.&quot; With 
        these tools in their hands, the government &quot;filled the radio programs 
        with talk of Germans being under Czechish terrorism,&quot; Blunt wrote. 
        Mile by mile, day by day, Hitler and his armies were growing more confident. 
        Kenneth Sills was one of the people who saw this and attempted to warn 
        his graduating class of such a threat:</p>
      <p align="left">
        On solemn occasions such as this it would be well for the oncoming generation 
        to realize the task before them, that of remaking a badly shattered world 
        and of facing the difficulties without yielding to a defeatist attitude. 
        Democracy, in which we all in theory believe, is being harshly assailed 
        by foes from within and by forces from without; both of these are dangerous; 
        both must be resisted. &#133; In the careless, happy go lucky yet altogether 
        busy days of your college life I wonder if you have reflected enough on 
        your American heritage. I wonder if perhaps you have not, like the majority 
        of us, taken too much for granted that the liberty won for us by our fathers 
        will continue on no matter how careless or how indifferent we may be. 
        &#133; You may said, &quot;I cannot do much,&quot; but remember the words 
        of Herbert Spencer, &quot;How infinitesimal is the importance of anything 
        I can do, but how infinitely important it is that I should do it.&quot; 
        In a world where bitterness and intolerance seem to be increasing I trust 
        you have learned from Bowdoin and from your fellowship at Bowdoin the 
        difference between prejudice and conviction, the necessity of treating 
        every one of God's children as a human being, with the dignity and independence 
        inherent in man. &#133; Along that road you must travel, as indeed along 
        that road the world must travel if the present destructive chaos is ever 
        to end. But be not dismayed. If today men of good will in every nation 
        are crying out. &quot;How long, O Lord, how long?&quot; remember that 
        the things that can be shaken will pass away so that the things that cannot 
        be shaken may remain.</p>
