      <p align="left"> Behold the power of fantasy, that dream-weaver who slays 
        worries with a whisper, that champion of far off looks and deep sighs. 
        In <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcero's Stone</i>, the first of the Harry 
        Potter series, the film made you grin so broadly it was embarrassing. 
        It brought out the kid in you-the kid who looks wide-eyed at a display 
        window in one of those old Christmas flicks, the kid who contemplates 
        silly things like why no one thought to make Bowdoin a big castle with 
        moving staircases, and how cool it would be to ride to class on broomsticks. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> The second installment of the series, <i>Harry Potter and 
        the Chamber of Secrets</i>, only widens the fantastical realm of the first. 
        It opened last weekend with a bang, selling out shows days in advance 
        and driving theater employees nationwide out of their minds-all so millions 
        of devoted fans could finally see what they had previously only imagined: 
        Harry's heroic adventures in his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft 
        and Wizardy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After having been rescued from his miserable existence at the Dursleys', 
        and living for a while with the Weasleys in their magical home, Harry 
        Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) plans to return to Hogwarts for another year 
        but a pesky house elf, Dobby, warns him that he is in danger and must 
        not go back. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ignoring him, Harry returns to the school, where, true enough, something 
        terrible does happen: the Chamber of Secrets, built by the founding muggle-hating 
        wizard Salazar Slytherin, is opened. Students are being attacked and Harry 
        is the main suspect. However, with the help of his friends Ron Weasley 
        (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), matured with the wisdom 
        of his headmaster Albus Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris) and the gamekeeper 
        Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Harry uncovers the mystery of the chamber 
        and saves Hogwarts from the forces out to destroy it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Director Christopher Columbus took on the daunting task of adapting the 
        widely-read novel to the satisfaction of its fans a second time, and within 
        the limits of Hollywood-the three hour time limit and a preference of 
        action over content-he succeeded. His only shortcoming is not going deep 
        enough into what is one of the greatest stories ever written. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, that's a given; you simply can't fit a 341 page narrative masterpiece 
        into three hours of film. You could probably fit it into five or six, 
        but according to Hollywood, who tends to see the public as a herd of mindless 
        cattle, our butts would start to hurt too much after sitting for that 
        long and we'd wander off to newer pastures. So there goes any chance of 
        the film being as good as the book.</p>
      <p align="left"> That out of the way, this movie still rocked. First, let's 
        talk characters. Kenneth Branagh made a fabulous Gilderoy Lockhart, the 
        supremely egotistical Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. I'm sure 
        he was cast based on his performance in <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, 
        easily his most eccentric and hilarious Shakespeare role. </p>
      <p align="left"> Another newcomer to Harry's world is Lucius Malfoy, father 
        of Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), played by Jason Issacs (<i>The 
        Tuxedo</i>, <i>The Patriot</i>). I never thought he would look so deliciously 
        evil with platinum blond hair tied in a ribbon, but he did. And he's got 
        the evil squinting sneer down.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As for the old trio of youung protagonists-Harry, his friend Ron, and 
        Hermione-there's really nothing quite as authentic as watching the actors 
        grow up along with their characters. Harry's voice has deepened since 
        last year, Ron's squeaks, and Hermione's hair-well, I think her hair got 
        longer, anyway. </p>
      <p align="left">
        None of these kids could be called great actors on their own merit-Rupert 
        Grint had only acted in an elementary school play before being cast as 
        Ron-but luckily the screenplay didn't ask for much of it. They are as 
        we imagined them, and that is all that matters. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Selecting which scenes from the book to show in the given screen time 
        must have been tough for the filmmakers, but it got a heck of a lot easier 
        once they decided that a lot of action was cooler than a broken story. 
        Harry gets beat up by a giant tree, is almost killed by a rogue Quidditch 
        bludger (see book for definitions), barely escapes from an army of giant, 
        and very hungry, spiders, and then, of course, is left to battle the final 
        monster alone, as the hero destined for greatness. </p>
      <p align="left">
        All in all, this is an incredibly entertaining, well-made film for both 
        bookworms and pure moviegoers alike. It also keeps us hard core fans Harry-happy 
        until the much-anticipated release of the fifth book next spring, and 
        the third film in 2004. The saga continues&#133; </p>
