        <font size="2">JAMES BAUMBERGER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> When the staff at Moulton Dining Hall displayed a sign 
        indicating that the paper cups would soon be removed, they probably did 
        not expect that such an innocuous issue would spark student debate over 
        the rationality of Bowdoin's environmentally friendly policies. But, nevertheless, 
        it did. To some, the decision to remove the cups was an intolerable injustice. 
        To others, including me, the decision was perfectly reasonable and long 
        overdue.</p>
      <p align="left">Under the new policy, students wanting to take their coffee 
        or tea to-go would have to bring their own reusable mug. This would virtually 
        eliminate the 200,000 paper cups Bowdoin uses each year. At the current 
        rate, 2 million cups would be added to the landfill over the next decade. 
        This amount of waste is certainly not an insufficient cause for action.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A letter to the editor in last week's Orient urged me to &quot;shout out 
        in protest&quot; of this blatant and unjust violation of my rights. After 
        I finished reading the letter, I did want to shout out, but certainly 
        not in protest of phasing out the cups as suggested.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Last week's letter claimed that the decision was made by Keisha Payson 
        of Sustainable Bowdoin, that Ms. Payson stood to benefit financially from 
        the plan, and that the initiative was not student led. Had the authors 
        taken the time to research the issue, they would have known that all of 
        these insulting assumptions were factually incorrect.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Their characterization of Ms. Payson as a greedy tyrant was as inaccurate 
        as it was unfair. While she did support the effort, getting rid of the 
        paper cups was not her idea, nor was it her decision to make. The staff 
        at Moulton made the decision after they agreed with a letter sent to them 
        by a student from the Sustainable Bowdoin Reduce and Reuse Subcommittee 
        who proposed the idea as a way to cut back on unnecessary waste. Lastly, 
        the implication that Ms. Payson was in a position to profit from the decision 
        was yet another ill-informed statement. Only the dining service would 
        reap the financial benefits of removing the cups.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The purpose of this policy was to reduce the impact of Bowdoin's waste 
        on the environment and to keep costs down, one of many small steps to 
        prevent large tuition increases. Success of the program would not, therefore, 
        need to be judged on the basis of overwhelming student support. History 
        has taught us that if something is the right thing to do, it does not 
        necessarily matter that some disagree with it.</p>
      <p align="left">
        And where is all this student rage anyway? Where is the backlash? No one 
        showed up for a proposed march on Moulton to protest the new policy. Off 
        the top of my head, I can think of at least a thousand better reasons 
        to stage a protest march. I think the Bowdoin students realize that the 
        good this type of policy does for the community outweighs the minor inconvenience.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I agree with the authors that relying on individual prudence is best in 
        these matters, but prudence has failed to work. After a year of urging 
        students to take their hot drinks in reusable mugs, paper cup usage in 
        the dining halls has only increased. Obviously, new solutions are needed. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The only valid argument against the removal of the cups is the inconvenience 
        of it, a point made only peripherally in the letter. But is bringing a 
        reusable mug to the dining hall really an &quot;unreasonable burden,&quot; 
        as they contend? I believe this is a gross exaggeration, and I think common 
        sense supports me on this one.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As it stands now, Moulton has put off implementing the plan until a consensus 
        is heard. So drop a note in the suggestion box. Let them know that it's 
        not just the dissenters who have an opinion.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I urge the staff at Moulton and Thorne Dining Halls to follow their intuition 
        and do what is right for our community.</p>
