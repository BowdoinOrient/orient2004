            Persia</i>, a play based on creation myths, written and directed by 
            Bobak Bakhtiari '03. (Karsten Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Bobak Bakhtiari '03 knows something about gods and monsters. 
        Both feature prominently in the characters and myths explored in his production 
        <i>Eyes of Persia</i>, which premieres at Bowdoin's Wish Theater this 
        weekend. But the presence of these Gods and Monsters reached beyond the 
        confines of Eyes' storyline, making themselves felt as a force in the 
        production's creation. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you ask Bakhtiari's dedicated tech crew, of all the monsters Bakhtiari 
        conjures up in Eyes, none is more pervasive than the production itself. 
        They watched with a combination of dismay and awe as the senior fused 
        music, dance, narrative, and almost two dozen Bowdoin students into a 
        90-minute mythical odyssey. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Along the way, Bakhtiari wove in themes of Zoroastrian creation myths, 
        paganism, and contemporary Islamic culture. Things did not always run 
        smoothly. But as Bakhtiari said, &quot;You try to say something about 
        the gods&#133;&quot; And yes, sometimes, you are going to incur their 
        wrath-though mostly in the form of minor injuries to his sprawling cast. 
        </p>
      <p align="left"> You might also feel the gods smile on you, and reward you 
        with inspiration. It was only two months ago, well into Bakhtiari's development 
        of the play, that he started noticing relevant <i>New York Times</i> articles 
        dealing with the role of Islam in contemporary Iran. Bakhtiari included 
        these brief glimpses of contemporary Iranian life at its most extreme, 
        weaving them seamlessly into the flow of his original narrative. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bakhtiari explains that the play was changing and developing all the way 
        up to Thursday's dress rehearsal. &quot;It wasn't quite a work-shopped 
        play, but it was so heavily dependent on the actor's abilities and intensities, 
        that it had to grow to fit the particular individuals I had in each role.&quot; 
        The students became a part of Bakhtiari's vision, bringing everything 
        from his movement, to the costumes and lighting-setups, to life. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The performance opens with a young girl playing in a courtyard in Iran. 
        She hums softly, rolling marbles, lulling you with the quiet serenity 
        of the setting, when, BAM! All of a sudden she runs away and is replaced 
        by a nine-foot-tall creature draped in red battling a leotard clad gymnastic 
        whirlwind, as white figures flutter about playfully. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bakhtiari's play demonstrates the immediacy of myth and ritual in our 
        life as the gorgeously costumed displays of pagan revelry and warring 
        fantastical beasts melt into the scenes of a father retelling these stories 
        to his daughter. His infectious enthusiasm fills these frightening beasts 
        with a spirit of wonder and beauty, even as they elicit gasps from the 
        audience. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But even with their soundtrack of tormented screams and ear warping wails, 
        the monsters are by no means the most frightening part of Bakhtiari's 
        works. It turns out the villainy they inspire is no match for the tyranny 
        of humans, and Bakhtiari holds up frightening evidence of this, both couched 
        in surreal myth, and starkly drawn from the pages of present-day journalism. 
        </p>
      <p align="left"> Bakhtiari was born in Iran, and returned there briefly 
        before beginning work on his play last February. He was inspired by the 
        need to express &quot;something raw and really organic that was sort of 
        seeping through&quot; him. The stories that form the backbone of Eyes 
        are not obscure texts, but a living part of Iranian culture. Bakhtiari 
        explained their significance and prevalence in Iranian culture as being 
        similar to &quot;what beer means to Americans.&quot; However disgruntled 
        some Americans might be by this frightening characterization of their 
        values, the gods are most pleased with Bakhtiari's <i>Eyes of Persia</i>, 
        the monster of a play he made beautiful. </p>
      <p align="left"> <i>Eyes of Persia</i> opens Friday Night at 7:00 p.m. in 
        Wish Theater. Some tickets are still available at the door.</p>
