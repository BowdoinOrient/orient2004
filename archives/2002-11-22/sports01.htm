        of 35 teams in the New England Division III Championship at Westfield 
        State last Saturday. The top four teams--Keene State, Bowdoin, Williams,

      <p align="left">Keene State, winner of last year's regional race, repeated 
        their championship with 64 points. Bowdoin (111 points) matched last year's 
        second place NE D III finish. The two other national qualifiers, Williams 
        and Connecticut College, tallied 132 and 151 points respectively. Trinity, 
        Tufts, MIT, Bates, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and Wesleyan rounded out 
        the top ten teams.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bowdoin Men showed a mastery of the Westfield State course en route 
        to their impressive second place finish. Bowdoin's first runner, co-captain 
        and 2001 All-American Todd Forsgren '03, finished in ninth place with 
        a time of 25:02 followed by co-captain Pat Vardaro '03 (twenty-second 
        place in 25:26). Scott Barbuto '03 was twenty-fourth overall, and clocked 
        an impressive 25:32, despite running with a pulled calf muscle. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Senior co-captain Jeff Rubens, twenty-fifth place, finished less than 
        one second behind Barbuto. Junior Scott Herrick, thirty-first place, ran 
        a personal best 25:46 over the slushy five mile course. Bowdoin's NCAA 
        Championship berth was solidified by thirty eighth place Dan Gulotta '03, 
        who ran a personal best of 25:55. Seventh-man sophomore sensation Ben 
        Peisch took forty-sixth place in 26:04.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After the race, the team was treated to a feast at the home of Dan Gulotta 
        in Sheffield, Massachusetts. The weary and excited runners were recharged 
        after dining on roasted venison.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After the race, Head Coach Peter Slovenski commented on what will be the 
        final chapter for the five seniors running at nationals tomorrow: &quot;This 
        has been the best class of distance runners in Bowdoin history. We have 
        seven exceptional senior runners who each bring some championship qualities 
        to the lineup.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Slovenski elaborated, &quot;Todd gives us poise and nerves of steel in 
        the championship races. Pat has wonderful passion for the team and the 
        school. Scott Barbuto makes us more intelligent in races, and Jeff Rubens 
        has made us more dedicated in our training. Conor O'Brien helps keep us 
        steady and persistent, while Dan Gulotta complements that by being our 
        most unpredictable and dangerous runner. Alex Moore brings an excellent 
        sense of humor and wit to the program.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It has been a fantastic group that brought two consecutive NESCAC 
        cross-country championships to Bowdoin. They have the character to finish 
        as one of the top ten teams in Division III this weekend.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Forsgren noted how the men's team has not yet reached its peak potential: 
        &quot;Second place in New England is certainly something the team should 
        be very proud of. A lot of the guys had great races, with five of us gaining 
        all New England honors. We've been looking forward to nationals all year 
        and I think our best race is yet to come.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Coach Slovenski shared Forsgren's view: &quot;We had an excellent race 
        in the regional, but we have been pointing to the national race all season. 
        We'll run even better this weekend. We've been preparing for nationals 
        all summer and fall.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Vardaro agreed and was pleased that the women's team was making the trip 
        with the men: &quot;The high point of the day at Westfield was when we 
        found out that the women had not only qualified for NCAAs, but had pulled 
        off a huge upset by coming in third. Having both teams at nationals is 
        almost certainly going to boost our performance.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The seven-man squad, which departed for Minnesota yesterday, looks to 
        set the Bowdoin College record for the highest finish by any sports team 
        in a NCAA Championship. The 1994 Bowdoin Women's Cross-Country team currently 
        holds this honor with their sixth place finish in the NCAA Championship. 
        The Bowdoin men finished 11th in their trip to nationals last year and 
        are ranked ninth in the latest NCAA coaching poll.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Co-captain Conor O'Brien '03 explained the mystique of nationals: &quot;It's 
        like a big dance. You think all that counts is getting invited. But if 
        it's going to be a night to remember you better dress well and make all 
        the right moves.&quot;</p>
