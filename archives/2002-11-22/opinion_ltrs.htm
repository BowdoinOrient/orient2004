      <p align="left"><font size="5">Security should notify ticketed students</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> About a month ago I mistakenly parked in the blue section of the Farley 
        lot. I returned to my car five days later, and by then two tickets were 
        sitting on my windshield. Technically, I should have been towed. Regardless, 
        it must have been obvious to the security officer that I had not been 
        back to my car since the first ticket was issued.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Similarly, my friend's car was towed from Bowdoin grounds last Monday 
        morning. He was never notified that it was sitting in the impound lot 
        for $50 a day; luckily, he happened to need it the next day, discovering 
        the situation before it got too expensive. Why couldn't someone in Security 
        have let him know that his car was being taken away?</p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact is that many students leave their cars parked and untouched for 
        days, even weeks, at a time. But without communication between Security 
        and students, one parking blunder has the potential to cost hundreds of 
        dollars-a bill that (incredibly!) not all of our parents will pay. It 
        seems fair that students, especially non-egregious parking offenders, 
        should be alerted to parking citations before they get out of hand.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now I'm not suggesting that Security be relegated to a babysitting service, 
        cleaning up our parking messes while we run around willy-nilly. And I'm 
        not even suggesting that Security has an obligation to tell students before 
        they are ticketed. I am suggesting that Security adopt a policy whereby 
        they inform violators-by phone or email-the day a citation is given. A 
        simple heads-up from the office would allow students to act quickly to 
        fix the problem before ridiculous charges are racked up, thus saving us 
        hundreds of dollars a month. It would also reduce the number of embittered 
        souls ranting to the people at the garage in West Bath or poor Pauline 
        in the Security office.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Obviously, Security is not out to get students, or to make a quick buck. 
        But they now have the power to prove that they are indeed working for 
        the students by initiating what would be a much-appreciated courtesy. 
        This is a golden opportunity for increased communication between Security 
        and students, and it could be a first step toward alleviating some of 
        this school's parking headaches. Otherwise, this winter has the potential 
        to be a long and expensive one for Bowdoin drivers.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I write this letter to the Orient, although the article in question appeared 
        in the Patriot, because I think the Orient has wider readership.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Gilman Barndollar wrote in the Patriot that liberals were blind to communisms 
        evils and went along with communism. Some did, particularly at the beginning 
        of the 20s and in the Popular Front period and the worst days of the Depression. 
        A few, like Pete Seeger or Paul Robeson stayed with the party. But most 
        did not. Some otherwise liberal unions expelled the communists in the 
        20s. With the Moscow purge trials in the mid 30s and the apparent incipient 
        success of the New Deal in fighting the Depression, the CPUSA withered. 
        John Dewey led an investigating group that concluded that Stalin had ordered 
        Trutsky's murder. Several important black intellectuals toyed briefly 
        with the CPUSA, but like Richard Wright (or the protagonist in Ellison's 
        Invisible Man) were quickly disillusioned. The NAACP was careful to steer 
        clear of communist involvement, even in such a high-profile case as that 
        of the Scottsboro Boys. CPers were very effective union organizers, but 
        the AFL-CIO expelled communists in the late 1940s Liberal Senator Hubert 
        Humphrey was a strong anti-communist, and of course the only actual hot 
        wars against communism were fought by liberal presidents. In New York, 
        when the CP took over the American Labor Party, liberals left and formed 
        the Liberal Party. When, in 1948, Henry Wallace's Progressive Party was 
        taken over by the communists, most liberals left and voted for Truman. 
        The Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) was formed by intellectuals 
        like Sidney Hook and Arthur Schlesinger jr. as a liberal but anti-communist 
        organization.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Liberals did protest against the actions of Senator Joseph McCarthy and 
        his imitators. This enabled some conservatives to accuse them of favoring 
        communism. Many liberals criticized the size of American military expenditures 
        during the Cold War, particularly the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. 
        This enabled some conservatives to accuse liberals of favoring communism. 
        Many liberals did oppose the Vietnam War, which enabled some conservatives 
        to accuse them of favoring communism. Obviously neither opposing McCarthy 
        or U.S. nuclear stockpiles or the Vietnam War imply sympathy with communism.

        There is a huge bibliography on these issues. A good brief introduction 
        is John Diggins's The American Left in the Twentieth Century, which is 
        from 1973. I would be glad to provide additional scholarly references.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Cup policy was a student-led initiative</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I am writing in response to last week's letter by Pat Rockefeller, James 
        Weeks, Henry Brennan, and Joseph Brazzi. In their letter, they describe 
        the &quot;small tyrannies&quot; and &quot;injustices&quot; carried out 
        by Sustainable Bowdoin in their effort to remove paper cups from Moulton 
        Dining Hall. As a member of Sustainable Bowdoin, I intend to correct several 
        errors made by Rockefeller and company.</p>
      <p align="left">
        First, the writers indicate that this campaign might have been acceptable 
        if it had been a student led initiative. Had they actually researched 
        the issue, they would have found that this campaign was not &quot;dictatorially&quot; 
        executed by Sustainable Bowdoin leader Keisha Payson, but was rather suggested 
        and agreed upon by over 20 members of Sustainable Bowdoin, all of who 
        are students here at Bowdoin College. I am the person who asked Moulton 
        to put this idea into practice. While I had Keisha's support, I want to 
        make it clear that this was, in fact, a student led initiative.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second issue I would like to address is the economic relevance of 
        this initiative. If the writers of last week's letter are not persuaded 
        by the economics of this issue, then perhaps it is because this initiative 
        is not economically driven. Sustainable Bowdoin's interest in this issue 
        was purely environmental, with the added bonus that the dining hall would 
        save $4,000.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Lastly I would like to comment on the letter itself. The lack of research 
        alone makes the entry reprehensible. The insinuations that the reach of 
        Sustainable Bowdoin is approaching a tyranny and that Keisha executed 
        this idea without student input and for personal gain indicate a degree 
        of immaturity that I am appalled to find at an institution such as Bowdoin.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the removal of the paper cups will not tip the scales of global 
        paper consumption, this is a tiny step that we at Bowdoin can take to 
        help reduce the demand on the world's forests. Our goals may be small, 
        but I think it is important that we make efforts to improve our relationship 
        with the environment. Our only alternative is inaction. I'm sure there 
        are many students who share my interest in doing what we can, and I think 
        it is unfortunate that a few detractors are the only ones making their 
        voices heard.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Rockefeller et al., it would behoove you to do some research before libeling 
        your fellow community members.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="4"></a>Know who you're voting for</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">In last week's Orient, Michael Saur, a recent grad, wrote 
        in response to my article about voting not being a cure for apathy, or 
        a substitute for civic engagement. My conclusion was that those who are 
        apathetic, don't understand the issues, and really don't care should not 
        be harassed about voting. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Saur accuses me of writing this because I do not want liberals to vote. 
        To defend this death-defying leap of logic, he puts aside those critical 
        skills he learned at Bowdoin and ignores the fact that no mention of ideology, 
        party identification or constituency was present in my article. He instead 
        subscribes to the Miss-Cleo-psychic-hotline school of thought and merely 
        hypothesizes my intent. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Saur also pulls out the boogey-man of all secular thought, invoking the 
        haunting image of the-gasp-Christian Coalition, although I am about as 
        agnostic as one can be. I can see the hamster running on the wheel right 
        now-hmmm&#133;Rockefeller is a conservative; therefore, everything he 
        writes is a subconscious attempt to promote the Religious Right and undermine 
        the Democratic Party on behalf of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Stick to the text, Mike. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Next, he concludes, &quot;By voting, a person has ceased, at least to 
        an extent, to be apathetic.&quot; If spending four minutes to walk into 
        a polling station and pull a lever constitutes &quot;ceasing to be apathetic,&quot; 
        perhaps Saur is correct. This does not mean that they are in the least 
        bit educated about what they are voting for or against, and if this is 
        the extent of their participation in the political process then it is 
        a sad day for democracy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Most ridiculous, however, is Saur's conclusion. He finishes with, &quot;I 
        choose to exercise my right to vote&#133;and I am terribly sorry if my 
        personal decisions at the polls might not mirror Mr. Rockefeller's own.&quot; 
        The point was never that people didn't have a right to vote or had to 
        agree with me; on the contrary, I made it quite clear that people did 
        have a right to vote any way they wanted, but that it came with a responsibility. 
        To conclude with a sarcastic remark about his not agreeing with me, which 
        was premised on his own conjecture, and not something I ever wrote, shows 
        that Saur was never really interested in the arguments, and merely reacted 
        with knee-jerk criticism, misrepresenting my words and never offering 
        a true argument of his own.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="5"></a>Democrats belong on the left</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> Todd Buell is wrong. Moving right is the last thing the Democrats need 
        to do. Why did Nader get so many votes in 2000? Because many people perceived 
        the two-party system as a two-headed monster, and didn't want to choose 
        &quot;the lesser of two evils.&quot; Thanks to Nader's strong showing, 
        the election was close enough that the ruthless Republican party was able 
        to steal it with some help from the Supreme Court, whose members should 
        be impeached for that ridiculous misuse of power.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Buell advises that the Democratic party should try to attract back the 
        &quot;Reagan Democrats,&quot; who would give valuable numbers of votes 
        but who are against such things as abortion rights and marijuana legalization, 
        viewing them as &quot;morally wrong.&quot; Why would the Democrats want 
        these people in their fold? America is overwhelmingly pro-choice. Republicans 
        are split on the issue, but the religious right holds a lot of power in 
        their party, so the Democrats are, at least on the national level, the 
        party of abortion rights. Why abandon such a popular position? </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Democrats are having an identity crisis, and they need to show the 
        strong differences between the parties. These same Republicans who are 
        morally against abortion are morally for &quot;the right to bear arms,&quot; 
        which leads to the death of people who have actually been born and can 
        think. The Second Amendment needs to be repealed. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The right is also routinely against freedom of speech in the name of &quot;family 
        values.&quot; Unfortunately, this is one position that the Gores and Joe 
        Lieberman are also misguided on, as they crusade against music and movies. 
        Censorship is wrong in all cases; free speech is the most important thing 
        about America and should be ultimate. Eminem should be allowed to say 
        whatever he wants in his songs. I should be able to stand on a corner 
        in D.C. and say I'm going to shoot the President without being jailed. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        To have a chance in 2004 and beyond, the Democrats need to grow some balls 
        and stand up against President Shrub and his corrupt regime. They didn't 
        even challenge the Republican incumbents for House and Senate in my voting 
        district in Virginia; I ended up writing myself in on the ballot. The 
        Republicans now control the Presidency and both houses, so the governing 
        of the nation is their responsibility, giving the Democrats freedom to 
        dissent. Bush has made war and terrorism political, you can do the same-criticize 
        the mishandling of the situation and decrying the degradation of the country 
        into a police state in the name of security. I'm ready to fight a revolution 
        if it comes to that. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And in 2004, there's rage against this cowboy's record of raping the environment, 
        and strongly promoting seeking alternative energies. We wouldn't be so 
        involved in the whole Middle East mess in the first place if we weren't 
        so reliant on the region for feeding our oil addiction. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Follow your liberal hearts. In the words of James Carville, &quot;We're 
        right, they're wrong.&quot;</p>
