            <p align="left">Taylor Astaire Washburn grew up in the safe haven of Amherst, Massachusetts.  He began running during middle school, and helped mold his traditionally average high school team into a perennial state contender.  Success was not cheap for young Washburn, however.  During his junior campaign, he suffered a broken collarbone during a race, and later that year he underwent knee surgery, preventing him from running for nine months.  Nonetheless, his desire to compete in collegiate athletics prompted him to come running to Bowdoin.</p>
<p align="left">	"I knew I wanted to go to a small liberal arts college," said Washburn. </p>
<p align="left">"This was primarily for academic reasons, but it was also due in part to my interest in competing in DIII athletics. I liked the fact that the Bowdoin cross-country team had been consistently a powerhouse.  I'm [also] a die-hard New Englander, so Maine seemed like a perfect place to go to college." </p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, Washburn's first two years competing for Bowdoin were hampered by a persistent stress fracture, forcing him to spend hours rehabbing in the pool instead of running.   Washburn responded to these setbacks by averaging over 100 miles per week the summer before his junior year.  He started his junior season strong, dominating the field at the University of New England Invitational and placing ninth at the Maine State Meet before he was overtaken by mononucleosis.  Washburn continued to train even with the illness, and made a remarkable comeback during the spring season.  He placed 11th in the 10,000 meters at the New England Championships despite not being able to train at full capacity.</p>
<p align="left">One would think that these setbacks would have dampened his desire over the years, but teammate Aaron Goldstein '05 insists the opposite is true.</p>
<p align="left">"Taylor is a remarkably well-read gentleman, and his personal discovery of the writings of Epictetus and the other Stoic philosophers helped him to overcome his difficult circumstances," said Goldstein. </p>
<p align="left">"Epictetus wrote mostly from prison, and Taylor spent a lot of time in the pool, which is pretty much the lower bastion of hell if you're a runner.  In that sense, he could relate to the Stoics, and that helped him to get more focused than ever.  Now that he's at full strength, we're expecting great things from him."</p>
<p align="left">Washburn's attitude towards running has improved in many different ways.   Rather than trying to run "more miles than everybody else," Washburn has developed a greater appreciation for his craft and honed his training to maximize results without putting his body at risk.  </p>
<p align="left">"One thing I've learned in the last couple years is that running is more than just times on a stopwatch. The act of racing itself - whether you're out in front or in the middle of the pack - can be an intensely rewarding experience. It's painful and requires real mental strength and grit. You don't get that feeling from anything else on a daily basis," Washburn explained.</p>
<p align="left">"Training is the same way; going out and running or doing a hard workout makes me feel more worthwhile. My injuries have helped me appreciate [that] the spirit of a true runner can't be reduced to times and ribbons alone - it's about what you put into it and what you get out of it. That being said, however, there are some guys I really want to beat."</p>
<p align="left">Now entering his senior season for the team, Washburn is injury-free and determined to make his mark in Bowdoin cross-country history as a runner, student, and team captain.  He has one of the best academic records on the team and is weighing his law school options.  In addition, he has the athletic talent and leadership that the team needs after losing all of its captains and five top runners from last year's NESCAC championship team.  </p>
<p align="left">Washburn knows that his fellow runners will need his gutsy performances as well as his experience and leadership in order to be successful.  His coach, Peter Slovenski, raves about his commitment to the team and his ability to lead.</p>
<p align="left">"Taylor is one of the most intelligent team leaders I've observed in college sports," Slovenski said, "He understands how important intangible characteristics such as team spirit and team attitude are to having the best educational experience in a sports program.  He looks ahead to imagine the kind of team he wants to be part of, and then he has a gift for saying and doing the things that need to be done to get us there."</p>
<p align="left">Washburn is certainly enjoying the ride during his senior year, and is thrilled about the team's prospects for the season.</p>
<p align="left">"I love the Bowdoin cross country team," he says, "We've got a really intense and dedicated group of guys. I think we can be among the top teams in New England this year, and I'm pretty sure we're going to surprise a lot of people at the end of the season. We have a number of All-New England caliber runners. In terms of expectations or predictions, all I'll say is that we're going to be at our best in November."</p>
