            <p align="left">	Since losing back-to-back games to Middlebury and Amherst in late September, the Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team has gone on an impressive 5-0 winning streak.  Realizing the intense competition among the NESCAC schools this year, the Bears know that they would have to raise their level of play in order to win.   Now, with two games left in the season, Bowdoin is tied with Williams and Bates for first place in the league and ranked fifth in New England.</p>
<p align="left">	On the Saturday afternoon of Parent's Weekend, the Lady Polar Bears crushed the Connecticut College Camels under a warm sun on the fields behind Farley.  The Bears dominated the match from start to finish.  They out-hustled their opponents and won nearly every 50/50 ball.  </p>
<p align="left">	It took a while for Bowdoin to find the back of the net, but the Bears' patience paid off when first-year Ivy Blackmore scored an incredible goal 30 minutes into the contest.  Blackmore, with her trademark speed, faked out a Camel defender and fired a shot to the upper right corner of the net.  The keeper did not have a chance.  </p>
<p align="left">	The Bears went into the half confident with their play but wanting a couple more goals to secure the victory.  Senior Jillian Falwell helped her teammates by nailing home a goal 56 minutes into the game.  Receiving a pass from Hilary Smith '04, Falwell outran a Camel defender and notched her seventh goal of the season.  Falwell continues to be unstoppable up front.  She is a consistent scorer and a constant threat to whatever team she faces.  Smith finished out the scoring in the game 10 minutes later by placing a shot right over the keeper's head, making the final score 3-0.  </p>
<p align="left">Central midfielders Michal Shapiro '04 and Cedar Goldman '05 played a huge role in the team's win.  They controlled the tempo of the game for the Polar Bears by making great decisions on the field and communicating well with their teammates.  Both players lead by example - their intensity level is hard to match on the field, which inspires their teammates' play.</p>
<p align="left">Anna Shappell '05 continued to be a force in the net making five saves and earning her fourth shutout of the season.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin continued its strong play, giving Trinity its first loss in the past four games with a 3-2 win over the fall break weekend.  After an entire week of rest, senior Jill Falwell continued to impress by knocking home a header just six minutes into the game.  Blackmore gave Bowdoin a 2-0 advantage, scoring an unassisted goal at the 53rd minute.</p>
<p align="left">With the two-goal lead, the Polar Bears became a bit complacent and allowed the Bantams to get back into the game.  Trinity senior captain Courtney Doyle got one by keeper Shapell '05 just six minutes later, cutting the lead to one goal.  This goal moved the momentum of the game in favor of Trinity, as Bantam midfielder Nicole Mauger '05 found herself in the right place at the right time and scored on a rebound with ten minutes left on the clock.</p>
<p align="left">Just as the game seemed to be slipping away from the Bears, the trusty defense saved the day.  Goldman '05 made a great run and nailed home a shot off a corner kick just 36 seconds after Mauger's goal.  Melissa Anderson's '05 shot sealed the game for Bowdoin and gave the defense some much-needed credit.</p>
<p align="left">The defense led by Kendall Cox '05, Merrie Railsback '06, Holly Maloney '07, and Anderson appeared to be the saviors of the game.  Together the four were a wall and allowed nothing to get by after Bowdoin's game-winning shot.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin is currently in a three-way tie for first place, and with only two games left, they desperately need the fans' support.  For homecoming weekend the Bears face the Colby White Mules at 11:00 a.m. on the fields behind Farley.  Come show your support for the women's soccer team, and watch the Bears put Colby in its place. </p>
