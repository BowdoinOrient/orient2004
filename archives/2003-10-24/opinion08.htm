        </font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editor:</p>
      <p>We are writing in regards to James Baumberger's October 10 article, &quot;Pro-choice 
        strategy wrong on partial-birth abortion.&quot; While we commend Baumberger 
        for addressing an extremely sensitive and controversial topic, we wish 
        to correct some of his assumptions about &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortions 
        and the pro-choice and anti-choice movements.</p>
      <p>Mr. Baumberger's article was based on the premise that the pro-choice 
        movement picked &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion as the battle to fight. 
        We remind him that the majority political party in a house of Congress 
        sets the agenda for that house. The pro-choice movement fights the battles 
        that arise in Congress, so when a bill banning &quot;partial-birth&quot; 
        abortion comes up, that is what pro-choice groups fight. We assure Mr. 
        Baumberger that were the pro-choice movement in charge of legislation 
        and debate topics of debate in Congress, things would be very different.</p>
      <p>One of the issues in &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion that Mr. Baumberger 
        didn't mention is the problematic wording in state laws. As he acknowledges, 
        &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion isn't a medical term, but many states 
        have been passed laws that don't specify what &quot;partial-birth&quot; 
        abortion is. This leaves the definition open to interpretation regarding 
        many types of procedures and is one reason pro-choice groups have so vocally 
        opposed the bans.</p>
      <p>Mr. Baumberger wrote, &quot;In recent years, more Americans identified 
        themselves as pro-life rather than pro-choice, which was not the case 
        several years ago.&quot; He should look at the recent polls which show 
        that 31 percent (Pew Foundation) to 35 percent (Gallup/USA Today) of Americans 
        believe Roe v. Wade should be overturned. According to Planned Parenthood, 
        70 percent of voters agree that abortion decisions need to be made by 
        women with their families and doctors. These statistics indicate a pro-choice 
        majority.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most baffling part of Mr. Baumberger's article is his quick 
        dismissal of the argument that &quot;banning partial-birth abortion would 
        only be the first of many provisions on the slippery slope towards restrictive 
        abortion laws.&quot; In looking back at the last three years, it is evident 
        that we are already on that slippery slope. George Bush has an anti-choice 
        vice president, attorney general, and secretary of health and human services. 
        He has repeatedly made efforts to redefine the lawful status of a fetus, 
        thereby enabling legal phrases to define abortion as murder. He has nominated 
        anti-choice judges (Estrada, Pickering, and Owen, for example) in an attempt 
        to restrict abortions through lower levels of the judiciary. On the first 
        day of his presidency, he re-enacted the Global Gag Rule, which prohibits 
        any health care provider outside the U.S and receiving American funding 
        from mentioning abortion as an option for patients. Just last Tuesday, 
        the Senate passed a ban on &quot;partial-birth&quot; abortion that will 
        soon reach Bush and undoubtedly become a law.</p>
      <p>The anti-choice movement reaches even farther. Bush believes that abstinence-only 
        sex education should be the only thing taught in public schools. He named 
        a cofounder of an anti-condom group to the Presidential Advisory Council 
        on HIV/AIDS. The government also cut information from the Center for Disease 
        Control website about abortion and condom effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Given all of this, we find it impossible not to believe that the anti-choice 
        minority wants to take away all rights related to choice.</p>
      <p>There are many reasons to support the right to choose at all stages of 
        pregnancy, but we will not do that here. We merely want to provide Mr. 
        Baumberger and the Bowdoin community with the real facts surrounding the 
        anti-choice movement and why we, as members of the pro-choice majority, 
        are not willing to &quot;concede the partial-birth abortion ban&quot; 
        as he suggests we do.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
