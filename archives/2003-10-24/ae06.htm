            <p align="left">Rising singer-songwriter Jason Spooner brought his unique folk sound to Jack Magee's stage last night. He is touring with his three-piece band, the Jason Spooner Band, after the release of his debut CD, <i>Lost Houses</i>. Spooner is a local artist who has recently launched his career from college and community radio stations to being signed at a local independent record label which focuses on blues and American roots music. </p>
<p align="left">Spooner has been interested in music since he first discovered his father's eight-track collection of soul, pop and folk. He said that he was inspired by 70s bands and "has always been a big fan of music." He picked up the guitar in high school and fell in love with it. </p>
<p align="left">Spooner took his passion for music to local coffee houses as a teen, and then to clubs during a year in Europe. While in Spain, he was drawn to Andalucian flamenco and gypsy music, which inspired him to develop a unique rhythmic playing that goes beyond conventional guitar strumming. </p>
<p align="left">Spooner said that most of his songs are "wide brush-stroke material," which is reminiscent of R.E.M. and Radiohead's conceptual, poetic lyrics that leave room for interpretation. </p>
<p align="left">"My songs let the listener bring their own experiences to it," said Spooner. "I give a framework, but they're not too definitive." </p>
<p align="left">He described <i>Lost Houses</i> as "rootsy, bluesy, and certainly folky." The record, however, has a distinct rhythmic style that comes from its unique use of percussion. </p>
<p align="left">Spooner's musical career originated as a solo act, and he wrote the album's songs from a soloist's standpoint. </p>
<p align="left">"The band just happened," he said. "Everything just came together and it made sense to make a record." </p>
<p align="left">Drummer Reed Chambers and bassist Andy Rice round out this trio, adding dimension and backbone to Spooner's songs. Each member brings their own unique sound to the mix; Spooner's folk and blues, Chambers's funk, soul, and reggae, and Rice's jazz influences combine to create the Jason Spooner Band.</p>
<p align="left">The Jason Spooner Band performed for an enthusiastic group of Bowdoin students last night at the pub. The band's energy drew in quite a crowd. Spooner eased into the show beginning with a Bob Dylan cover, then progressed into original material. The band's songs were as unique and varied as the members themselves. In one song, Spooner sings, "Try to sit back and watch it all go by," then in another, croons to his "sweet baby," and in yet another, cries, "I lost my job and I lost my friends."</p>
<p align="left">The band's sound defies convention and is nearly indescribable. To define their music as folk or blues is too limiting. Each song is different in its own right, from melodies with a distinctive jazz feel to tunes vaguely country. The Jason Spooner Band is a delightful blend of endless genres and has the ability to combine percussion, acoustical guitar, and even an occasional harmonica to create their own sound. Listeners will be pleasantly surprised by the band's harmonious lyrics, soothing ballads and dance-worthy melodies. </p>
<p align="left">Spooner recently gained distinction as "Best Local Folk Singer/Songwriter" in the Portland Phoenix's annual "Best Music Poll" as well as "Best Solo Local Music Act" in the Casco Bay Weekly's annual "Best of Portland 2003" issue. Spooner was also selected as a finalist in the New Folk Competition held at the acclaimed Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas. Kerrville boasts an impressive roster including Shawn Colvin and Judy Collins, and launched many major label artists on their careers. Spooner said that the 18-day long festival was "all about song and joining in the art of song," adding that "in context, it makes a lot of sense." He emphasized that the focus was on collaborating and hearing songs around the campfire. </p>
<p align="left">The band is still starting out and has a lot of local support. Spooner said he likes seeing familiar faces, but also enjoys playing for different audiences that have never heard him before. <i>Lost Houses</i> can be purchased online at cdbaby.com or at Bull Moose and Borders stores in the Portland area. The Jason Spooner Band is a refreshing addition to the music scene. More information about the band and their performance dates is located on Spooner's website at www.jasonspooner.com.</p>
