        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;There's no use trying,&quot; said Alice, &quot;one 
        cannot believe impossible things.&quot; &quot;I dare say you haven't had 
        much practice, said the Queen.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Why, when I was your age, I used to believe at least six impossible 
        things before breakfast.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        We grow up believing in the possibility of the impossible. As children, 
        we live in a world of suspended reality, of Santa Clause, of fair play, 
        of Wonderland. As time progresses and reality pervades on our before-breakfast 
        dreams, we nevertheless retain certain illusions: if only we receive that 
        promotion, if only Joe or Jenny returns our affections, if only we win 
        that award, if only we seize our green light&#133;then our lives will 
        work out, then we will be happy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, as most of us have encountered at some point or another, believing 
        in Wonderland is quite independent of being able to fall down the rabbit 
        hole; often we don't get what we want; often our dreams go unrequited. 
        Nonetheless, America is more than prepared for that moment when the dream 
        ends; there is an entire section at Barnes and Noble dedicated to dealing 
        with loss, radio shows and newspaper columnists populate every city giving 
        advice on moving forward, and countless psychologists are available to 
        help you redefine and reinvent yourself. In some ways, there's a part 
        of us that never really expects the unexpected. Like Sisyphus, we are 
        more than ready to resume pushing the rock back up the hill. </p>
      <p align="left">
        All this begs the question, what happens if Sisyphus actually makes it 
        up? What happens when we get accepted to the school of our choice or our 
        dream internship? What happens when we meet the person we've spent all 
        our lives waiting for and they actually like us back? For a culture that 
        prides itself on the wealth of self-help, radios shows, astrologers, and 
        counselors to help us when we fail, there is little available to coach 
        us when we succeed, when our dreams are realized. Wonderland is an uncharted 
        territory. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Getting what we want challenges us as much as coming up empty handed. 
        For when we don't succeed, when Sisyphus doesn't reach the top of the 
        hill, he dusts himself off and begins again the same task on the same 
        path that he's been working at all of his life. In contrast, making it 
        to the top belies the question, what's next? Whether it is a higher peak 
        or a new valley, the terrain is unfamiliar. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Thus, it is not surprising that so many of us fear success as much as 
        failure, and that sometimes we feel let down when we get what we wanted 
        and worked hard for. The sense of loss that can accompany the realization 
        of a long term dream stems from two main sources: the emptiness that comes 
        when the goal that defined our existence for so long no longer stands 
        before us waiting to be achieved, and the fear that we'll lose our new-found 
        love or job that was so hard to obtain-what if we trip and the rock falls 
        back down?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Yet the greatest peril of getting what we want is the possibility that 
        all of the training, the rock pushing, the sweat and blood, which enabled 
        us to achieve our dream, were for naught-the view from the top isn't as 
        great as we thought it would be from the bottom, the law school acceptance 
        letter doesn't make us as happy as we thought it would. Whether at the 
        bottom, halfway up, or at the pinnacle of a dream, keep perspective: making 
        it to the summit of this goal is not a final destination, but a brief 
        resting point before tackling the next mountain. Consequently, next time 
        you're standing at the peak and it isn't everything you thought it would 
        be, look around at where you've come from, where you are, and where you're 
        headed, and keep pushing.</p>
