        <font size="2">DAVIN MICHAELS<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">In the history of films, there have been many Hollywood 
        legends that have sent throngs of women to the theaters with their hearts 
        on their sleeves. Actors such as Paul Newman, Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, 
        James Dean, and Clark Gable brought a macho, suave presence to the screen 
        that commanded the camera to notice them. Of the selected bunch, Marlon 
        Brando stands out because of his enormous talent as an actor, a talent 
        that accompanied his natural finesse as a man. </p>
      <p align="left">
        During his lifetime, Brando has made some 64 movies. Today many of them 
        stick out as classics . One of Brando's first movies was A Streetcar Named 
        Desire, which immediately asserted the actor's talent and gracefulness, 
        his trademarks for the next fifty years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The marvelous and powerful performance of Brando, portraying the sexy, 
        brutal Stanley Kowalski in Tennesse Williams' brilliant play, was the 
        highlight of the picture. This movie was directed by the genius filmmaker 
        Elia Kazan, and remains today a very moving story of Blanche DuBois. Vivien 
        Leight plays Stanley's fragile and neurotic sister-in-law who comes to 
        visit her sister at her home New Orleans, where she attempts to regain 
        a hold on her life. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Stanley serves as the judge, a detective, peeling off the hidden layers 
        of lies that surround Blanche. As a result, he forces her to come to grips 
        with her shameful past in addition to her mental instabilities. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Marlon Brando's forceful, dominant presence behind the camera is the key 
        to his knockout performance. Kazan skillfully brings to life this world 
        of chaos and confusion with beautiful photography and lighting that accompany 
        his original skills and insights as a director. This film lost an academy 
        award to Arthur Freed's An American in Paris and Marlon Brando was not 
        recognized with an Oscar for his performance in this picture. However 
        this can only be due to the fact that many other brilliant films were 
        released the same year.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Another major highlight in Brando's career is one was On The Waterfront 
        for which he received considerable notice. This film is, in my opinion, 
        an unquestionable masterpiece. Brando only adds more to this film's brilliance. 
        On The Waterfront tells the story of Terry Malloy (Brando) who is on his 
        way to becoming a prize-winning boxer while simultaneously doing errands 
        for the crime boss Johnny Friendly. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, the Waterfront Crime Commission is cracking down on crime 
        in the area, and when Malloy gets mixed up in a murder, the mob tries 
        to do all that they can to keep his mouth shut. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This movie is where we hear Marlon Brando speak the lines that have resonated 
        throughout movie history, &quot;I could have been a contender&#133;.I 
        could have been somebody.&quot; This movie also includes a myriad of talented 
        actors such as Lee J. Cobb, Rod Steiger, and Karl Malden. </p>
      <p align="left">
        You might ask yourself, why is this movie so beautifully shot and so carefully 
        constructed visually? That is because it is again Elia Kazan who directed 
        this work of art. This time he won best director. In addition, Brando 
        won Best Actor and the film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 
        1954. In the world of film, Marlon Brando was not just a contender but 
        truly a winner. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Aside from the two already mentioned, Brando has appeared in several other 
        well-known films. He played the character Sky Masterson in Guys and Dolls. 
        He also acted in some more obscure films such as The Appaloosa and Mutiny 
        on the Bounty. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The big blockbuster movies-you know, the ones that include those legendary 
        shots of the actor-are Apocalypse Now and The Godfather. Brando won Best 
        Actor in 1972 for his portrayal of Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather, 
        a series that is considered a crown achievement in the history of filmmaking 
        and storytelling. Most recently, Brando can be spotted in the action film 
        The Score, also starring Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For all of his achievements in the world of film, Marlon Brando, is considered 
        one of the greatest actors of his time, though he's notoriously difficult 
        to work with. He undoubtedly brought a natural presence and overwhelming 
        confidence to the big screen, and his works will be studied and cherished 
        for all time. For those unfamiliar with many of the movies mentioned, 
        it is more than worth your while to check them out and see the Don for 
        yourself.</p>
