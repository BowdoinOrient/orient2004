      <p align="left">OK, so Common wants to be a sixties-styled, psychedelic 
        sex god like Rudy Ray Moore or Marvin Gaye. To achieve this status, he 
        shaves a ring around his head so it looks like he's balding, grows a thick 
        beard and starts squinting a lot, so that when you see him, you immediately 
        think of a young, confident Phillip Banks (Uncle Phil from the Fresh Prince 
        of Bel Air), back in the days when he was a swashbuckling black lawyer, 
        courting the first Vivien. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Then he makes his album cover look like a Lovin' Spoonful reprint with 
        lots of weird blue colors, fat white people and stupid little pinwheels. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        There's still the issue of the music, so he picks up his Chicago roots 
        and moves to Manhattan, where he records the entire album in a downtown 
        recording studio built by Jimi Hendrix. Latest transformation complete. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The thugged-out Southsider Common Sense changed his name to Common in 
        the mid-nineties and did a song with Lauryn Hill about abortion. That 
        sensitive formula worked for two albums and now he's back as sexy, soulful 
        Common Gaye, cryogenically restored.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Which is not a problem in itself. If anything, the past couple of years 
        have taught us that revisiting dead music eras can produce highly original, 
        wonderful music. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Outkast and the Strokes have given us landmark &quot;revisitation&quot; 
        albums that are based on smart choices. Outkast took the outrageous polka 
        dots, plaids and basslines from Parliament, but kept their manic-paced, 
        driving style of rapping. The Strokes picked up the wear-a-week outfits 
        and the shaggy hair of bands like the Ramones, but kept their prep school 
        brattiness and good looks. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The problem with Common is that he revisits an era of music with almost 
        endless charisma, and somehow emerges from the vintage closet with all 
        the wrong lyrics, the wrong sounds and definitely, the wrong clothes. 
        It would be as if someone did a retrospective of nineties television and 
        they only showed clips of Step by Step and Saved by the Bell: The College 
        Years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps the strangest part of The Electric Circus is that none of the 
        songs mark any real departure from anything on Common's last album, Like 
        Water for Chocolate. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The beats are all still from the Okay Player camp-the snooze merchants 
        that have produced the last couple of Roots albums-and carry the trademark, 
        highly rendered, dragging drums and stolen, Earth, Wind and Fire bass 
        lines. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The lyrics are embarrassingly sensitive and are mostly about being in 
        love. Which brings us to the final problem with Common Gaye: who wants 
        to hear a rapper go on about being in love?</p>
      <p></p>
      <p align="left">
        For two quarters, you can get your own thumb-sized plastic Latino Gangster. 
        They sell them outside of Shaw's on Bath Road in those red-topped machines 
        that spit out those little plastic bubbles. Only this time, instead of 
        getting a charm bracelet or a Dallas Cowboys miniature football helmet, 
        you get tiny little guys in Fubu and wifebeaters. Pretty cool. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I have five of them, but I have two Hectors, so I will trade my Hector 
        to anyone who has a Jesus, who is my favorite, but that might only be 
        because I have a problem with wanting what I don't have. Probably when 
        I get a Jesus, I'll say to him, &quot;Sorry buddy, the thrill was in the 
        chase and now I want Al.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This summer, I put one of my two Hectors in a bowl of salsa. My unsuspecting 
        friend Will dipped a chip into the bowl and out popped Hector. Will said 
        that putting a Homey in a bowl of salsa was almost racist and that he 
        was disappointed in me. So then, I took Hector and lit his feet on fire 
        with my car lighter, hoping that I could smash his melty feet onto the 
        dashboard, where they would harden and stay forever. But that didn't work 
        either.</p>
      <p>Look for more next week when columnist Jay Kang reviews another CD in 
        addition to something else. </p>
