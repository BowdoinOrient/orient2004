        COLUMNIST</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p align="left">As President Bush gave his State of the Union address to 
        Congress on Tuesday night there were two topics that really stood out 
        above the rest. These two topics were of course the intensifying situation 
        with Iraq and the slightly less than bullish economy. Many experts are 
        saying that with his State of the Union speech, President Bush has outlined 
        what he will need to accomplish in the last two years of his term. It 
        is obvious at this point what President has planned for Iraq, but what 
        does President Bush have outlined for to help boost what he calls our 
        &quot;recovering&quot; economy?</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bush economic plan has many different aspects to it but what has definitely 
        become the cornerstone of his plan is to eliminate taxes that individuals 
        pay on dividends. What this simply means is that when an individual receives 
        a dividend he would not be required to pay income taxes on that dividend 
        as he does today. One of the main reasons that President Bush is supporting 
        this idea is that dividends, right now, are taxed twice. Before shareholders 
        receive a dividend to pay taxes on, the firm itself must first pay taxes. 
        Therefore the value of a dividend that a firm can give out to its shareholders 
        is driven down by the taxes it must pay. President Bush and those that 
        support his proposal view this as double-taxation, which it is.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Critics of cutting the dividend tax say that this is plan designed to 
        benefit only the wealthiest in the United States Senate Democratic Leader 
        Tom Daschle has actually deemed the proposed cut &quot;The Leave No Millionaire 
        Behind Act.&quot; It is true that this tax plan will benefit the richest 
        people in America. The elimination of the dividend tax, however, will 
        help the economy with its biggest wound, the stock market. The weakest 
        part of the economy during this recession has been business investment. 
        Due to the woes in the stock market, firms have not had the money to spend 
        to keep workers employed and therefore to keep the economy growing. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The elimination of the dividend tax will hopefully spark the economy because 
        it will give the stock market a boost. First, the tax cut will put more 
        money in the hands of investors to invest which naturally helps the market. 
        Second, even if investors choose not to reinvest their extra money in 
        the market they will not need to take as much money out of the market. 
        This too helps the stock market because the markets are driven down when 
        money is taken out. Finally, for those companies that want to or need 
        to hold on to their money, there is a provision in Bush's plan that allows 
        shareholders to get a break on the capital-gains tax. No matter how you 
        look at it this means that the stock is up and firms have the money to 
        spend, to innovate, to hire, to invest, and to make the economy grow.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, the question still remains of why should a tax cut be put 
        in place that benefits primarily the rich. Most Americans only invest 
        in 401(k) plans now, which are tax-free anyway. Therefore most investors 
        will not benefit from this plan. This proposed break on stock taxes, in 
        my opinion, will not put money back into the hands of the people of the 
        U.S., but actually into companies. The U.S public needs money in these 
        tough economic times but companies need it more if we want to ever see 
        the end of this troubled economy. Should we not put in place a tax cut 
        just because it directly benefits the wealthy even if the tax cut is exactly 
        what the economy needs to recover? I don't think so.</p>
