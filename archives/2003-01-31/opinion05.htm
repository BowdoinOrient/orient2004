        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> So there you are, standing at a party, keg cup in hand, 
        talking about the State of the Union address with other people who also 
        just heard about it from their friends who are Gov. majors, when all of 
        a sudden you see that person. That person who beat you in beer pong last 
        weekend, smiled at you in line at Thorne and sits in the back row in econ. 
        What to do? Whether you want to date this person or just hook up with 
        them, you are inevitably going to have to at least start a conversation. 
        As with all mating rituals, there is an established way to pick a person 
        up, whether you are male or female and depending on what you want out 
        of it. This week I would like to examine THE METHODS OF HITTING ON SOMEONE.</p>
      <p align="left">
        MALE: Guys will usually hit on a girl in a pack. This group technique 
        can best be described, as it was once explained to me, using flight crew 
        terminology. It can be composed of as few as two players or up to four. 
        Example: Charlotte, the target, is sitting with Carrie, Ramona and Talbot 
        at the bar in town. Brad, Tim and Steve, who all live together, approach 
        the table with Lloyd, who nobody really likes. Actually, Lloyd does really 
        need to be a loser; he may also be a friend who is willing to take the 
        dive. Steve is the captain, flanked by Brad the co-pilot, Tim the wingman 
        and Lloyd, the kamikaze. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Brad starts in with Talbot-they both play lacrosse and discuss their upcoming 
        seasons; Carrie joins in. While Tim asks Ramona how her brother is doing 
        and Lloyd stands there looking like a tool, Steve smiles sheepishly at 
        Charlotte. &quot;So,&quot; he says pseudo-shyly, &quot;what're you drinking?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ten to fifteen minutes into the conversation, when Carrie starts flirting 
        with Brad (bonus points!!), Talbot loses interest and through a series 
        of looks gets Ramona to go with her to talk to someone else. They say 
        they are going to the bathroom and leave Charlotte there with Steve, Tim 
        and Lloyd. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tim's job, as wingman, is to make Steve look as good as possible. He laughs 
        at Steve's jokes, tells great stories about him and they reminisce about 
        their semester abroad, making them seem all the more cool. Lloyd, being 
        naturally lame, interjects occasionally and the other two guys make fun 
        of him. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Twenty to thirty minutes go by. Tim finally bows out, claiming he needs 
        more beer. Lloyd doesn't get it and stands there awkwardly, the Screech 
        to Steve's Zack, making his captain look better and better by the second. 
        Now, Steve has to get Charlotte to ditch Lloyd with him; this is key because 
        if she goes with him, he knows he's got her hooked, if not, then he is 
        left with Lloyd and they will have to go tell their friends that she sucks. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        After this point, Steve and Charlotte will either talk intimately for 
        the rest of the night until they go home together, or they will have a 
        great conversation, go their separate ways, leave it at that, and sow 
        the seeds for a possible relationship.</p>
      <p align="left">
        FEMALE: Girls tend to go with a solo mission. Sometimes they will bring 
        a friend along as moral support when approaching a large group of hockey 
        players, but this is merely a formality and the real flirting is done 
        one-on-one. Example: Jackie stares at Mike across the room as inconspicuously 
        as possible until they finally make eye contact, when she smiles and then 
        makes herself seem thoroughly engrossed in whatever conversation she is 
        having. She may do this a few times before finally going up to a group 
        of guys, dragging Meghan behind her. Meghan is there only because Jackie 
        has done this for her before.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the girls approach the group, Jackie and Meghan laugh at the first 
        joke they hear; Jackie makes eye contact with Mike. This laughing/eye 
        contact routine goes on for ten to fifteen minutes, until Jackie is able 
        to find a suitable conversation topic for her and Mike. At this point 
        she will hold extended eye contact with him and place herself either right 
        next to, or directly facing him. Meghan will stay for approximately five 
        more minutes to talk about something very insignificant with Matt and 
        Dave in case Jackie needs a way out or support on something. After this 
        her job is done and she may leave. Matt and Dave, not being prepared for 
        a full-scale pickup operation will soon go away as well.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now it is all up to Jackie. She maintains continuous eye contact with 
        Mike-this is extremely important. She must find a perfect balance between 
        teasing him and flattering him-teasing him enough to break down his ego, 
        flattering him enough to make him associate talking to her with feeling 
        cool. </p>
      <p align="left">
        First physical contact is when she touches his arm to make a point. This 
        is repeated several times. Her excuse being that the music is too loud, 
        she will lean in and talk directly into his neck/ear region.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now comes the crucial decision: whether to leave it at flirting in hopes 
        (all too rare at Bowdoin) that he will ask her on a date or more likely, 
        end up going out with her, or if she just wants a hookup, this is when 
        she goes in for the kill. If Jackie is looking for something more meaningful, 
        she will claim to have to go to the bathroom or need another drink or 
        even go talk to someone. Secretly she is crossing her fingers that he 
        will email her on Monday. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If she is looking for a one-night thing, this is when she will lean in 
        to whisper again, put her hand on his back or shoulder and make full-body 
        contact, also known as &quot;the hip thrust.&quot; They will begin to 
        speak very closely, brushing cheeks. She may maneuver him against a wall 
        or in a corner. If he does not ask if she is doing anything later, she 
        will either ask him to walk her home or ask if he wants to order late 
        night pizza. It is highly unlikely, if Jackie has gotten this far, that 
        she will be rejected. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Every relationship and/or hookup has to start somewhere-this is what makes 
        the pickup so important. A wrong move can label someone as a jerk, bitch 
        or slut. A subtly orchestrated series of pickups can lead to a wonderful 
        relationship; a high volume, sexually charged, all-out campaign is the 
        origin of every one-night stand. At a school like Bowdoin where everybody 
        knows everyone else at every party, cheesy pickup lines are obsolete-you 
        already have the in, beneath the pines it's all about the execution. </p>
