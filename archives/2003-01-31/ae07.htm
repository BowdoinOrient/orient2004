        <font size="2">KERRY ELSON<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">So your parents are visiting Bowdoin and they don't like 
        Indian food. The Foodie's automatic parental recommendation, Shere Punjab, 
        is disqualified, so where should the family go for fine cuisine? And you 
        say you don't want to gamble on Bombay Mahal, Pedro O'Hara's or the Great 
        Impasta, which were briefly described in the last segment of this series, 
        when friends are in town? What's a sure bet around these parts? </p>
      <p align="left">
        Well, well, well! You've certainly arrived at the right column. This second 
        installment of the Foodie's guide to Maine Street cuisine completes her 
        summary of sit-down establishments, while next week she'll tell you aaaaall 
        about the delis, diners and coffeeshops that dot the Brunswick landscape. 
        After that, prepare for Pleasant Street.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie will now gather her hat, scarf and gloves for a slow stroll 
        down Memory Lane. She fondly remembers the pleasant surprise of Scarlet 
        Begonias. &quot;Greeted by hardwood floors and a friendly staff,&quot; 
        she wrote in September 2001, &quot;[the Foodie] relaxed amidst the scent 
        of garlic, the quiet clamor of white porcelain, and a hushed familial 
        mirth.&quot; Christmas lights and an evergreen grace Scarlet's large bay 
        windows, framing an enticing scene of smiling diners hunched over cramped 
        tables. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Cognizant of the restaurant's popularity, Scarlet B's mercurial hostess 
        has more than once kept this Foodie in anxious limbo. Will she get a table 
        or not?, the Foodie has often been left to wonder. She has often abandoned 
        her hope for a flavorful, thin-crust pizza and headed a few blocks down 
        to the equally intimate Shere Punjab, which always seems to have a table 
        ready.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sometimes, however, the Foodie really wants Italian. When Scarlet's is 
        full, she often heads to Benzoni's. This two-level joint more comfortably 
        accomodates large parties and the bar greets customers who have to wait 
        for a table. What Benzoni's lacks in creativity and atomosphere, it makes 
        up for in speed of service and quantity of menu offerings. Meals are standard; 
        you won't find whimsical titles for pasta plates and there'll be one kind 
        of cheese on your pizza, but conservative diners will find this place 
        comfortable. </p>
      <p align="left">
        She fondly remembers the calzone of her first Benzoni's sojourn. &quot;Everything 
        looked freshly prepared and hot from the oven,&quot; she wrote. &quot;The 
        ricotta cheese in the&#133;calzone provided a simple background for spinach 
        and red peppers. The thick crust might have overpowered this interior, 
        but it made the meal hearty.&quot;&quot;Although Benzoni's pleases the 
        palate well enough, the Foodie wouldn't return on her own accord.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the Foodie has returned to Benzoni's and Scarlet B's since her initial 
        evaluation, she has chosen to enter neither Richard's, nor Bangkok Garden, 
        nor MacMillan and Co. nor Henry Marty a second time. The Foodie yearns 
        not for mediocre cuisine, but each establishment does have its own unique 
        charm. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Richard's is an Epcot Center German joint supplanted in Brunswick. Bland, 
        yet nicely presented, pairings of sausages and kraut abound. She wrote 
        in early November, &quot;Exposed brick, dark wood paneling, dim lights 
        and 'traditional' German music create a cozy, if not parodic, atmosphere. 
        While the food is priced a bit high for Brunswick, service is fast and 
        friendly&#133;.&quot; If the restaurant was as empty as it was when the 
        Foodie visited, it should be a sure bet if other places are busy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Exoticism oozes out of Bangkok Garden. While the Foodie would recommend 
        Thai House on Pleasant Street over this Fort Andross nook, a car-less 
        party will find Garden's well-priced, amply-spiced food satisfactory. 
        Flashback to November 2002! &quot;Most dishes at Bangkok Garden are a 
        variation on a simple formula&quot; the Foodie wrote, &quot;meat and vegetables 
        + sauce + rice or noodles. This Foodie's Pineapple Chicken did not arrive 
        in a pineapple shell as promised; nevertheless, its sweet and spicy flavors 
        were well balanced and the vegetables were fresh.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        While Henry Marty is more upscale than MacMillan &amp; Co., each offers 
        classic American food with a twist. Marty twists and shouts towards Italian 
        influences, with such appetizer offerings as grilled artichoke hearts, 
        while MacMillan &amp;Co. prides itself on fresh Mainer seafood and steak 
        platters. Henry Marty is more likely to impress parents with its slightly 
        out-of-place haughtiness, but MacMillan &amp; Co. may be more familiar 
        and comforting. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If threatened with a lobster tail to choose between the two establishments, 
        the Foodie would select Henry Marty for its more sophisticated flavor 
        juxtapositions. </p>

        restaurant commentary by visiting orient.bowdoin.edu. Stay tuned for Part 
        Three!</p>
