        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">On a typically frigid Saturday, the men of the Bowdoin Track 
        &amp; Field Team jumped, raced and threw their way to a second straight 
        win over local rivals Colby and Southern Maine at the Farley Field House. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the Polar Bears have yet to reach full stride, the team exhibited 
        a feisty resolve and a sense of urgency worthy of the New England championships. 
        Both of the visiting schools brought strong squads, and Bowdoin's twenty-point 
        victory over the White Mules was especially auspicious. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Particularly encouraging was the emergence of a serious and powerful Bowdoin 
        weight team. Junior Chris Wagner led the Polar Bears in the shot put, 
        taking first place with a throw of 44'7&quot;. He was followed by teammates 
        Pat Lyons '06, Ted Lyons '06, Jarret Young '05, and Jamie Salsich '03, 
        who took four out of the next five spots. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though Colby's Lee Rankin managed to pick up first in the weight throw, 
        Bowdoin's Joe Wilson '04 hurled his way to second place, and Young and 
        Wagner doubled back to take third and sixth, respectively. With nearly 
        every athlete recording a personal best, the success of the weight squad 
        helped to set the tone for the rest of the afternoon.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The sprints were similarly strong. Junior captain Brian Laurits and sophomore 
        sensation Greydon Foil flew to a one-two finish in the 400-meter run. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Seniors Chris Davidson (second in the 200-meter run) and Matt Volk (third 
        in the 55-meter dash) continued their triumphant returns from injury with 
        solid performances in the shorter events. Bowdoin also ran away with a 
        victory in the 4 x 400-meter relay (3:27), defeating Colby by six seconds, 
        and Southern Maine by eighteen. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The 600-meter race, which featured an intense all-black battle at the 
        front, was the highlight of the middle distance events. Junior Phil Webster, 
        who specializes in shorter distances, moved up to take on senior Byron 
        Boots and junior Steve Franklin, both of whom usually run the half mile. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the lead was exchanged several times in the final lap, Webster's 
        blazing speed won the day, as he ran away with the victory in a very good 
        time of 1:24. Franklin and Boots followed close behind, and Jordan Harrison 
        '04 kicked into high gear to give the Bears a sweep of the top four spots. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Senior distance runners Dan Gulotta and Jeff Rubens led the squad in the 
        1,000 and 1,500-meter races, finishing second and third, respectively. 
        Rubens doubled back to join Franklin, junior Scott Herrick, and senior 
        Evan Matzen for an easy victory in the Distance Medley Relay. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The 3,000-meter run was Saturday's lone distance event, and senior captain 
        Pat Vardaro (8:47) excited the Bowdoin faithful with another commanding 
        win against a competitive field. Conor O'Brien '03 placed second in 9:09. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though Colby is known for its prowess in the horizontal jumps, several 
        Bowdoin athletes had very good performances and placed well. Junior Tung 
        Trinh jumped a personal best of 20'11&quot; in the long jump, which was 
        good enough for second place overall. Senior Aaron Donohoe triple-jumped 
        38'3&quot; to finish third. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Polar Bears also took the top two spots in both of the vertical jumps. 
        Jon Todd '05 and Brian Grandjean '04 placed one-two in pole vault, while 
        James Wilkins '04 and Tim Pasekarnis '03 earned top honors in the high 
        jump. Todd cleared a height of 13'4&quot;, and Wilkins demonstrated his 
        consistent excellence with a solid leap of 6'7&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tomorrow, in what promises to be one of the most competitive early New 
        England meets of the season, the Polar Bears will take on the Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology, Tufts University, and Springfield College at 
        Farley Field House. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Technicians, the Jumbos, and the Pride are all among the region's 
        top track teams, and the highest level of competition is expected in every 
        event. Spectators are welcome. </p>
