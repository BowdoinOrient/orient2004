        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">It's not easy to write about a Holocaust film and it's certainly 
        no easier to make one-such an undertaking requires a tight-gripped, unyielding 
        dedication from all involved if it is to be done well, or done at all. 
        The director, the crew, and most of all, the actors, must delve into this 
        hell of history headfirst. None can possibly come out of it unscathed 
        or unchanged. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And such is the case with The Pianist, the latest masterpiece to come 
        from the mind of Roman Polanski, the controversial European director who 
        last left his mark on American cinema with Chinatown in 1974. Since then 
        Polanski has made mostly foreign-flavored films.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Set in the director's native Poland, the film is set during the worse 
        year of World War II. It tells the true story of an artistic prodigy, 
        a Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. As the comforts of his life 
        erode away under Nazi control, Szpilman quickly loses control of his world. 
        Aided by his wits, his friends, and his spirited passion for music, Szpilman 
        struggles to stay alive. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Adrien Brody, a relative newcomer to Hollywood gossip circles, goes through 
        various transformations in this film, transformations that are similar 
        to those that Tom Hanks undergoes in Cast Away (though far superior in 
        my opinion). His character is both vivid and terrifying as he adopts Szpilman's 
        despair. Brody can show the intensity of the war's effect on his character 
        through the nervous tick of an eye or a frenzied twitch of his arm.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps our unfamiliarity with Brody as an actor in some way contributes 
        to the authenticity of his performance. Szpilman pretends nothing; he 
        is no hero, but merely human. Brody himself is no movie star, but just 
        an actor. Perhaps that will all change by the Oscars, but his extraordinary 
        talent doesn't need an award to be legitimate.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Being mostly a character-centered drama--as opposed to war-centered drama-one 
        wouldn't expect much attention to be paid to the visuals. But it is, and 
        it throws the viewer into a kind of shock. Polanski resuscitates not only 
        the pianist, but also the city, the war, and the times from the dusty 
        tombs of historic memory. He shows that the streets, the crumbling ghettoes, 
        and the war itself are every bit a part of Szpilman as is his own will. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Along with Szpilman's hope, we see the city of Warsaw crumble little by 
        little in wide, encompassing shots of desolation. In one notable scene, 
        perhaps the most beautiful in the entire film, charred and smoking shells 
        of buildings, sickened by dirty clouds of dust, stretch on for miles, 
        and Szpilman, limping over the rubble, is the only thing still living-the 
        only one still standing. But such is his story and such is history; it 
        is a tragic triumph, a quiet victory overshadowed by massive, unbearable 
        destruction. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But like most World War II films, particularly those dealing with the 
        Holocaust, the most powerful element is the emotion and the raw unbridled 
        inhumanity of the time. In one scene, in a moment of maddening desperation, 
        Szpilman's father slowly cuts a caramel, no bigger than a small tootsie 
        roll, into eight equal pieces and gives one of each to his family while 
        they wait in a fenced pen to be taken away to the camps in boxcars. In 
        countless other scenes, soldiers shoot down Jews without hesitation and 
        without regard for their humanity. It just happens. The sound of the bullet 
        lingers with you long after the bodies are forgotten.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Far from Hollywood's sensationalized drama, The Pianist is, in certain 
        ways, more realistic than Spielberg's legendary Schindler's List. Consequently, 
        however, it is not as blatantly touching. The Pianist is a difficult film 
        to take but its masterful honesty and brilliant performances make it a 
        must-see for anyone who's ready and willing.</p>
