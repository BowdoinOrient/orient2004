        <font size="2">BOBBY DESAULNIERS<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">At the conclusion of Super Bowl XXXVII, everyone had an 
        opinion of who should receive the coveted &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; 
        award. Households and sports bars across the nation were undecided-even 
        John Madden picked the whole Buccaneers defense to win the award. </p>
      <p align="left">
        True fans glued their eyes to the television and attempted to bear the 
        Bon Jovi performance to see the award presentation. As 1,000 year-old 
        Bon Jovi finished his second blessing of melodic styling, fans across 
        the nation turned the volume on their televisions back on to see Dexter 
        Jackson step on stage and take home the MVP trophy. Well, Penn and Teller 
        knew it all along, right...</p>
      <p align="left">
        It is true that Dexter Jackson did pick off two Rich Gannon passes early 
        in the game to set the tone. However, do you think that league MVP Rich 
        Gannon would decide that he would go out and break Drew Bledsoe's record, 
        of four interceptions in a Super Bowl, just to keep the game close? </p>
      <p align="left">
        No, he was pressured. Simeon Rice had two sacks on Gannon, and the early 
        pressure made Gannon throw passes that resembled those of Gus Frerotte. 
        Jackson's performance was a direct result of pressure from the Bucs' defensive 
        line. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Can one give Dexter Jackson, a second-rate safety, all of the credit? 
        Of course not, he had only three picks all season. What about Simeon Rice? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        He finished the game with five tackles and two sacks. One sack stopped 
        the Raiders on a two-point conversion. One can argue that coverage sacks 
        do exist and the reason that Rice had two sacks is because the defensive 
        backfield played so well. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Such an argument would be valid if Rice's sacks occurred when Gannon was 
        scrambling, but they didn't. Let's be honest-Rice was on Gannon quicker 
        than flies on...well... Gannon on Sunday. They were certainly not coverage 
        sacks. Perhaps Simeon Rice deserves the award. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Maybe the whole defense should win the honor. As Rice, Greg Spires, and 
        Warren Sapp did put great pressure on Gannon all night, the defensive 
        backfield did come up with five interceptions. This is no easy task for 
        any team, especially when defending against Jerry Rice, Tim Brown, Jerry 
        Porter, and, oh yeah, Rich Gannon. As the coverage sack argument carries 
        some merit, let's give it to the defense as a whole. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Who else contributed greatly to the Bucs' win on Sunday? Of course, how 
        can one forget the Raiders coaching staff? In playing against the number-one 
        defense in the league that, in successive weeks, shut down QBs Jeff Garcia 
        and Donovan McNabb, one would think that the Raider coaching staff would 
        look to balance off their gross passing emphasis with their running attack 
        this week. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Take into consideration that they may have the biggest and, arguably, 
        the best offensive line in the NFL along with possibly the most explosive 
        runner in the league, Charlie Garner. Zach Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley 
        balance off Garner's style by adding a powerful, brutish aspect to the 
        Raider's running game. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the Raider's coaching staff gave Garner the ball only seven times 
        on Sunday. Crockett and Wheatley combined to run the ball only four times 
        as well. Even Garner's baby blue suit couldn't get him noticed by his 
        own coaches. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Defenses that are based on speed and pass rushing ability inherently have 
        a weakness in stopping the run, especially when monsters like Frank Middleton 
        and Lincoln Kennedy are blocking. As well as the Bucs defense played, 
        the Raider coaching staff gave Tampa Bay their biggest advantage in making 
        their own running game obsolete. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps Bill Callahan and his genius play-callers deserve the award. Of 
        all of those who contributed to the win for the Bucs, I still think the 
        MVP award goes to one man only-Bill Parcells. Although not directly related 
        to the game on Sunday, Parcells played a pivotal role in getting John 
        Gruden where he is today. If Parcells had reneged in the interest in the 
        Bucs last season, Tony Dungee (former Bucs head coach) would still be 
        enjoying Tampa Bay sunshine and John Gruden would still be in Oakland. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Instead, the Bucs fired Dungee to get Parcells, but as Parcells backed 
        out, the Bucs scrambled for Gruden. As great of a coach as Dungee is, 
        he is no Andy Reid, no Bill Parcells, and certainly no John Gruden. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Gruden brought Gannon and Brad Johnson to where they are today. He turned 
        two mediocre quarterbacks, at best in Johnson's case, into NFL stars. 
        His intensity is unmatched and the fact that his two teams played in the 
        Super Bowl demands respect for his overall coaching ability, on and off 
        the field. Parcells put Gruden in Tampa Bay. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Gruden's changing of Bays, from Oakland to Tampa Bay, was the difference 
        in this game. One man is responsible for this change and that man deserves 
        the MVP of Super Bowl XXXVII. That man is Bill Parcells.</p>
