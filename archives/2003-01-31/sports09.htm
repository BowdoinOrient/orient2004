      <p align="left">King James is already acting like a king-slamming down show-time 
        dunks on national television, draining threes, befuddling opponents, and 
        driving around town in a H2 Hummer. Can you believe the nerve of this 
        18-year old high school senior?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Just because he is the most talented amateur basketball player in the 
        world, LeBron James thinks that he is a cut above the ordinary high school 
        student. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Just because he has a reported 47-inch vertical leap and the peripheral 
        passing vision of Magic Johnson, he thinks that he has the right to own 
        a Hummer and cry &quot;You sorry!&quot; after every rim-rattling dunk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        To top it all off, James thinks that it is wise to bypass college and 
        head straight to the NBA where millions of dollars and countless endorsement 
        opportunities await. And you know what? He's right.</p>
      <p align="left">
        LeBron James has earned the privilege to act like a king in America. His 
        enormous skill combined with his 6'8,&quot; 240-pound frame sets him apart 
        from every other high school senior in the United States of America. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While most seniors ponder their college choices or line of work, James 
        gets to sit back and wonder which team will win the NBA Lottery in May. 
        Although he just officially became an adult, James has already secured 
        his status as the first pick in the 2003 NBA draft.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Imagine Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, and Larry Bird rolled into one 
        player. According to reputable scouts, James has that kind of potential 
        in the NBA. Why, then, do we expect him to act like a regular high school 
        kid?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Why do we chastise his mother for buying him a $50,000 automobile for 
        his 18th birthday? What's wrong with celebrating a little early? If you 
        were brought up in the projects and had millions of dollars piling up 
        as a graduation gift, wouldn't you be tempted to dip into the cash pool? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Instead of focusing on the misnomer of the &quot;amateur&quot; athlete 
        in the modern era, critics zero in on LeBron James and claim that he represents 
        everything that's wrong with today's athletes. The purchase of the Hummer 
        illustrates his greed, his recent fender bender shows that he is irresponsible, 
        and finally that his game is all flash and no substance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, these shortsighted critics fail to realize that the James family 
        is not exploiting the system; rather, the system is exploiting the talents 
        and amateur status of LeBron James. As a senior at St. Vincent-St. Mary 
        High School, King James' fame is sufficient for others to make money off 
        his name.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, if James acts upon any ambition to earn money off his own name, 
        he will forfeit his status as an amateur athlete. Worse than that, he 
        will watch his reputation become publicly tainted before ever putting 
        on a NBA jersey.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the meantime, Sports Illustrated and ESPN have the right to sell magazines 
        with LeBron gracing the cover. In addition, television affiliate ESPN 
        2 aired the first-ever and second-ever nationally televised high school 
        basketball games. Guess who was playing.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Earlier in the season, James skied for his usual rim-shaking dunk in practice. 
        His force tore the rim off the backboard, and he landed awkwardly on his 
        tailbone. No worries, however. The high school's athletic director was 
        quick to run out on the court to make sure James was all right-and to 
        take the rim as his own personal keepsake. Guess how much that will be 
        worth if James becomes an all-star.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Do you want more proof of the exploitation of the amateur? Log onto ebay.com 
        and search for &quot;LeBron James&quot; products. Currently, 498 items 
        are on sale, including the &quot;Lebron James Lightswitch&quot; for the 
        &quot;true fan,&quot; the LeBron James' Sports Illustrated with no label, 
        the LeBron James autographed basketball, and even the &quot;Rare LeBron 
        James Face Sign.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        People all across America get to buy and sell a piece of the senior from 
        Ohio, but James himself cannot enter the market. He must watch as hundreds 
        of transactions are made in his name. And that's what is deemed just and 
        fair by every high school athletic association in the United States?</p>
      <p align="left">
        The system is flawed. As an &quot;amateur&quot; athlete, everyone can 
        make money off of you, but you cannot make money off yourself. Herein 
        lies the inherent contradiction in the amateur status. LeBron James is 
        only an amateur to himself and to his family. To everyone else, he is 
        a marketable commodity.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In light of this exploitation, can you really insist that James should 
        take his game to the NCAA where he would retain his nonprofessional status? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        As of 1999, the average Division-I basketball head coach earned $164,297 
        per year. Furthermore, basketball brings millions of dollars to colleges 
        through television revenues and deals with sponsors like Nike. Meanwhile, 
        the average player receives a free college education and a free pass to 
        be exploited.</p>
      <p align="left">
        LeBron James is too good of a ballplayer and too smart of a person to 
        subject himself to four years-or even one year-of college basketball. 
        He's heading straight to the pros. Heck, he's already a professional to 
        everyone else. </p>
