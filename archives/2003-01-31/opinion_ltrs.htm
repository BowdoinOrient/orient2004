      <p align="left"><font size="5">An alternative to Bowdoin layoffs</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> Last week's <i>Orient</i> brought some striking news. On the front page 
        was the announcement of numerous layoffs to occur among Bowdoin College 
        staff. The reasons given for these layoffs were the &quot;unpredictable 
        state of the national economy,&quot; and lower returns on the college 
        endowment.</p>
      <p align="left">
        To my thinking, this is a great fallacy with modern college budgeting. 
        Modern college budgeting is based on using the interest earned by the 
        college's endowment to fund an academic school year. While a good idea 
        in times of economic strength, we are now witnessing the weakness of this 
        method. In a strong economy, the endowment will return the necessary money, 
        and perhaps even yield a surplus. However, the weakened economy has returned 
        about 1.3 to 1.5 million dollars less than expected. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I wish to propose a radical idea. Middlebury College, a sister NESCAC 
        school that is experiencing the same fiscal woes, has decided to forgo 
        only using the interest on their endowment, and has decided to cut into 
        it for the remainder of this fiscal year. This sounds like a dangerous 
        plan, but when one considers that the shortfall is merely $1.5 million 
        of an endowment in excess of $400 million, the danger loses its bite. 
        The loss of that money and associated interest will be minimal by comparison 
        to what would be saved. Even operating for three years using that little 
        amount of money would only barely touch one percent of the money in the 
        endowment. Operating for ten years, arguably the length of most economic 
        downturns would only barely touch three to five percent of the school's 
        endowment.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This would go a long way to ensuring the fiscal responsibility of the 
        school. Bowdoin is the second largest employer in the town of Brunswick, 
        and third in the Brunswick/Bath area. Bowdoin employees come from places 
        as far away as Camden to teach or work at this school. Thus, Bowdoin College 
        is responsible for a large portion of the economic strength of the mid-coast 
        community. Eliminating any jobs would harm this economy and hurt the area 
        of Maine we have all come to know and love. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This image of responsibility would be further enhanced by cutting expenses 
        other than jobs. The amount of waste generated by certain departments 
        in the College is unbelievable: weekly letters placed in student mailboxes 
        that immediately end up in the garbage, students and the whole community 
        allowed free printing rights in the libraries, and other wasteful ventures 
        could all be trimmed without the loss of jobs. Continuing to build a new 
        building for departments who have more than adequate facilities is simply 
        foolish, many of which have been upgraded within the past ten years. Holding 
        off until the recession ends would save millions of dollars. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If there is no work to be done, I can understand the elimination of a 
        &quot;position.&quot; But to eliminate &quot;positions&quot; while maintaining 
        this wasteful spending is a fallacy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Thus, I urge the administration to reconsider their decision to eliminate 
        25 to 30 positions at Bowdoin. There are other and more effective ways 
        to match the budget shortfalls.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Tuesday, January 21: the five of us packed into a Ford Smocus to begin 
        our ten-hour road trip for Roe. As five young feminists, we wanted to 
        commemorate the 30th anniversary of Roe v. Wade in the heart of the action, 
        Washington D.C. We arrived in D.C at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, took 
        a brief nap, and set off for a full day of conventions organized by the 
        Feminist Majority Foundation. The conference brought over 400 college 
        students, male and female, from 40 different states, all united to improve 
        and ensure reproductive safety, health, and choice for women. The idea 
        of sleep quickly left our minds as inspiring women such as Eleanor Smeal 
        (President of Feminist Majority Foundation), Gloria Feldt (President of 
        Planned Parenthood), Kate Michelman (President of NARAL: Pro-Choice America), 
        Dr. Jane Smith (CEO Business and Professional Women/USA), Congresswoman 
        Sheila Jackson, and Senator Barbara Boxer gave riveting speeches informing 
        us about the status of women's reproductive rights and how the current 
        administration is working to deny those rights. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The conference served to educate us as campus organizers of Bowdoin's 
        Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance (FMLA) about the imminent danger 
        the Bush administration poses to our reproductive health rights, access 
        to sex education in public schools, and global family planning. With the 
        probability that Bush will appoint at least one and most likely two new 
        Supreme Court Justices during his term, the women speaking at the conference 
        could not stress enough the very real threat his administration poses. 
        Right now, the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision insuring access to abortion for 
        all women stands at a razor-thin 5-4 majority in the Supreme Court. With 
        the appointment of an anti-choice justice, that decision could be reversed. 
        Ellie Smeal warned us of how states have slowly chipped away at women's 
        rights surrounding our choice to terminate a pregnancy. Individual states 
        have imposed restrictions such as 24 hour waiting periods, dual-parent 
        consent, and the shutting down of clinics. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To lose Roe, actually a very moderate compromise, would be devastating. 
        Roe v. Wade is less about the actual abortion topic than the constitutional 
        right to privacy and choice. If Roe were overturned, most of us on Bowdoin's 
        campus could cope. We would find the funds to get it done safely and travel 
        wherever it took. As of now, with abortion being legal, women not as fortunate 
        as some of us are denied this basic right because their healthcare will 
        not cover it, hospitals will not provide this service, or they have to 
        travel hours or even days to get to a clinic. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Our attendance at the candlelight vigil in front of the Supreme Court 
        on Wednesday evening proved the animosity present between the two opposing 
        sides. The anti-choice activists invaded our rally, shoving their posters 
        in our face, and calling us &quot;murderers.&quot; On Thursday, we lobbied 
        Maine's senators and demanded the continuation of a woman's right to privacy. 
        They, along with all the women at the conference, urged us to take action. 
        As sexually active young women and men, Roe affects us the most. We have 
        to keep our access to abortion safe and legal. To make a difference FMLA 
        holds meetings at 9:00 p.m. on Monday in the Women's Resource Center.

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>President Bush is not an &quot;evil&quot; man</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In her article in last week's Orient, Katherine Crane makes the outlandish 
        statement that the &quot;life of a fetus . . . is the only life Bush cares 
        about.&quot; This statement is not only polarizing, but it is offensive 
        and untrue. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As &quot;evidence&quot; that Bush does not care about human life, Crane 
        cites his war in Iraq, ignoring that this war is more likely to, in the 
        long, save Iraqi lives. After all, an American supported regime in Iraq 
        is unlikely to kill 6,000 Kurds with mustard gas, unlike a certain dictator 
        currently in power. Beyond that, Ms. Crane claims that Bush doesn't care 
        about the education of the poor kids who are most likely to be aborted, 
        but, once again, that is untrue. Bush supports voucher schools, and kids 
        who are in this program, particularly in Milwaukee, did considerably better 
        on standardized tests. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Whether or not you support voucher schools, you must admit that they are 
        at least a plan to deal with the educational problem in America. To accuse 
        Bush of not caring about human life is to accuse him of being evil. We 
        may disagree with our president's policies, but he is not an evil man.</p>

      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">God forbid if the chapel towers fell over. That would certainly 
        make communication with the almighty a bit tougher come Sunday. Fear not, 
        the College is on a 12-step program to fixing this problem. They just 
        haven't been able to admit their fault-Step 1. Let them fall over-cheap, 
        funny, colorful, a real draw. It's a Greek, Parthenon thing we could get 
        going. </p>
      <p align="left"> Let's focus on the &quot;cheap.&quot; The College's endowment 
        is over $400 million, but still the overseers of this little pot had the 
        audacity to announce the layoffs of 25 people this past week. It is a 
        tragedy that such a &quot;liberal&quot; institution would place a great 
        value on fixing some archaic, unused sanctuary, while ignoring its own. 
        But, don't think that those two shrouded towers are the only excesses 
        putting people out of work. Why, as you read this, you're probably standing 
        next to something that Bowdoin doesn't need.</p>
      <p align="left"> The costliest problem at Bowdoin and the easiest to remedy 
        is athletics. That means the Department of Athletics, not your treadmill. 
        To think that Bowdoin funds teams to take their away games to the Bahamas 
        and California while the college is suffering economically is sickening. 
        Hey, Barry, you're looking to cut the fat? Pssst, over here. </p>
      <p align="left"> I am the foremost supporter of college athletics, but not 
        when the fun of some kids is at the expense of working adults. It is un-American 
        to put games ahead of work and a person's paycheck. The administration 
        should take a closer look at athletics and the few dollars that it draws 
        in each year before it makes any permanent decisions. </p>
      <p align="left"> The most commonly sighted problem at Bowdoin concerns frivolous 
        expenditures, and one in particular is the following: the &quot;things&quot; 
        hanging in Thorne Dining Hall. Rumor is, and by their sheer grotesqueness 
        I assume this to be true, that these &quot;lights&quot; cost a cool ten 
        grand apiece. A friend of mine asked me to mention the new recycling bins 
        in the Union. I haven't actually seen them, but I did see the old ones 
        and determined their ability to hold paper &quot;excellent.&quot; And 
        stop installing new sod, the grass is sending you a message. </p>
      <p align="left"> Apparently the College is expanding. And the best way to 
        expand? Add on to Sills. Well, nobody likes Sills, and nobody will like 
        anything near Sills. There are over 120 buildings on this campus, and 
        one more is just a joke. </p>
      <p align="left"> Finally, I ask a logistical question. If you have $400 
        million, what is $1 million here or there? That .25 percent (yes, point) 
        is what Bowdoin is trying to save this year. It is shameful that Bowdoin 
        could be so greedy, especially with the job market that those departing 
        from us will face. Now I know that it wouldn't be totally prudent to save 
        these jobs, but it would be fair and right. </p>
      <p align="left"> Bowdoin's problems can't be solved by laying off 25 people. 
        Its problems can be solved when the administration finally takes a personal 
        look at what is important and what is fair. When they take a step outside 
        of their little bubbles, and put themselves in the 2003 job market. If 
        the only way to expand is to lay off workers, then simply don't expand. 
        Don't advantage yourselves by disadvantaging others. That's not what Bowdoin 
        teaches. </p>
      <p align="left"> I don't think I will ever have $400 million. However, I 
        can be sure that I wouldn't want $400 million if it makes my decisions 
        this cruel. </p>
