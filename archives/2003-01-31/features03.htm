        Born in Bethel, Stanley Willis Allen '39 knew what is was like to wake 
        in the dark Maine night and feel the cool breeze slide swiftly over soft 
        human skin. The pine trees as the lakes and the coves were his home in 
        this state that had become a part of him. Even while in College at Bowdoin, 
        Allen did not leave his state. When not in school he worked as the manager 
        of Bethel Restaurant, and saved up for a future he must have dreamed of. 
        But Stanley Allen was a young man in troubled times and he knew his duty. 
        Whether this last was inspired by the revered President Sills or the friendly 
        and kind Dean Nixon, or whether Allen had himself been conscientious of 
        what he needed to do to ensure his future and the future of the United 
        States, he volunteered in the Navy after graduating in the Class of 1939. 
        Allen went through the training, probably thought of home and the cool, 
        clean Maine air on occasion and rose to the rank of ensign. His command 
        was the battleship U.S.S. Oklahoma, based at Pearl Harbor.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Like the armada that swarmed the British homeland, this smaller wave of 
        fighters, bombers and torpedo planes came across water to reach their 
        target. Thinner than the ranks of the Luftwaffe, these pilots were more 
        determined and had traveled much further to accomplish their mission. 
        Having left their aircraft carriers at sea, the planes-marked by a red 
        circle on their tails to designate the might of the rising sun-narrowed 
        in on their targets. Their flight path took them past some of the most 
        beautiful scenery on earth-untapped forests of tropical splendor, across 
        rocky beaches where the bounty of the mighty Pacific was thrown. For the 
        pilots, it must have felt like the flight took forever. Soon, however, 
        they saw dwellings, civilians, unsuspecting or disbelieving citizens who 
        looked upon these chariots in the sky with awe and sudden pangs of dread. 
        The planes moved on and from afar they could make out the United States 
        Pacific Fleet, in dock, moored to the shallow defenses of Pearl Harbor. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        It was Sunday, December 7, 1941-the day of infamy. Shortly before 8 A. 
        M. the first bombs were dropped. From afar and to the untrained eye of 
        a civilian, it may have seemed as if it took forever for the projectile 
        to descend. Perhaps this illusion was due to the magnitude of the event-was 
        this really happening? Who would dare disrupt the glorious might of the 
        greatest nation on earth? But slowly, helped by the physics of gravity 
        the bomb would descend, pre-aimed by the pilot, and find its target. The 
        explosions came from all around and bombs and torpedoes smashed into steal, 
        ripped apart living quarters, armaments, human beings. Many of the Fleet's 
        officers were ashore for the weekend and the ships were under the command 
        of young men who had never heard a gun fired in anger-men out of college 
        like Stanley Allen. Air bases on the islands of Hawaii were simultaneously 
        struck by the Japanese attackers. The reign of terror from the sky wrecked 
        dozens of planes that were still resting peacefully in the glittering 
        sunlight. For those who were there, it must has seemed like the world 
        was falling apart. Oklahoma took two hits and was already in bad shape 
        when a third struck just below the center of the vessel. The senior commander 
        onboard assessed the situation and realized that there was nothing he 
        could do. &quot;Abandon ship!&quot; he ordered in an attempt to get the 
        men to safety before it was too late. Shards of metal, pieces of dirt, 
        debris and clothes flew everywhere as the darkened halls tilted under 
        the ship's punctured hull. As the men were in the process of evacuating 
        a fourth torpedo struck and blew the battleship slightly upwards. When 
        Oklahoma landed, she turned on her side and capsized. The men who had 
        been holding onto the railings slid forward and fell towards the water, 
        their ship coming down upon them. The Arizona, most famous of the wrecked 
        battleships was struck by a bomb in its forward magazine. The eruption 
        could be heard even over the sound of the raging battle. It was on that 
        ship that another Bowdoin graduate, Lt. Commander John E. French of the 
        Class of 1921 was serving. As the ship exploded from within it took with 
        it 1,500 of its crew. Four hundred members of the Oklahoma perished with 
        her. The final count found 3,600 casualties along with six battleships 
        destroyed, more than half a dozen other vessels damaged, and almost two 
        hundred planes burning in the Sunday afternoon. Clouds of thick black 
        smoke billowed from the wreckage as oil and blood filled with harbor and 
        the sirens and alarms began to be heard over the cries of the wounded 
        and the dying. As the smoke rose above the battlefield it clung against 
        waving U.S. flags and then continued to rise, following the wind that 
        blew it, along with news of the attack, towards the continental United 
        States. To the nation Franklin Roosevelt would declare that America had 
        entered the war and to Bowdoin College, the news would later confirm that 
        Stanley Willis Allen of the Oklahoma and John E. French of the Arizona 
        had been among those killed in action at Pearl Harbor.</p>
      <p align="left">
        ***</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The door to my office and the door to my house are open to you twenty-four 
        hours a day,&quot; wrote President Kenneth C. M. Sills following the Japanese 
        attack on Pearl Harbor. The message was posted for all on Bowdoin's campus 
        to see but the note was a reminder to all Bowdoin men who came upon it 
        that the President's house was open for them in this time of national 
        tragedy. Kenneth Sills had seen a world war before this generation of 
        college students had even been born and now he knew that he would have 
        to stand firm and be the tower of strength that they always saw him to 
        be.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The attack on Pearl Harbor had taken its toll. U.S. citizens, who had, 
        at first, been opposed to intervention were suddenly calling for revenge 
        and the mighty industrial strength of the nation was awakened with a fury. 
        Two Bowdoin men had been among those killed in the attacks and as word 
        reached the campus, faculty members must have mourned and wondered how 
        many of the students who were with them would soon be listed in the columns 
        of &quot;killed in action.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like a majority of American men, the sentiment on the Bowdoin campus was 
        to get into the armed forces and do their patriotic duty. The administration's 
        immediate reaction was to attempt to curb this sudden militaristic enthusiasm. 
        President Sills, speaking in the Chapel on December 9, 1941, urged students 
        to stay in college and continue their studies until they were summoned. 
        The President declared:</p>
      <p align="left">
        It is perfectly clear that the duty for most of you is to remain where 
        you are until the country clearly needs you. While here, regard the time 
        and training as very precious. If there is anything really valuable in 
        education in normal days, it certainly must also be valuable in emergencies.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the nation prepared for a gloomy holiday season that December, Bowdoin 
        students spoke with each other and with faculty members, trying to come 
        to grips with what war actually meant. They had been suspecting that this 
        would be coming for a long time, even before Hitler's Panzers had rolled 
        into the Lowlands. When the blow came it came from another direction-from 
        the Japanese Empire-but the war was now to be waged on two fronts and 
        the men of the College knew that they would somehow find the courage in 
        themselves to face this monumentous challenge. As the College prepared 
        to close its doors for winter break, no doubt after an extremely difficult 
        exam season, President Sills reminded the students:</p>
      <p align="left">
        As you go home for the holidays, which will be very different from any 
        you have known, with fewer parties, curtailed entertainments, and sobriety 
        in the air, do not forget to carry with you from the College a message 
        of abiding faith and confidence of a fuller understanding of what this 
        country stands for, and of a resolution to do all that you personally 
        can do to extend the liberties of the Bill of Rights so that ultimately 
        the world may not only have freedom of speech and expression and freedom 
        of worship, but freedom from care and freedom from fear. So help us God.</p>
      <p align="left">
        When students returned from break they found that the campus had changed-facilities 
        crews had made sure that, in the event of an enemy attack on the town, 
        the campus would be ready. All buildings were equipped with sand-&quot;to 
        extinguish incendiary bombs&quot;-shovels and axes. All attics were used 
        to store piping, faucets and hoses while dorms had stirrup pumps and auxiliary 
        lighting systems. To help the College further cut unnecessary costs, some 
        fraternities like the Delta Upsilons and the Zeta Psis combined their 
        dining programs while the Moulton Union Dining Hall was shut down during 
        the summer to help fraternity diners attract more students.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Academically, the College shifted from a two to a three-semester program-the 
        summer session began in June 1942-and faculty members were asked to accelerate 
        their courses. General examinations were cancelled while the requirement 
        that students know two elementary modern languages-French and German-was 
        changed so that an advanced ability in one of the two was now needed for 
        graduation. The athletic program was given the task of rigorously training 
        the students, preparing them for military service. New obstacle courses 
        were put in for the returning students and a new intensive swimming course 
        was also offered. The year 1942 saw Bowdoin College preparing its sons 
        for a prolonged conflict.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the College started the spring semester, Dean of the College Paul Nixon 
        reminded the students not to make hasty decisions about the future. &quot;There 
        may be some students who, at present, are seriously considering some unwise 
        move,&quot; he said. &quot;I urge such of you to give us older men a chance 
        to discuss with you your individual cases before you act.&quot; The Dean 
        gave his reasoning: &quot;it is my guess that before this war is over, 
        the country will need all the young fellows of your sort it has, and will 
        need them in the places for which they are best adapted by as full an 
        academic training as time permits.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Often, College officials urged students to stay in school but that is 
        not to say that the College did not aid its youngsters in choosing their 
        best career paths. The College played host to a number of armed forces 
        recruiters; one of which was from the Marine Corps and was in fact, one 
        of their own. Everett P. Pope, a graduate from the Class of 1941, returned 
        to the campus as a recruiter. Pope had graduated the previous summer and 
        had joined the Marines. He had survived boot camp and Officers Candidate 
        School (OCS). Receiving his commission as a Second Lieutenant, Pope worked 
        out of an office in Augusta and in the spring of 1942, attempted to persuade 
        other young men of the opportunities that the Corps offered. He visited 
        colleges and universities in Maine, receiving a warm welcome at his alma 
        mater. &quot;I worked as a leader of a small team,&quot; remembered Pope, 
        &quot;which included a Sergeant, which could do the administrative paperwork 
        and a Navy doctor who could do the necessary physical examinations so 
        that if we had a candidate&#133; if he was agreeable&#133;we could recruit 
        him and sign him up very quickly.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        For graduates or for those students who decided that they wanted to go 
        into the service of their country despite the College's pleas, administrative 
        officers helped out in another way-recommendation letters. At the start 
        of the Second World War, all branches of the Armed Forces desperately 
        needed intelligent, college trained individuals. These were the men that 
        were needed to lead other troops-future second lieutenants and ensigns. 
        To qualify for commissioned ranks, applicants needed to pass rigorous 
        courses as well as go through boot camp. Other requirements included academic 
        transcripts and letters of recommendation. Stephen B. Blodgett of the 
        Class of 1942 wrote such a letter requesting a recommendation from Dean 
        Nixon. &quot;Bowdoin men have a habit-they are called by the dean only 
        when they are in trouble,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and they call on the dean 
        only when they want something (are in trouble again).&quot; President 
        Sills' recommendation for David Dickson of the Class of 1941 is typical 
        of such letters:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mr. David W. D. Dickson, of Bowdoin College, informs me that he is applying 
        for enlistment in the United States Naval Reserve Class V-7. Mr. Dickson 
        is at the head of his class after three years of excellent work at Bowdoin. 
        He has taken part in athletic activities also. He is a young man of the 
        highest character and I am very glad indeed to commend him.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many of those former students, who found their way into the Armed Forces, 
        often wrote back to the College of their experiences. President Sills 
        and Dean Nixon were the primary recipients of these letters but other 
        professors also got mail from their former students-perhaps a testament 
        to how close the Bowdoin community was during the era. As their experiences 
        in training camp were often novel, a number of Bowdoin men wrote about 
        their schedules and training. Walter M. Bush of the Class of 1940 described 
        his basic training to President Sills:</p>
      <p align="left">
        So far we're all still pretty green. The emphasis has been largely on 
        drilling, though we've finished our bayonet training and have been through 
        the gas chamber. Incidentally, we had to run through a room filled with 
        tear-gas, and believe me I shall never doubt its effectiveness.</p>
