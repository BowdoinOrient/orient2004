      <p align="left"> &quot;Tolerance&quot; is a fairly common word today. Educational 
        and civic leaders often admonish their charges or citizens to &quot;tolerate&quot; 
        those that differ from them in race, religion, or creed. This message 
        is especially important today as we face uncertainty and violence in various 
        parts of the globe, such as Iraq and the Middle East. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In times such as these, it is tempting to embrace narrow worldviews that 
        respect only those who share our pigmentation or piety. Thankfully, we 
        approach the anniversary of a monumental act of both courage and tolerance 
        onboard a United States military ship during World War II, from which 
        we can obtain guidance in these troubled times. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On February 3, 1943, a German torpedo nailed the American troopship U.S.S. 
        Dorchester as she traversed waters about 100 miles off Greenland. As oil 
        and ammonia began gushing from the ship's side, the sailors could sense 
        the ship's demise and their likely death. </p>
      <p align="left">
        According to the website of the Immortal Chaplains Foundation, the ship's 
        four chaplains, Father John Washington (Catholic), Reverend Clark Poling 
        (Dutch Reformed), Rabbi Alexander Goode (Jewish), and Reverend George 
        Fox (Methodist), were the &quot;first on deck&quot; and began to comfort 
        the men and distribute lifejackets. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Soon after the torpedo blast, the chaplains ran out of lifejackets. In 
        a selfless and courageous act of love and tolerance, all four of the chaplains 
        removed their own lifejackets and gave them to waiting sailors. They performed 
        this act &quot;without regard to faith or race.&quot; The courageous chaplains 
        died along with nearly 700 other men on the ship. An eyewitness describes 
        the chaplains as all &quot;standing arm-in-arm on the hull of the ship, 
        each praying in his own way for the care of the men.&quot; The attack 
        became the third deadliest U.S. Naval disaster during World War II. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These four courageous men of God were not forgotten after their deaths. 
        The U.S. Post Office issued a &quot;Four Chaplains&quot; stamp in 1948. 
        In 1960, Congress awarded a medal of honor to the families of the four 
        &quot;Immortal Chaplains&quot; that commemorated their valor. Their faces 
        adorn stained-glass windows at chapels both in Fort Snelling, Minnesota 
        and the Pentagon. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Their legacies of both courage and tolerance are still remembered today 
        through the Immortal Chaplains Foundation. The foundation began in 1997 
        as a way of spreading the message of tolerance and compassion toward people 
        of all religions, races, and creeds. The Foundation's board has dignitaries 
        such as Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmund Tutu and former Vice President 
        Walter Mondale, along with descendents of the Four Chaplains and surviving 
        members of both the Dorchester and the German U-Boat that sank the Dorchester. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Each year, the Foundation awards the Prize for Humanity to those who &quot;risked 
        all to protect others of a different faith or race.&quot; Last year's 
        prize went to Father Mychal Judge, the chaplain of the New York Fire Department 
        who died while comforting a fallen firefighter in the World Trade Center 
        on September 11, 2001. The other recipient was a Palestinian man named 
        Omri Abdel-Halim Al-Jada who drowned while saving the life of a Jewish 
        child in Lake Tiberius. This year's prize will go to &quot;the courageous 
        villagers of Le Chambon, France&quot; who sheltered many Jewish refugees 
        during World War II and to the &quot;service volunteers of World War II&quot; 
        who drove ambulances and provided other forms of &quot;non-combative support&quot; 
        to fighting soldiers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Archbishop Tutu, himself a recipient of the prize, commends the Foundation 
        and its goal. &quot;I am proud to be associated with the Foundation established 
        to recognize [the chaplains'] sacrifice and to promote a culture of tolerance 
        and understanding&#133;.In acknowledging our common humanity, we can build 
        a better world.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In this time of global trouble and uncertainty, it behooves us all to 
        remember the Four Chaplains and their extraordinary display of courage, 
        compassion, and tolerance in the face of death.</p>
