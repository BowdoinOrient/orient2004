      <p align="left">Opting to live in the &quot;Bowdoin Bubble&quot; makes long 
        distance calling a fixture of communication for the majority of students. 
        Despite the fact that the school provides students with a long distance 
        service, a growing number of students have shifted away from using the 
        long distance plan provided by the school and have opted to utilize calling 
        plans of their own.</p>
      <p align="left">
        System Administrator and Trainer for C.I.S. Lueree Horton explained, &quot;We've 
        seen a huge drop in recent years with people using the AT&amp;T ACUS service. 
        There has easily been an 80 percent decrease over the past three or four 
        years.&quot; &quot;It used to be that about three-quarters of the student 
        body participated in ACUS, but the numbers now are much lower. Long distance 
        used to be huge revenue that is non-existent recently.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Upon enrolling in the college, all Bowdoin students are signed up for 
        the basic AT&amp;T ACUS plan, and are given the option of using their 
        personal account. The initial rate charged to students is 15 cents a minute, 
        while multiple other calling plans offer cheaper rates for all calls.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In order to receive any lower-priced plan, however, students must determine 
        which plan suits their needs best and then contact AT&amp;T to inform 
        the company of their intent to change billing plans. Rates run as low 
        as five cents a minute for state-to-state calling, and eight cents a minute 
        for calls within the state of Maine.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mason Miller '05 used to use the AT&amp;T ACUS plan but now uses either 
        a phone card or a cell phone since &quot;it's a lot cheaper than ACUS. 
        ACUS is a hassle with all the codes.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's ridiculous that they make you change your rate from 15 cents 
        a minute to a lower amount&#133;campus long-distance shouldn't be a money-making 
        scheme.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Horton admitted that the system can be, at times, &quot;purposely confusing.&quot; 
        She also remarked that &quot;it takes a bit of an effort to figure out 
        your calling patterns and then translate that into what plan would provide 
        you with the cheapest service.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other students have found ACUS to be perfectly suitable to their calling 
        needs. Jake Claghorn '04 said that he has been quite content with the 
        school's long distance service. &quot;They have good rates and I haven't 
        ever had a problem with ACUS,&quot; he remarked.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bruce Courtney '06 said that ACUS &quot;has always worked for me, although 
        I don't use it often.&quot; He cited his preference for the billing plan 
        provided by AT&amp;T ACUS, stating, &quot;In many respects it's better 
        to have the Bowdoin long distance service since there is no fixed monthly 
        rate.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Rather than the ACUS system, many students use calling cards because they 
        receive lower rates than through the campus phone card system. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Mark Krempley '06 said, &quot;It's cheaper, and I already knew how to 
        use it. I didn't look into using the school plan because I'd used the 
        card before a lot and I knew it had a good rate.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Cell phones have also become more common in recent years, a trend that 
        is reflected among Bowdoin students. Maggie Fitzgerald '06 said that she 
        uses a cell phone because &quot;I get unlimited long distance minutes 
        and reduced rates at nights and on weekends.&quot; She said that this 
        is generally when she makes most of her calls.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Additionally, students have turned to various other options in order to 
        avoid using the school program. One student, who wishes to remain anonymous, 
        uses the website ww.bigzoo.com. The site bills long distance calls to 
        a credit card. &quot;The school plan is absurdly expensive,&quot; she 
        said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although many students have turned to other long-distance options, Horton 
        said that she &quot;[has] not heard many complaints&quot; from those that 
        do use ACUS. She said that personally, she has been &quot;very happy with 
        AT&amp;T ACUS&#133;[the plan] is attractive in that it provides customer 
        support for students at all times of day, they handle all the billing 
        and the servicing of student accounts.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin &quot;has never looked at long distance as a revenue service,&quot; 
        said Horton. &quot;Long distance is a part of being here, and we look 
        for the most effective way to provide services.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The college has used ACUS for the past seven years and is currently in 
        the final year of a three-year contract. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Bowdoin has been good about staying competitive,&quot; Horton said. 
        &quot;We have always looked for the best rates and compared our plans 
        to those of other schools.&quot;</p>
