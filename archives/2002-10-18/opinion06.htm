        <font size="2">MACAELA FLANAGAN</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Fact: a party can only be successful if the music is fun. 
        When people at a party are lame, you can simply avoid them. But when the 
        music is lame, you are forced to listen to it, and, chances are, have 
        some god-awful song reverberating in your head for the next twenty-four 
        hours. There are many different types of parties, and many different types 
        of music. My question: can there be a perfect song for a generic party 
        (just so we're all on the same page, we'll narrow down the question of 
        a perfect party to be the infamous Bowdoin campuswide)?</p>
      <p align="left">The Perfect Party Song must meet several standards. Firstly, 
        and perhaps most importantly, it's got to be a little bit sexy. Not in-your-face 
        sexy but subtle enough so that you start thinking &quot;I'm looking hot 
        tonight,&quot; before you realize the music is actually hypnotizing you 
        to come to terms with your good-looking-ness. This does not imply that 
        everyone at a party should be worrying about being gorgeous, it simply 
        means that a good song makes you feel confident. And who doesn't go to 
        a party to feel good? So, there are some songs that are voted off the 
        list here because they either are A) too sexy, or B) not sexy enough. 
        Songs falling under category A would be something along the lines of &quot;Let's 
        Get It On&quot; by Marvin Gaye; a great song, but just too sexy for a 
        generic party. For category B think Phish: great band, but that whole 
        sexy thing isn't their strong point.</p>
      <p align="left">The second bit of criteria: the Perfect Party Song must 
        be fun. Call me shallow, but after a rigorous week of classes, it's nice 
        to give your brain a rest. That said, I don't want to hear some heavy 
        lyrics about some depressing topic. I want something, well, light. This 
        is not the time for Rage Against the Machine. Again, while I respect any 
        musician who addresses worldly concerns in their music, it doesn't always 
        make for an easy-going Saturday night.</p>
      <p align="left">Standard number three is tricky, but very important. The 
        Perfect Party Song must be catchy, but not annoyingly so. The Perfect 
        Party Song does not discriminate: I don't care if you are Janet Jackson 
        or Janet Reno, you should feel encouraged to dance to this song without 
        making an ass of yourself. The beat, therefore, has to be danceable and 
        lively. The trickiness comes in here-the song must make you want to dance, 
        but not have a beat that is so blunt you feel like a robot. We'd have 
        to skip &quot;Closer&quot; by Nine Inch Nails; great tune, but we want 
        some variation in our movements tonight (not to mention that &quot;Closer&quot; 
        was definitely crossed off the list when it violated the too sexy rule).</p>
      <p align="left">The hardest standard to meet is the song's ability to appeal 
        to everyone. I'm an optimist, but I know for a fact that not everyone 
        can like one song. But hey, this is my article and it is in the Opinion 
        section, so I can pretend I know what people find appealing.</p>
      <p align="left">The Perfect Party Song cannot, I repeat CANNOT, be a fad. 
        It must be timeless. I am not saying it has to be old, but if you think 
        Shakira is going to be on this list you couldn't be more wrong. Also, 
        it can't be dated. While I am sure everyone in the senior class has a 
        special place in their heart for Prince's &quot;Party Like it is 1999,&quot; 
        it is now 2002. It just doesn't have that same zing anymore. In order 
        for the Perfect Party Song to reach a large audience, one must lean away 
        from their own guilty pleasures. That means I would not be allowed to 
        break out the Neil Diamond. Yes, I actually enjoy him.</p>
      <p align="left">It is now time to tally the results. Let's lay out the typical 
        Bowdoin campus wide&#133;.I recall lots of Brittney Spears. I am not even 
        going to discuss why she is not on the list because if you think she has 
        the Perfect Party Song, then writing this article was a waste of my time. 
        &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; by Madonna, is a popular campus-wide number. 
        This one actually adds up quite well; it's pretty close to being the Perfect 
        Party Song, but it lacks a little something. Runners up include &quot;Start 
        Me Up&quot; by the Rolling Stones and &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; 
        by Guns N' Roses.</p>
      <p align="left">After weighing the facts, and if you haven't guessed it 
        by now, the Perfect Party Song undeniably has to be &quot;You Shook Me 
        All Night Long&quot; by ACDC. Why? Well, it's sexy (but in a goofy sort 
        of way, so it avoids being too sexy), it's a hell of a lot of fun to dance 
        to, it has withstood the test of time, and I don't care if you're a Top 
        40-Tiger Beat-reading popster or if you own 400 obscure CDs and haven't 
        listened to the radio in ten years: you all know the words; so go out 
        shake it.</p>
