      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>After perusing around campus and through Smith Union this past week during 
        daily routines, my eyes required several minutes of adjustment. At every 
        corner, I encountered rainbow streamers and signs exclaiming &quot;Gay 
        Friendly Space&quot; in honor of this week's national theme: coming out 
        of the closet and embracing one's gay identity. Why such a feat is funneled 
        into one heightened week of primary colors, I am still trying to decipher.</p>
      <p>As an openly gay individual, these screaming proclamations of my sexual 
        identity caused waves of slight agitation. I have been constantly thinking 
        to myself over the past week, &quot;Isn't Bowdoin already supposed to 
        be a place of acceptance and friendliness towards gays? If we are trying 
        to change something, then what is currently wrong?&quot; In my opinion, 
        such extreme visible actions do not succeed in unifying this campus, but 
        rather divide the student body. Vulgar chalk images merely propagate stereotypes 
        about gays being overly sexual and perverse. For those among us in the 
        Bowdoin community who do not accept or embrace homosexuality, these visuals 
        only serve to reinforce dangerous binarisms and increasingly portray gays, 
        lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered individuals as &quot;foreign,&quot; 
        &quot;other-worldly,&quot; or &quot;sick,&quot; and as people that requires 
        forced acceptance. My rewarding experiences and friendships with many 
        diverse people at Bowdoin, though challenging at times, have been anything 
        but forced.</p>
      <p>I am, and will continue to be, an avid supporter of gay rights and gay 
        equality. After all, many aspects of my life are dependent on such social 
        phenomena. Sexual preference, though highly cultural, is also a personal 
        identity. It need not be the first thing that you introduce about yourself, 
        especially in an intellectual or professional environment. My ideals have 
        always encouraged me to get to know people first and foremost and then 
        to celebrate their individuality. I believe that most people at this school 
        conduct their relationships in a similar fashion. Although I commend such 
        groups as the Gay-Straight Alliance and other cultural organizations for 
        their accomplishments and support, we are all far more than images of 
        the rainbow or resentful sex-driven statements and need not restrict ourselves 
        to the community as such. In fact, to do so in such a contrived manner 
        is counterproductive and entirely unnecessary at Bowdoin College. Of course 
        sexuality is an issue to be discussed, but do we really need to revert 
        back to the employment of simple childlike images in order to establish 
        a unifying discourse? I certainly hope not.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Finding the unexpected right here</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Upon reading &quot;Experiencing the Unexpected,&quot; a feature in a 
        recent issue of the Orient, I found myself wondering why Todd Johnston, 
        along with many other curious Bowdoin students, seek these unique experiences 
        in such geographically remote places. While I agree that traveling to 
        other countries provides an important opportunity to gain a better understanding 
        of other cultures and ourselves, what is wrong with looking for these 
        unexpected experiences in our own backyard? Why can't we, as members of 
        the Brunswick community take a vacation, or in this case a brief walk, 
        into the neighborhood and simply initiate a dialogue with people? Let 
        me assure you that in many cases you will discover the unexpected in a 
        way that hits home in a more direct manner than learning that many people 
        don't speak English in China.</p>
      <p>It has always struck me as an odd irony that Bowdoin students are very 
        interested in understanding and actively participating in issues pertaining 
        to the world's problems, yet the complexities and tensions of our local 
        community go unnoticed. I will admit that I myself fall victim to this 
        irony. I don't have any clear solutions, but I merely wish to address 
        this phenomenon and challenge myself and the Bowdoin community to learn 
        about the lives of our neighbors, which in many cases prove to be very 
        different from our own.</p>
      <p>On a campus that seems to pride itself on seeking out diversity and understanding 
        other cultures, I find it interesting to note how this effort affects 
        our conception of community involvement and service. I would argue that 
        many of the more visible forms of community service on this campus involve 
        actively helping out individuals of geographically distant cultures. While 
        I admire and encourage the efforts of those involved in these activities, 
        I can't help but be weary of some of the underlying thoughts behind these 
        acts of compassion. I fear that some may view these cultures as exotic, 
        or put another way, that which encompasses the &quot;other&quot;. This 
        manner of thinking serves to distance us from these cultures, creating 
        a dangerous binarism in which we establish a relationship in which it 
        is &quot;us&quot; helping &quot;them&quot;. In terms of comfort zones, 
        we find it easier to help these people who retain a certain degree of 
        separation.</p>
      <p>But what about the diverse group of people living in Brunswick who have 
        the same color skin and shop in the same stores as we do? Why the hesitation 
        to expose ourselves to the unexpected that manifests itself in our daily 
        lives? How is it that our comfort zone can extend to a group of people 
        thousands of miles away and not to the person that just walked past you 
        on Maine Street? In terms of the formulation of binarisms, are the residents 
        of Brunswick &quot;us&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, or do they occupy a gray 
        area in between? I don't have answers to these questions, but by the sheer 
        virtue of thinking about these issues, perhaps we can begin to realize 
        the great and direct opportunity the community has to offer us, and reciprocally, 
        acknowledge our obligation to contribute to our own neighborhood. </p>
      <p>All things said, I would like to applaud the many Bowdoin students who 
        have already taken this critical step and have actively contributed to 
        realizing the benefits of local interaction and service. Also, I don't 
        want to take anything away from those who have discovered the joys of 
        embracing the unexpected at a more global scale, as this also addresses 
        important issues. Action is always superior to inaction. I merely want 
        to challenge myself (a relatively non-active proponent of community service) 
        and others to think about the virtues of community involvement at the 
        local and global levels.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, these thoughts will help lead to more enriching active participation 
        that will benefit both the Brunswick and world community.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors: </p>
      <p align="left">In January 2002, an Op Ed written by Bowdoin Professor David 
        Page appeared in the <i>Anchorage Daily News</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">The piece criticized new research that showed that the 1989 
        Exxon Valdex (sic.) oil spill continues to plague the Prince William Sound 
        ecosystem. </p>
      <p align="left">In a common industry strategy used when science won't suffice, 
        Dr. Page attacked the credibility of the study's author, and questioned 
        the veracity of his research. Dr. Page's serious allegations led to an 
        inquiry. Now, however, an independent review of the study by the National 
        Academy of Sciences, among others, has vindicated the research, describing 
        it as &quot;rigorous, well designed and executed.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">While there should always be room for open and honest scientific 
        debate, legitimate concerns arise as industry-funded scientists resort 
        to barroom tactics to discredit research with which they disagree. A review 
        of <a href="http://academic.bowdoin.edu/faculty/D/dpage/html/oilspill.shtml" target="_blank">Professor 
        Page's site</a> provides a laundry list of oil companies that have funded 
        his work, including Exxon, Amoco Transport, Mobil Foundation, Texaco, 
        Chevron, Olympic Petroleum and the American Petroleum Institute. </p>
      <p align="left">Just like we don't want Enron making national energy policy, 
        so too should we give careful consideration to oil industry-funded research 
        when assessing oil spill effects. </p>
      <p align="left">Academic freedom and rigorous scientific debate are cornerstones 
        of our American education system. For this very reason, students, faculty 
        and administrators alike have a duty to ask hard questions about oil industry-funded 
        research at Bowdoin College. </p>

      <p><i>EDITOR'S NOTE: Professor David Page replies: (T)he letter from this 
        person...contains numerous inaccuracies and is misleading. For example, 
        the National Academy of Science (sic.) declined to review the work that 
        I rightly criticized. Our work has also been supported over the years 
        by many non-industry sources, including the State of Maine--hardly an 
        industry group. I don't think the </i>Orient<i> does its readership a 
        service by providing a platform for those engaging in eco-politics. It 
        is unfortunate that you're publishing this. </i></p>
