        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> The last two fall breaks I have hosted large groups of 
        friends in my hometown, which is near Acadia National Park. Each year 
        we have been amidst the calm of the park while storms were developing 
        in the political world. Last year, on a crisp and clear autumn day, we 
        sat in a Bar Harbor caf&eacute; as word arrived that the United States 
        was beginning its bombing in Afghanistan. </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the anxiety following the attacks of September 11, 
        the nation's sense of clarity and purpose was defined. We had been attacked 
        and we were &quot;bringing justice&quot; to those who had attacked us. 
        <br>
        This year most of our time in Acadia was spent under cloudy skies and 
        I couldn't help but view the weather as a metaphor for the political times 
        in which we live today. Ours is a world that is gray, cloudy, and uncertain. 
        The clarity of purpose that encompassed all of our military activities 
        last year has mostly evaporated. Our country is nearly evenly divided 
        on the merits of a war against Iraq. </p>
      <p align="left">I do not say this as a way of asserting moral superiority 
        over those who oppose an attack on Iraq. This imminent war is not as clearly 
        justified as the invasion of Afghanistan was last year. This is an attack 
        that warrants thoughtful and reasoned debate and we should not judge each 
        other's &quot;patriotism&quot; based on opinions in this war. However, 
        I believe an attack on Iraq is appropriate. </p>
      <p align="left">President Bush outlines the justification for an attack 
        on the notion that Hussein is evil and is amassing weapons of mass of 
        destruction. Bush defends these accusations fairly well. It is common 
        knowledge that Hussein has engaged in mass genocide against his own people 
        as is beautifully and graphically outlined in an article by Jeffrey Goldberg 
        in The New Yorker last March. </p>
      <p align="left">Hussein has not allowed weapons inspectors into his country 
        since 1998; this is a direct violation of U.N. resolutions that Iraq signed 
        allowing for the end of the 1991 Gulf War. Therefore it is likely that 
        Hussein is cultivating weapons of mass destruction, which could include 
        chemical weapons, biological weapons, and perhaps even nuclear weapons. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some argue that Hussein is a survivalist; he will not attack 
        aggressively and thus we should not provoke him with an invasion. I disagree 
        with this for two reasons. </p>
      <p align="left">First of all, he has attacked aggressively. He invaded Kuwait 
        in August of 1990, which prompted the U.N. resolution authorizing the 
        Gulf War. Secondly, we cannot allow him to collect weapons of mass destruction 
        because even if he doesn't use them himself, he could potentially hand 
        them off to Al-Qaeda or other terrorist networks. </p>
      <p align="left">We also know that Hussein attempted to cultivate nuclear 
        weapons in the early 1980s but a covert Israeli raid thwarted that effort. 
        As George Will pointed out in a November 2001 column, Hussein's lack of 
        a nuke made our invasion of Iraq easier during the Gulf War. Therefore, 
        it is imperative that we keep Hussein from acquiring a nuclear weapon 
        because if he has one, he could invade his neighbors with impunity.</p>
      <p align="left">Regardless of his actual arsenal, we cannot allow Saddam 
        Hussein to stay in power because to do so would undermine the relevance 
        of the United Nations. Hussein has repeatedly defied the United Nations 
        since agreeing to resolutions allowing for an end to the Gulf War. If 
        the United Nations will not force him to comply with unfettered weapons 
        inspections or authorize his removal from power than they are truly &quot;irrelevant&quot; 
        as President Bush intimated in his September 12 speech to the U.N. General 
        Assembly. The United Nations must recognize that sometimes force is required 
        to secure global stability.</p>
      <p align="left">Sitting anywhere in Acadia National Park reminds one both 
        of man's meekness among nature's largesse and of the fortune that we have 
        in the United States to possess the foresight and prosperity to preserve 
        such lands. Tyrants do not respect nature and Saddam Hussein is a tyrant 
        whose reign in Iraq threatens the security of the United States and the 
        world. Allowing him to cultivate weapons of mass destruction not only 
        makes our buildings, airplanes, and transportation vulnerable, it also 
        threatens our freedom to enjoy the small things in life, such as national 
        parks. </p>
      <p align="left">Seeing the beaming smiles of dozens of my friends this past 
        weekend, I know that these small pleasures, national parks, community 
        theaters, little league baseball, etc. are what stimulate and define us 
        as Americans, and that we must fight to save them before Saddam, or a 
        beneficiary of his malicious generosity such as Al-Qaeda, robs us of our 
        soul. </p>
