      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;Is the &quot;Morning After Pill&quot; 
        available at the Health Center? Are there any side effects?&quot; M.W.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

      </table>
      <p>Dear M.W.: All &quot;Morning-After Pills&quot; (&quot;Emergency Contraception&quot; 
        or EC) contain some combination of progesterone and/or estrogen. Multiple 
        doses of birth control pills can be taken for this purpose, but cause 
        considerable side effects. &quot;Plan B&quot; contains only the progestin, 
        levonorgestrel, which has far fewer side effects, and is the most effective 
        form of EC available in this country. Plan B is the formulation we dispense 
        at the Health Center. </p>
      <p>Plan B is generally very well tolerated. Common side effects include 
        mild nausea, mild fatigue and breast tenderness. The medication may throw 
        off the timing of your next period, making it either earlier or later 
        than expected. If it is delayed more than three weeks after taking Plan 
        B, you'd need to return to the Health Center for a pregnancy test (as 
        always, free and confidential).</p>
      <p>The exact mechanism of action of EC is complex. Human and animal studies 
        have shown effects at several stages of the reproductive cycle: ovulation, 
        fertilization, egg transport and hormonal support, and implantation. If 
        the timing is right, like regular birth control pills, EC will suppress 
        ovulation and cause changes in cervical mucus that make it impenetrable 
        to sperm. It will also impede transport of a fertilized egg through the 
        fallopian tubes to the uterus, as well as implantation of the egg in the 
        endometrial lining of the uterus. None of these medications will harm 
        an implanted embryo.</p>
      <p>All forms of emergency contraception should be taken as soon as possible 
        after unprotected intercourse. A second dose needs to be taken 12 hours 
        after the initial dose. The sooner EC is taken, the more effective it 
        is. While this was always intuitively clear, recent studies have demonstrated 
        that every 12-hour delay in starting EC may decrease its effectiveness 
        by as much as 50 percent.</p>
      <p>Emergency contraceptive pills are available in the U.S. only by prescription. 
        There has been much discussion about how to improve women's ease, speed 
        and cost of access to EC. In three states now (California, Washington 
        and Hawaii), women are able to obtain emergency contraception directly 
        from pharmacists without having to visit a clinic or health care provider 
        first. </p>
      <p>Plan B has been available at the Health Center for some time. It is one 
        of our in-house formulary medications, and we dispense it to students 
        free of charge. We would like all women to have some Plan B on hand, in 
        their medicine cabinets, immediately available, &quot;just in case.&quot; 
        Our goal is to have all women who might be at risk for unprotected intercourse 
        (even if they have never had sex before, and even if they are taking birth 
        control pills) to have Plan B on hand, before they have a need for it. 
      </p>
      <p>You can make an appointment any weekday, at a time convenient to you, 
        for a brief visit with any of our staff, and pick up some Plan B. We will 
        only ask you a few questions about your health and give you directions 
        on how to take the medication. You will not need a GYN exam, and as always, 
        your visit will be confidential and free.</p>
      <p>We will also be setting up special &quot;EC Clinics,&quot; when we'll 
        be able to streamline visits and dispense Plan B more efficiently.</p>
      <p>Remember, the sooner after unprotected intercourse Plan B is started, 
        the more effective it is. </p>
      <p>If 100 women have completely unprotected intercourse during the second 
        or third week of their cycles, studies have shown that 8 will likely conceive. 
        Plan B is 89% effective, and so reduces this number to one.</p>
      <p>Three million unintended pregnancies occur each year in this country. 
        Half of all American women will have at least one unintended pregnancy. 
        The majority of these women use a regular method of contraception, none 
        of which, unfortunately, is 100% effective. Accidents happen: condoms 
        break, diaphragms slip, birth control pills are sometimes forgotten. Sometimes 
        sex is unplanned - or unwanted. Very sadly, each year, thousands of American 
        women are the victims of rape. Emergency contraception can at least help 
        eliminate one associated trauma - the prospect of an unwanted pregnancy. 
      </p>
      <p>At the Health Center, we consider emergency contraception a safe, effective, 
        back-up birth control method. By delaying or inhibiting ovulation or fertilization, 
        or preventing transport or implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, 
        EC prevents pregnancy. Emergency contraception will not interrupt a pregnancy, 
        and it will not harm a developing fetus.</p>
      <p>Come on in to see us and pick up your Plan B!</p>
