      <p align="left"><font size="5">D.C. sniper has America up in arms, spurs debate<br>
        <font size="2">GIL BARNDOLLAR</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> At the time of this writing, the D.C. sniper has killed 
        nine and wounded two, terrorizing our nation's capital in the process. 
        By choosing completely random victims, the sniper has driven people in 
        the D.C. suburbs indoors and created a climate of fear as roadblocks and 
        police helicopters have become common sights. It has been two weeks since 
        the killings began, and the police have no suspect. Yet in spite of the 
        failure of the authorities to stop this deranged killer, the response 
        of many in America, particularly those on the left, is to call in the 
        government.</p>
      <p align="left">At a time when America has far more pressing issues to deal 
        with, the D.C. sniper has unfortunately re-ignited the national debate 
        on gun control. The usual suspects are all here: Sarah Brady, formerly 
        of Handgun Control Inc., quickly wrote that &quot;As police try to track 
        down and stop this killer, we do know this: sensible gun laws can help 
        law enforcement solve crimes as well as prevent gun violence.&quot; The 
        Brady Bill's &quot;sensible&quot; waiting periods could do nothing to 
        prevent this kind of crime, a point even the most ardent anti-gun activist 
        would have to concede. New York Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy took the 
        questions from the ridiculous to the sublime, asking, &quot;Did he buy 
        his gun at a gun show? Did he go through one of the loopholes that we 
        have been trying to close?&quot; Does that matter in any way?</p>
      <p align="left">For the opponents of the Second Amendment, facts are irrelevant. 
        Never mind that the D.C. sniper is using a rifle, not the &quot;cheap, 
        deadly handguns&quot; that are supposedly the bane of American society. 
        Never mind that waiting periods or even probably background checks would 
        do nothing to stop a murderer like this. And never mind that Maryland, 
        where several of the shootings took place, has some of the most restrictive 
        gun laws in the nation. For the well-intentioned idiots who brought you 
        the Brady Bill and the Million Mom March, the only solution is more gun 
        control.</p>
      <p align="left">To stop future &quot;snipers,&quot; the new gun control 
        proposal is a federal law requiring ballistic fingerprinting of guns, 
        giving each bullet fired by a particular gun a distinctive mark. Forensics 
        experts could then examine bullets found at a crime scene to find a match 
        in a computer database. Predictably, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening 
        is already pushing to expand his state's ballistic fingerprinting laws, 
        and is urging the adoption of a nationwide program. There's only one problem 
        with this new system: it probably won't work. Kevin Watson, legislative 
        director for the Law Enforcement Alliance of America (LEAA), an organization 
        of current and former law enforcement officers, had this to say about 
        ballistic fingerprinting: &quot;It sounds really neat when you hear just 
        the basic description of it, but when you go into the description of how 
        it would actually work it kind of falls apart.&quot; In most guns, it 
        is relatively easy for criminals to change the ballistic fingerprint, 
        or damage it enough to make it unrecognizable. Watson even says the name 
        &quot;ballistic fingerprinting&quot; is a misnomer. &quot;Imagine a fingerprint 
        database where people can switch their fingerprints and their own fingerprints 
        wear down over time after use,&quot; he says. &quot;It makes it not that 
        useful of a system.&quot; And, of course, there are at least 200 million 
        firearms in this country that don't have ballistic fingerprints. Any attempt 
        to order the fingerprinting of lawfully owned firearms would be justifiably 
        resisted; fingerprinting of all old guns would create a central registry 
        of gun owners, which should terrify anyone who noticed what happened at 
        Ruby Ridge and Waco just a few years ago.</p>
      <p align="left">Luckily for Americans and for the Constitution, we have 
        a president in office who is firmly wedded to the defense of the right 
        to bear arms. For the first time, the Justice Department defined the Second 
        Amendment as guaranteeing the right to private gun ownership. But with 
        an election just a couple of weeks away and renewed hysteria about guns, 
        the possibility of further unconstitutional restrictions on firearm ownership 
        remains. That these new laws will not reduce crime is more than a possibility; 
        it is a virtual certainty. Virginia Governor Mark Warner probably put 
        it best: &quot;Let's face it ... this individual-clearly no law is going 
        to stop him.&quot;</p>
