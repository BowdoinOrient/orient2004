      <p align="left">Bowdoin's Sarah and James Bowdoin Day exercises were held 
        Friday, October 4, in Morrell Gymnasium, to recognize the College's highest-ranking 
        scholars. A total of 304 students were named Sarah and James Bowdoin Scholars, 
        with 48 of the Scholars earning Book Awards.</p>
      <p align="left">In his welcoming remarks, President Barry Mills recounted 
        the history of the Bowdoin family: &quot;Today we remember our founders 
        and meet to celebrate the achievements of our scholars&#133;. [Our students] 
        are what Bowdoin is all about, &#133;a community of informed individuals&#133;[who 
        develop] judgment and sensitivity&#133;and understand other points of 
        view.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">On Sarah and James Bowdoin Day, held during Parents Weekend, 
        speeches are delivered by an outstanding student and a highly recognized 
        practitioner in one of the liberal arts disciplines. This year's speakers 
        were Carolyn Dion '05 and Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, President of the University 
        of Maryland, Baltimore County.</p>
      <p align="left">Dion, a Latin scholar who plans to major in classics and 
        minor in economics, gave a speech titled &quot;Taking it With You.&quot; 
        She spoke about her summer internship at a Boston brokerage firm, where 
        she found herself filing papers all day (&quot;rediscovering the alphabet&quot;) 
        alongside former Ivy Leaguers and business school graduates still scraping 
        to get ahead despite eight years of college.</p>
      <p align="left">While her first real encounter with the business world left 
        her leery, she stressed that her liberal arts education and study of Latin 
        would well prepare her to maintain an even keel through life: &quot;As 
        Cicero would say, 'If wisdom is attainable, let us not only win, but enjoy 
        it.'&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Hrabowski delivered the talk &quot;Education for the 21st 
        Century: Creating a Climate of Success for All Students,&quot; and encouraged 
        students to ask &quot;who am I, why am I here, what's the significance 
        of this experience and education, and where will it lead us?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Take the time to think about the significance of a 
        college education,&quot; he said. &quot;In education the idea has to be 
        'I'm here to see the light.' You're here to learn, to think, to read about 
        ideas of all types, to learn about you and the people around you&#133;.Get 
        to know people from all over the world, appreciate the differences in 
        human beings.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Hrabowski recounted how, in his youth, he went to jail with 
        Dr. Martin Luther King. &quot;I learned the power of the individual to 
        change the world [and] the significance of education is that it's never 
        over,&quot; he said.<br>
        Sarah and James Bowdoin scholarships are awarded each fall on the basis 
        of work completed the previous academic year. The award is given to the 
        twenty percent of all eligible students with the highest grade point averages.<br>
        Book Awards are presented to every Sarah and James Bowdoin Scholar who 
        earned a GPA of 4.00. The Award bears a replica of the early College bookplate 
        serving to distinguish the James Bowdoin Collection in the library.</p>
      <p align="left">The Almon Goodwin Prize, presented to members of Phi Beta 
        Kappa chosen by vote of the Board of Trustees of the College, was bestowed 
        upon Matthew Harry Magenheim '03, Travis Adam Patten '03, and Monica Lynn 
        Skoge '03, all of whom also served as student marshals.</p>
      <p align="left">Other Phi Beta Kappa members from the Class of '03 are Elizabeth 
        Anne Barney, Erica Michelle Bellamy, Leah Dania Christensen, Angela Rose 
        Commito, Andrew Thomas Dunn, Liesl Finn, Maggie Ann Fritz-Morkin, and 
        Abbie Ann Klein.</p>
      <p align="left">The recognition of James Bowdoin Scholars was begun in 1941 
        to honor those undergraduates who distinguish themselves by excellence 
        in scholarship and to commemorate the Honorable James Bowdoin III (1752-1811), 
        first patron of the College. James Bowdoin III, who asked that the College 
        be named after his father, was an agriculturist, an art and book collector, 
        and a diplomat who served as Thomas Jefferson's minister plenipotentiary 
        to Spain from 1804 to 1808. </p>
      <p align="left">In 1997, by faculty vote, the commemorative day and distinction 
        as scholar were changed to recognize both Sarah and James Bowdoin, who 
        were married from 1780 until his 1811 death. Like her husband, Sarah Bowdoin 
        gave many gifts to the College, including most of the Bowdoin family portraits, 
        which were bequeathed to the College upon her death.</p>
