        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">National Parks and Wildlife Refuges are formed to serve 
        as areas of unspoiled nature where animals and plants can thrive without 
        negative human influence and where people can enjoy the unindustrialized 
        outdoors. If the government has set aside these pieces of nature for the 
        benefit of animals, plants, and humans alike, why does it now insist that 
        we interrupt these eco-systems for insignificant material benefit?</p>
      <p align="left">Currently, President Bush, whose policies to date have been 
        extremely anti-environment, wishes to drill on one of the only unspoiled 
        wildlife reserves left in the U.S. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 
        is home to a variety of animals that are endemic only to this fragile 
        tundra eco-system in Alaska. The vast coastal plain that constitutes the 
        refuge is home to musk oxen, wolves, and many other animals. Polar bears 
        travel to the refuge to make their maternity dens and 130 species of migratory 
        birds fly there to nest. The refuge also serves as a calving ground for 
        the 120,000 members of the Porcupine caribou herd. On the refuge, the 
        caribou birth their young, sustaining their population. These caribou 
        are an incredibly important resource for the Gwich'in Natives. This Alaskan 
        tribe has traditionally hunted caribou for thousands of years and depends 
        on the animals for their skins and meat. </p>
      <p align="left">If the Senate votes to allow drilling in the wildlife refuge, 
        it will open up the last 5% of Alaska's undeveloped coastal plain. Not 
        only will drilling in Alaska interrupt a fragile eco-system, it will not 
        even benefit Americans in terms of oil. Drilling in the refuge will yield 
        only 3.2 billion barrels of oil, which is equivalent to the amount of 
        oil the US consumes in six months. Drilling in the refuge will not provide 
        any kind of energy security, and industry analysts admit that if drilled, 
        the oil would not even be available for another ten years. So, despite 
        the fact that the U.S. government wishes to find sources of oil in the 
        U.S., the Arctic Refuge is not a reasonable or a useful alternative. </p>
      <p align="left">Although, the amendment to drill on the refuge was rejected 
        54-46 by the Senate in April 2002, the new 2003 Congress will debate this 
        bill once more. In hopes of publicizing the detrimental consequences of 
        drilling in the refuge and voicing their concern, thousands of Americans 
        have walked and biked across the country. The walk began in Seattle on 
        August 23, mostly with members of the Caribou Commons Project and the 
        Gwich'in Natives participating. Currently, these people are on the last 
        leg of their three month, eight thousand mile journey to Washington, D.C. 
        In the capital, the Seattle representatives will meet with groups that 
        have walked from Saratoga Springs, Kansas City and other towns and cities 
        to advocate the value of the Alaska Wildlife Refuge and to ask the Senate 
        to protect it. </p>
      <p align="left">In conjunction with the &quot;Walk to Washington,&quot; 
        this Friday, in Brunswick, the Bowdoin Evergreens as well as other Bowdoin 
        affiliated and community groups, will host a portion of the walk/bike. 
        The walk will meet in downtown Brunswick at the Fort Andross (the huge 
        brick building at the end of main street) at 4:30 p.m. and march up Main 
        Street. Everyone is encouraged to make signs and banners to hold during 
        the march. Following the march, at 7 p.m., Tim Leach, nature photographer, 
        adventurer, and Arctic advocate will speak and present a slide show in 
        the Beam Classroom in the Visual Arts Center. Tim's presentation is one 
        of the 40 that he will give throughout the Northeast on his 1,600 mile 
        bicycle trek. A member of the Gwich'in people will also speak to offer 
        a cultural viewpoint for the protection of the Arctic Refuge's coastal 
        plain. This presentation will promote more efficient energy solutions 
        that will allow us to control pollution, cut back on greenhouse gases, 
        and protect our environment.</p>
      <p align="left">The Bowdoin community as well as the greater public is strongly 
        encouraged to participate in this important march. It is a key opportunity 
        to voice our opposition to oil drilling in the ANWR, and the resulting 
        degradation of this delicate ecosystem. The movement to protect the Alaska 
        Wildlife Refuge is not, and should not, be fought only by the people and 
        groups that we assume will fight every environmental battle for us. In 
        the 2002 Senate vote, Republicans and Democrats united against oil drilling. 
        Whether you value the environment for its beauty or its peacefulness, 
        whether you camp and play in the outdoors, or whether you value nature 
        for the simple fact that it exists, the Alaska Wildlife Refuge is worth 
        preserving and worth fighting for. Even if you can't make the march, you 
        can still work towards creating a more sustainable and energy efficient 
        country by personally urging Congress to protect the Arctic Refuge by 
        calling the Capital Switchboard at 202-224-3121, and by writing your senators 
        and representatives (look up their addresses at <a href="http://www.house.gov">www.house.gov</a> 
        or <a href="http://www.senate.gov">www.senate.gov</a>). Your voice really 
        does make a difference, so exercise your right!</p>
