      <p align="left"><font size="5">Grading system still under scrutiny</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Last April when the Faculty voted to change Bowdoin's grading 
        system, many students objected. Six months later, dispute with the new 
        arrangement has increased. Only a month and a half into the school year, 
        a vocal campus has been voicing its concern over a transformation in academic 
        atmosphere. </p>
      <p align="left">The change from a five-point grading system to one with 
        pluses and minuses was supported by 61 percent of the Faculty in last 
        year's vote. Of the 70 voting professors, 45 were in favor while 29 dissented. 
        Many of those in favor backed the proposition only if it was passed by 
        a large margin; one professor attempted to initiate a new vote because 
        he did not feel the system should be changed by such a slight majority 
        in opinion.</p>
      <p align="left">Professors in favor of the adjustment stated in an April 
        5, 2001 Orient issue that it will add greater accuracy and distinction 
        among student work. One faculty member maintained that most students had 
        not known of the five-point system before coming to Bowdoin. It is incorrect 
        to assume this and would be difficult to believe that during the junior/senior 
        year of high school even a third of our student body overlooked this fact. 
        The decision to attend school here was made partially because of the less 
        stringent grading system and the academic tone this sets.</p>
      <p align="left">However, the main argument for the grading change is that 
        previously a distinction between an 89 and an 80 could not be made. Many 
        students gave just enough effort to hold onto a B rather than work harder 
        for the A. With the new system, extra effort will be rewarded by a better 
        grade. Yet it inevitably changes the atmosphere Bowdoin has been known 
        for.</p>
      <p align="left">An increase in attention to details and focus of specific 
        grades is beneficial to the work ethic of each individual. However, the 
        desire of 1600 students who expect close attention from professors can 
        easily cause conflict. Office hours have become increasingly hard to schedule 
        and will worsen as the number of papers and tests increase. Towards the 
        end of each semester each plus and minus will be accounted for, with students 
        lining up to get an extra.</p>
      <p align="left">The decision to change the grading system without waiting 
        for at least the Class of '03 to graduate is evidence of a self-interested 
        choice. While the Faculty does and should dictate all curriculum and teaching 
        frameworks, including major/minor requirements, the ability to alter a 
        student's experience even one year into Bowdoin is unwarranted. Will every 
        graduate have to explain the reasons he or she never received a plus prior 
        to the 2002-03 school term?</p>
      <p align="left">Professors voted for the plus-minus system because they 
        would like to accurately assess work and effort. Others value a comfortable 
        academic atmosphere more than the extra .3 on the GPA scale. Both should 
        consider a revision of the system in favor of a more democratic policy. 
        During the selection of majors/minors sophomore year, students should 
        also be given the freedom to decide how their transcript will appear. 
        The present system would be used throughout the four years at Bowdoin, 
        but the final record would show plus and minus at each individual's discretion. 
        This would not alter a professor's ability to evaluate students and could 
        alleviate what will become an ever-increasing concentration on GPA.</p>
