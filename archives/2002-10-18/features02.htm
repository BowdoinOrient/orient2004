        <font size="2">TIMOTHY J. RIEMER<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The markets in the past week have been volatile, to say 
        the least. We have seen the Dow go from its lowest mark in five years 
        to its largest percentage gain over four days-13 percent-since 1933 according 
        to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. The large four-day rally has many people 
        wondering if this is the beginning of a turn around for the markets and 
        the economy as a whole. Although the changes in market trends tend to 
        precede changes in the overall economy, certain economic factors indicate 
        that this past rally is not actually a turnaround in the economy.</p>
      <p align="left">If the economy were truly recovering then companies would 
        be expanding. However, in today's market we hear stories about how companies 
        cutting costs. Furthermore analysts would not be praising companies that 
        had good earnings because they were able to cut their costs. Earning reports 
        published by companies beat expectations not because of an unexpected 
        rise in business, but due to the companies' ability to cut costs among 
        waning business. For instance, IBM beat analysts' expectations for the 
        third quarter by maintaining current operations and cutting costs further. 
        The point here is that if the economy were truly recovering then companies 
        would be holding on, so to speak, but succeeding instead.</p>
      <p align="left">On Wednesday, to many people's dismay, the rally ended with 
        the Dow dropping 2.7 percent. However, what is even more daunting than 
        the woes in the market is overcapacity that still exists in today's economy. 
        According to the Wall Street Journal 41.7 percent of all United States 
        manufacturers are operating at less than 75 percent if their capacity. 
        What this implies, is that manufacturers do not have the business to operate 
        at full or near full capacity. This has the same implications as before. 
        The economy seems to be hanging on the edge of a cliff.</p>
      <p align="left">Another related problem currently plaguing the U.S. economy 
        is that capital investment (money spent on new equipment) was down five 
        percent last year and is expected to be down another five percent this 
        year. The lack of capital investment is obviously the result of overcapacity, 
        which in turn is the result of extreme capital investment during the late 
        90s. However, the more troubling news is that companies that actually 
        need to expand, despite the woes in the market, are purchasing used equipment 
        instead of investing in new equipment in attempts to cut costs. Other 
        companies, instead of building new plants, are simply revamping their 
        current plants. Although this does solve problems of overcapacity, which 
        is good, it also takes away from capital investment.</p>
      <p align="left">The aspect about these economic factors that bothers me 
        is not that the factors imply that markets will not change, but that the 
        economy most likely has not seen the worst yet. If companies are hanging 
        on, then how long can they hold on for before letting go? Many firms are 
        hoping for a turnaround in the market in the final quarter since the fourth 
        quarter is usually filled with better economic times due to the holiday 
        season and other seasonal trends. If the economy does not improve in the 
        fourth quarter then this could be disastrous for many companies who are 
        holding on by a thin string. </p>
      <p align="left">Furthermore, the economy tends to slump in January due to 
        its own seasonal trends. In my opinion, it seems like it is a now or never 
        situation for the economy. Either the economy starts to pick up now, or 
        it is going to get a whole lot worse in the next couple of months as the 
        thin string many companies are holding on to breaks.</p>
