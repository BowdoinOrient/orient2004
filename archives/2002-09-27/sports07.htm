        <font size="2">J.P. BOX</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Remember when the United States Men's Basketball Team could 
        beat Spain left-handed? Or how about when the U.S. Men's Soccer Team couldn't 
        run with a J.V. team from a Brazilian high school? </p>
      <p>Those were the good old days when no one really cared about a sport in 
        which you couldn't use your hands unless you had special gloves. Instead, 
        we turned all of our attention to basketball, a game that demands its 
        players to use their hands in harmonious motions of absolute dexterity.</p>
      <p>But then the unthinkable happened-U.S. Soccer earned international respect 
        after outplaying a stacked German team led by the world's stingiest goalie, 
        Oliver Kahn, in the quarterfinals of the World Cup 2002. Although the 
        men in blue lost by a score of one to nil and failed to advance to the 
        semifinals, they asserted themselves as legitimate contenders in the international 
        arena.</p>
      <p>Landon Donovan, Clint Mathis, and Eddie Lewis may not be household names 
        in the U.S., but you better bet that the average Brazilian, Spaniard, 
        or Brit knows about them after their inspirational performances in the 
        World Cup.</p>
      <p>In the most important sporting competition on the planet, the United 
        States finally shrugged the title of perennial losers. Suddenly, it was 
        cool to like soccer, and we woke up at ungodly hours to watch the games 
        live. </p>
      <p>Sure, we didn't have the slightest clue what was going on, but we knew 
        that it was important. Sports history was unfolding and we were going 
        to be there for every second of it-including that strangely arbitrary 
        system of bonus time in which the referee lets the athletes play a little 
        longer until finally blowing the whistle several minutes after the official 
        time has elapsed.</p>
      <p>And yes, we didn't understand why a soccer player would be carted off 
        on a stretcher after tripping over a dandelion, but we cheered when he 
        ran back onto the field five minutes later.</p>
      <p>And of course none of us knew why Ronaldo forgot to shave the front part 
        of his scalp, but that didn't matter-we were Cup-crazy and rooting for 
        the biggest upset in the history of world sports.</p>
      <p>In short, things were looking up for American athletics. In addition 
        to soccer's strong showing, the U.S. would surely claim another basketball 
        title in the upcoming World Championships.<br>
        But then the even more unthinkable happened-the U.S. Men's Basketball 
        Team, considered to be the most dominating collection of ballers in the 
        world, placed sixth. Kobe Bryant, Shaq, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Kidd 
        did not compete, but their absence cannot explain the unprecedented flop.</p>
      <p> Five other countries fielded better teams than the United States in 
        2002, including Argentina, Spain, and champion Yugoslavia.<br>
        After an 81-75 victory over the United States, Spanish coach Javier Imbroda 
        said, &quot;This is a good experience (for the Americans) to establish 
        what happens when you lose, and to analyze it, because the world is changing.''</p>
      <p>A couple of months ago that comment would have seemed smug, arrogant, 
        and laughable. Today, Americans must accept the reality of an embarrassing 
        finish that included three losses in the final four games of international 
        competition.</p>
      <p>Just months after the U.S. Soccer played with a passion that their opponents 
        failed to match, the U.S. Basketball Team tentatively took part in the 
        international competition. Said NBA rookie-of-the-year Pau Gasol of Spain: 
        &quot;I think they play harder in the NBA than they did here. These were 
        not the players I know.&quot;</p>
      <p>George Karl, head coach of the American Reamed Team, was not willing 
        to concede a lack of effort, but rather attributed the stunning losses 
        to better training techniques and coaching abroad that focuses more on 
        the game's fundamentals.</p>
      <p>While players, coaches, and analysts disagree about the reasons for Collapse 
        2002, it is undisputable that the Americans simply could not hang with 
        the Europeans or the Latin Americans in 2002.</p>
      <p>However, there is a positive to be drawn from the demise of the ballers 
        and the rise of the kickers: America finally made good on its promise 
        of equality. Our soccer team and basketball team fare about the same in 
        world competition.</p>
      <p>The future must be bright.</p>
