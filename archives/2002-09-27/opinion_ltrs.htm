      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bowdoin alumnus faces prejudice</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I read with sadness, but not surprise, your recent article on several 
        incoming first-year international students facing problems entering this 
        country due to new restrictions (&quot;Foreign first-years face U.S. visa 
        obstacles,&quot; September 20). It is not only current Bowdoin students 
        who have been affected by the rule changes, but alumni as well.</p>
      <p>Naeem Ahmed '00 worked in New York City after graduating from Bowdoin. 
        He was there the day of September 11, though fortunately not in the vicinity 
        of the World Trade Center. He was interviewed shortly thereafter by the 
        FBI, who wanted to know if he, as a Pakistani national, had had any involvement 
        with the terrorists. He willingly answered their questions, and assumed 
        his name had been cleared. He applied and was accepted to begin graduate 
        studies at Columbia University in the fall.</p>
      <p>In March of this year he traveled to London for a new visa, but had to 
        wait two months while the FBI conducted another security check on him, 
        after which he returned to the U.S.. In early August, he received a letter 
        from the State Department telling him the visa was being revoked due to 
        security concerns. His employer then fired him, and he had to return to 
        Pakistan or face deportation.</p>
      <p>Anyone who knows Naeem will not be surprised to know that he has refused 
        to become embittered over this. He is currently trying to apply for a 
        new visa and return to this country, but is not putting his life on hold 
        in the meantime. He is getting married in December to a high school classmate 
        of his, a Princeton alumna who is also working in New York City. While 
        in Lahore, he is applying for research assistantships at local colleges, 
        and perhaps securing a part-time position in electronic banking at one 
        of the local financial institutions.</p>
      <p>Naeem delivered the Goodwin Commencement address at the graduation ceremonies 
        in May of 2000 entitled &quot;The Debt of our Degrees.&quot; He spoke 
        on stereotyping based on origin and religion, and how we must not lie 
        still when there is injustice around us. &quot;We must use out experience 
        and sharpened intellects to affect changes for a world where there is 
        greater tolerance, sharing, and understanding, and less bigotry, prejudice, 
        and violence,&quot; he said in his speech. In light of cases like Naeem's, 
        this year's international first-year students', and similar happenings 
        throughout the country, his words have taken on a new meaning. I, for 
        one, am not lying still, and am doing my best to support Naeem in his 
        efforts to return to this country and face down prejudice as he has since 
        the day he entered Brunswick. The debt of my degree calls for no less.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Kim Schneider '00<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Where oh where is Ludwig Rang?</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>But where, where, where is Ludwig Rang? To remind infrequent readers, 
        in the final Orient of last year, Rang signed off with a compelling, blood-quickening 
        account of his fathering a love-child, followed by the renunciation of 
        the dilettante homosexuality he had been engaged in. With an inscrutable 
        flourish, he hinted at the possibility of compiling his experiences in 
        a book, but gave little hint that he would be retreating from the public 
        forum that is the Orient. After all, we had just heard about the end of 
        the 1960s, and Bowdoin's own Zelig would be sure to be at the heart of 
        the social and political issues that wracked the 1970s. Where was he for 
        Watergate? The energy crisis? Television's Marquee Moon?</p>
      <p>In short, once engaged in the public compact, Ludwig Rang cannot withdraw; 
        he must continue. Mr. Rang, sir, your admirers await your next installment.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Willing Davidson '99</p>
