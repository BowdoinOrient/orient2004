        <font size="2">KATHERINE CRANE</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> We've decided we don't like Germany any more. In fact, 
        we're so mad at those Germans we're not even going to talk to them, and 
        neither are any of our friends. You won't see them sitting at our lunch 
        table, and it goes without saying we're going to cross them right off 
        our list of best buds. <br>
        You see, the German Justice Minister said something that really hurt our 
        feelings, and we don't take kindly to having our feelings hurt. She said 
        that we just wanted to go to war to divert attention from the economy, 
        and that Hitler did the exact same thing. </p>
      <p align="left">Now, if you're going to be nitpicky about it (and just so 
        you know, we really hate nitpickers), maybe she was right. The economy 
        isn't doing too great, and people aren't too happy about that, but we 
        really wish they'd quit blaming us.</p>
      <p align="left">Everything was so much easier last year. Almost everybody 
        liked us, and the people who didn't like us were our enemies, and we knew 
        who they were. The world was on our side, and we could do anything we 
        wanted.</p>
      <p align="left">We could drop bombs on Afghanistan, and we did, and that 
        was a lot of fun, but it was over too soon and we got bored. Then we looked 
        around one day and realized that we weren't as popular as we used to be. 
        We could do things wrong again, and that really scared us.</p>
      <p align="left">So we came up with this idea, which we thought was good, 
        and we were pretty darn proud of it until the Germans had to come along 
        and be rude: we decided to start another war against Iraq. We figured 
        everybody already hated Saddam Hussein, so attacking him would be an easy 
        way to make people like us. And just like in Afghanistan, we could have 
        fun dropping bombs, and get points for fighting terrorism at the same 
        time.</p>
      <p align="left">True, Saddam hadn't actually done anything to us, but we 
        figured out a way around that little problem. We knew Saddam really, really 
        didn't want to let in weapons inspectors, so we told him he had to or 
        we were going to start a war. Only Saddam, being the world's biggest spoilsport, 
        decided to agree unconditionally to what we asked for.</p>
      <p align="left">That really made us mad. If you ask us, the only thing more 
        annoying than having friends who don't agree with you is having enemies 
        who do.<br>
        So naturally, with Saddam being so darn unhelpful, all we could do was 
        increase our demands, and sure enough, that worked. So right now, we feel 
        pretty proud of ourselves, and if anybody tries to say that Hitler did 
        the same thing in Czechoslovakia, we're just going to stick our fingers 
        in our ears and hum loudly until they go away.</p>
      <p align="left">That's what we've been doing whenever Germany comes around 
        trying to apologize. They're probably feeling pretty alone and unpopular 
        right now. Not that we care. After all, how do they think it felt to be 
        publicly criticized by one of our best friends? When we heard that Germany 
        was still against us going to war, we decided right then and there that 
        we were never ever going to be friends with Germany again, no matter how 
        much they begged.<br>
        Just to rub it in, we didn't call the Gerhard Schr&ouml;der like we were 
        supposed to when he got reelected. He probably sat by the phone that whole 
        evening, waiting for us to call. He should have known you don't criticize 
        our judgment and get away with it.</p>
      <p align="left">After all, it's not easy being popular. You have to know 
        who your friends are.</p>
