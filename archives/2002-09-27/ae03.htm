        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> On Thursday September 19th of last week, Bowdoin students 
        had the privilege of having a very talented rock band come as entertainment 
        for senior pub night: Liquid Dead. As their name implies, the band is 
        a group that tours New England covering dozens of songs by the Grateful 
        Dead. Being a first-year and a huge deadhead myself, I was very excited 
        and eager to hear the band, and find out what kind of hippie population 
        existed at Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">The band opened a little after ten o'clock with the song, 
        &quot;Here Comes Sunshine,&quot; a classic concert opener. The crowd started 
        off with an average of seven people, and by eleven-thirty, the place was 
        so jammed that people were dancing outside of the pub as well. The crowd 
        tried to request songs, especially Truckin', the Dead's popular hit that 
        includes the famous line, &quot;What a long strange trip it's been&#133;&quot;. 
        However, the band had a play list already selected, and quite a great 
        one at that. Their sets included renowned classics such as, &quot;I know 
        you rider&quot;, &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot; and &quot;Beat it on 
        down the line&quot;. Most of the songs that were chosen were actually 
        very often selected by the Grateful Dead during their own live concerts. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The thing that made the concert so great was that not only 
        were they playing the songs of one of the greatest rock bands in history, 
        but they were very authentic and effective in imitating and projecting 
        what the real band sounded like. Like the Grateful Dead, this band took 
        exceptional liberties with their solos. Like Jerry Garcia, the lead guitarist 
        of Liquid Dead, Toby Kniffin, played with a very authentic sound, and 
        let his solos continue until he was finished leaving a lasting impression 
        on the audience. Other members of the band include Larry, on rhythm guitar; 
        Eric on Bass; Brian on Keyboards; Trevor and Kniff on drums, and 'Little 
        Bri' on sound. Like the Grateful Dead, this band had two powerful drummers, 
        and someone who managed the band's sound and acoustics. The band is originally 
        from Burlington, Vermont, but they spend most of their time trucking around 
        New England for concerts. Their fall tour includes destinations in Pittsfield, 
        Massachusetts, Jeffersonville, Vermont, New York City and New London, 
        Connecticut. For a full list of their tour dates, set lists and general 
        information about the band, check out their website: <a href="http://www.liquiddead.com">www.liquiddead.com</a>. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">From the look of things, the seniors and other Bowdoin students 
        who attended the concert had a great time. The band had someone constantly 
        promoting them, and instituting a game of limbo in order to win Liquid 
        Dead T-shirts, hats and bottle openers. Needless to say, everyone walked 
        home with something that night, and we're very lucky to have an activities 
        committee that can bring such talented shows to our campus. For the more 
        hardcore Dead fans, it is great to know that bands that can be considered 
        historical cornerstones in the history of music like the Grateful Dead 
        will never die, but live on through the reverent music of bands like Liquid 
        Dead. </p>
