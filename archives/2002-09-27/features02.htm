      <p align="left"><font size="5">Midpoint of History<br>
        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">They believed it to be the mid-point of all history. From 
        that moment they could look back five thousand years and see the first 
        historical record - the chronicle of mankind's journey towards an unknown 
        destiny. They believed themselves to be fortunate not only because of 
        medicines that could only have been dreamed of decades earlier but also 
        because of new technologies, which would have made the most brilliant 
        scientist of the previous era gasp in awe. Before them stood an era of 
        optimism, or so they believed - desperate people who have seen the rough 
        life are willing to stake anything on the uncertainty of a better world. 
        If they looked back upon their own lives they could very well see a generation 
        that had weathered the Great War - that nightmare world of strange foxholes 
        and endless trenches where death and chaos ruled the muddy, gas-filled 
        battlefields of western Europe. A generation of men had gone to war with 
        each other and the machine that had long been kept deep inside the mind 
        of man's ingenious scientists was finally let loose to show the world 
        the might of the engine, of the machine gun, of the tank, of the airplane.</p>
      <p align="left">That time of trial and trouble had swiftly passed and the 
        millions of bodies still stank the globe in a filth that, strangely enough, 
        could be washed away only with more blood. But the stench was suppressed 
        beneath the burgeoning communities and the grand ideals. The generation 
        that had watched the dawn of the twentieth century, praying that it would 
        not be another war-torn one, the generation that had to first face the 
        horrors of modern battle continued to push forward, blocking away the 
        memories, training their eyes on a peace that could eventually never be 
        kept.</p>
      <p align="left">In 1928, Herbert Hoover proclaimed of the new decade about 
        to dawn, &quot;Given a chance to go forward with the policies of the last 
        eight years and we shall soon, with the help of God, be in sight of the 
        day when poverty will be banished from this nation.&quot; It was an optimistic 
        statement, which as history has shown, was based on a house of lies. In 
        this same speech, Hoover announced that &quot;our exports&#133;are 58 
        per cent greater than before the war. Constructive leadership and cooperation 
        by the Government have released and stimulated the energies of our people. 
        Faith in the future has been restored. Confidence in our form of government 
        has never been greater.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The thirties saw the advent of social security and unemployment 
        insurance, hospitalization plans, the first cyclotron, sulfa drugs and 
        the artificial lung, insulin-shock therapy, television, the five-day week 
        and frozen foods. In the 1930s a nickel could buy a candy bar, a cup of 
        coffee, or a magazine; a nickel could get you a subway pass, or give you 
        a go at the slot machine. John Steinbeck, the highly acclaimed author 
        wrote of the era:</p>
      <blockquote>Sure I remembered the Nineteen Thirties, the terrible, troubled, 
        triumphant, surging Thirties. I can't think of any decade in history when 
        so much happened in so many directions. Violent changes took place. Our 
        country was modeled, our lives remolded, our government rebuilt, forced 
        to functions, duties and responsibilities it never had before and can 
        never relinquish.</blockquote>
      <p>The &quot;violent changes&quot; which Steinbeck mentioned came as a result 
        of none other than the stock market crash in 1929. Wrote Dixon Wecter:</p>
      <blockquote>Upon this world of uneasy prosperity the first blow fell in late October. 
        Like the sound of a gunshot which starts an Alpine avalanche, a minor 
        panic on the New York Stock Exchange began on the twenty-third among stocks 
        that speculators had pushed to fantastic heights. The next day, &quot;Black 
        Thursday,&quot; saw hysteria rampant. Brokers wept and tore off their 
        collars trying to keep abreast selling orders; sight-seers jammed the 
        Wall Street district, ogled the arrival of great bankers in their limousines 
        before the House of Morgan, and under the rumor of mass suicide gathered 
        to watch an ordinary workman on a scaffolding in morbid expectation of 
        his plunge.</blockquote>
      <p>In the months that followed financial difficulties ravaged the nation. 
        Gallows humor - like the one where a room clerk asks guests, &quot;For 
        sleeping or jumping?&quot; - attempted to lighten spirits. John Steinbeck 
        remembered the hard times, recounting the story of how he was forced to 
        wash his laundry with soap made from pork fat, wool ashes, and salt. &quot;It 
        worked&quot; he remembered, &quot;but it took a lot of sunning to get 
        the smell out of the sheets.&quot; Hard hit were the factory towns of 
        New England. A touring writer, Louis Adamic recorded his findings:</p>
      <blockquote>In Lowell [Massachusetts] I saw shabby men leaning against walls and 
        lamp-posts, and standing on street corners singly or in twos or threes; 
        pathetic, silent, middle-aged men in torn, frayed overcoats or even without 
        overcoats, broken shoes on their feet (in a town manufacturing shoes!), 
        slumped in postures of hopeless discontent, their faces sunken and their 
        eyes shifty and bewildered - men who winced and jerked queerly when they 
        noticed me looking at them, and shuffled off uncertainly, wringing their 
        hands in a mingling of vague desperation and or resentment at my gaze.</blockquote>
      <p>In the town of Lawrence, Adamic found a similar situation:</p>
      <blockquote>Men stood on curbs, wretchedness inherent in their every action and aspect; 
        penniless men, most of them without any intelligent, objective idea of 
        what was happening to them, what was going on in Lawrence or in the textile 
        industry. One of them said to me, &quot;I don't know nothing, only that 
        I have no job. No job - no job,&quot; he repeated in a shrill, half-hysterical 
        voice.</blockquote>
