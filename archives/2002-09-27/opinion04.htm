        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> This year's convocation was the first time in many years 
        that the ceremony was not held in a church. President Mills discussed 
        why he moved the service out of First Parish Church in the most recent 
        issue of The Patriot. He said: &quot;there are a significant number of 
        people who&#133;feel uncomfortable attending Convocation in a church.&quot; 
        I believe that this College should respect people's religious sensitivities. 
        However, to remove both Convocation and potentially Baccalaureate ceremonies 
        from First Parish Church disrespects Bowdoin's long-standing relationship 
        with the church and religion in general. </p>
      <p align="left">This weekend I read parts of Prof. Ernst Helmreich's book 
        Religion at Bowdoin College. He wrote this short work in 1981, after he 
        had retired from his post as a professor of history. The book explains 
        Bowdoin's storied, yet often ambiguous and confused relationship with 
        religion. </p>
      <p align="left">Contrary to popular belief, Bowdoin was not founded as a 
        &quot;Congregational School.&quot; Rather it was eight Congregational 
        ministers who first successfully petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts 
        to charter Bowdoin. Unlike many colleges in those days, the school's first 
        charter lacked any reference to educating ministers or preaching the gospel 
        as a goal of the new college. <br>
        However, all of Bowdoin's early presidents were Congregational ministers. 
        Therefore it is no surprise that President McKeen's inaugural address 
        in 1802 defined the role that religion would play in Bowdoin's early years: 
        &quot;The governors and instructors of a literary institution owe to God 
        and society the sacred duty of guarding the morals of the youth committed 
        to their care.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin, as was the collegiate custom in those days, believed 
        that morality and religion were inextricably tied. Their policies manifested 
        the words of eighteenth century Yale president Timothy Dwight, who wrote, 
        &quot;Where God is not worshipped, his character will soon be disregarded; 
        and the obligation founded on it, unfelt, and forgotten.&quot; Students 
        in Bowdoin President Appleton's day (1807-1819) were forbidden from drinking, 
        playing cards, smoking cigars, or associating with &quot;any person of 
        known dissolute morals.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">These historical facts may seem trivial as we discuss the 
        location of important school ceremonies. I discuss these stories to show 
        critics of holding Baccalaureate and Convocation in First Parish why they 
        should not be offended by the location. Religion in Bowdoin ceremonies 
        sanctifies good behavior and does not mandate Christian worship. Today 
        we still have inviolable principles that deserve ceremonial veneration. 
        Bowdoin of 2002 concerns itself more with plagiarism and intolerance than 
        playing cards and &quot;dissolute morals.&quot; But we are remiss if we 
        think that the Bowdoin of 1802 shares nothing with Bowdoin of 2002. </p>
      <p align="left">Our social and academic and honor code would have some resonance 
        with Bowdoin's early presidents. To use language from the early days, 
        it is still illegal on campus for one to be &quot;challenging, assaulting, 
        or fighting with any person.&quot; Today we get in trouble with our proctor/RA 
        if we &quot;cause a disturbance&#133;by playing an instrument, or making 
        any noise or tumult&quot; instead of being fined twenty cents. </p>
      <p align="left">Even though our Social and Honor Code explicitly states 
        that it &quot;imposes no specific morality on students,&quot; it is a 
        product of an implicit Judeo-Christian morality. We could cover all incidents 
        of potential code violations if we substituted the current language with 
        &quot;Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not lie,&quot; and &quot;do unto 
        your neighbor as you would have done to you.&quot; Perhaps it would be 
        more accurate to say that our social and honor code imposes no &quot;theology&quot; 
        instead of &quot;morality.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Holding school ceremonies at First Parish Church also does 
        not impose a theology. Rather it reminds us of our school's history-of 
        those who have come before us, signed the book, sat in the pews, walked 
        the quad, etc. We are placed in a context that transcends our own time 
        here at Bowdoin. <br>
        Holding Convocation and Baccalaureate in a church that has been an historical 
        friend to the college for 200 years is important because it can uphold 
        modern &quot;virtue and piety&quot;. Though today we understand those 
        words more liberally than our forefathers did two hundred years ago, a 
        solemn ceremony can reinforce a similar idea. </p>
      <p align="left">Our predecessors believed that God's law and school law 
        were conjoined. Today we should hold our important ceremonies in buildings 
        laden with tradition to remind us that violating our standards insults 
        not only ourselves but also the thousands of men and women whose lives 
        Bowdoin has affected. First Parish Church is a historical and appropriate 
        location for solemn ceremonies and it would be an insult to our history 
        to change that tradition. </p>
