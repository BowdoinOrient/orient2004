      <p>This weekend 200-300 alumni will return to Bowdoin for a weekend of workshops, 
        meetings and presentation of awards. The Fall Volunteer Conference of 
        the Alumni Fund, Alumni Council and BASIC Volunteers is being held from 
        Thursday to Saturday his week.</p>
      <p>&quot;[There is] common thread for all in attendance. They care deeply 
        about Bowdoin College and invest incredible amounts of time and energy 
        to make Bowdoin a special place,&quot; said Alumni Relations Director 
        Kevin Wesley.</p>
      <p>The Alumni Council, made up of 32 alumni of all ages from around the 
        country, consists of 12 committees who oversee a variety of events and 
        programs, including Alumni Education, Volunteer Engagement, Career Services 
        and Multicultural Alumni Involvement. The Council will be looking at ways 
        to effectively let more class volunteers &quot;help in a meaningful way,&quot; 
        according to Wesley. </p>
      <p>Currently, there are so many people wanting to become actively involved 
        in the Bowdoin community that there just aren't enough jobs for them to 
        do. &quot;[It's] a great problem to have,&quot; said Wesley. <br>
        They will also be looking for ways to keep students connected after they 
        graduate and to get more people actively involved in planning and fundraising 
        efforts.</p>
      <p>Newer issues, such as the fact that alums are more spread out, have come 
        up in the last few years and need to be addressed as well. Demographics 
        have shifted, pressures on time are greater today than in the past, yet 
        the Alumni Office's goal is to have Bowdoin graduates maintain the same 
        level of involvement in the college. They hope to achieve this through 
        programs such as alumni travel with CBB professors and the alumni college 
        program, which brings 50 alumni back to campus in the summer to study 
        a specific topic with Bowdoin professors.</p>
      <p>Committee heads of the BASIC (Bowdoin Alumni Schools Interviews Communications) 
        National Advisory Board will also meet for workshops this weekend. The 
        workshops will focus on leadership, fundraising strategies and clarification 
        of goals. According to Wesley, BASIC volunteers are the &quot;extended 
        arms of the admissions office&quot; who conduct interviews with prospective 
        students and host college fairs in various cities all over the country.</p>
      <p>The Alumni Fund Directors are also meeting to discuss the annual alumni 
        giving and to work on reaching participation goals. Bowdoin has &quot;some 
        of the most dedicated alumni in the country, with the rate of giving at 
        57%,&quot; said Wesley, with nearly six out of ten alumni donating money 
        to the Alumni Fund each year. </p>
      <p>The fund raises over six million dollars each year, which then go into 
        the general operating budget of the college and helps pay for expenses 
        such as facilities, maintenance, salaries and financial aid. </p>
