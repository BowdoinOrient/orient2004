      <p>A grant to English professor Patricia Saunders will bring a taste of 
        Caribbean culture to campus this year. </p>

      <p>Saunders, now in her fourth year at Bowdoin, has been awarded the first 
        &quot;Emerging Voices, New Directions&quot; grant from the Ford Foundation. 
        According to Saunders, her proposal Swimming Against the Tides: Caribbean 
        Culture and Market Values in the Age of Globalization &quot;incorporates 
        a multidisciplinary approach to exploring Caribbean culture and globalization.&quot; 
        The grant is offered to &quot;individuals, organizations, and projects 
        that work to maintain, interrupt, and transform relations of power in 
        a global society.&quot;</p>
      <p>The $42,000 grant will allow Saunders to &quot;build an active reader&quot; 
        for her courses Caribbean Popular Culture: Narrative, Nationalism, and 
        Identity (Africana Studies / English 287) and Literature, Culture, and 
        Value in the Age of Globalization (English 336), both being taught for 
        the first time this year with the first in the fall and the second in 
        the spring. The classes will bring speakers from several different disciplines 
        to campus. The grant also provides for four fellowships, three for students 
        and one for a faculty member, for summer study in the Caribbean. </p>
      <p>&quot;The idea behind the grant is to expose Bowdoin students and faculty 
        to the vast array of research and scholarship in Caribbean Studies being 
        done abroad and in the United States as well,&quot; said Saunders. </p>
      <p>Speakers will typically spend three or four days at Bowdoin, giving lectures, 
        workshops, and independent study meetings. All events will be open to 
        the public. Saunders hopes to reach beyond the Bowdoin community by holding 
        some events in Portland. </p>
      <p>The first lecture will be held on October 8 at 7 p.m. in Searles 315 
        with a reception to follow. Filmmaker Robert Yao Ramesar from the University 
        of the West Indies campus in St. Augustine, Trinidad will deliver a talk 
        called &quot;Carib/being&quot; and Shalini Puri from the University of 
        Pittsburgh's Department of English will speak on &quot;Indo-Caribbeans: 
        Negotiating National Identities.&quot;</p>
      <p>Other parts of the grant will include a reading group involving faculty 
        in several disciplines from Bowdoin as well as Bates, Colby, Boston College, 
        Harvard, and the University of Southern Maine; as well as curriculum development 
        through meetings between faculty from Bowdoin and the University of the 
        West Indies. Saunders spent last year on leave on a Porter Fellowship 
        as a Visiting Professor in the Department of Liberal Arts at U.W.I. in 
        St. Augustine.</p>
      <p>The students in the 300-level class next spring will create presentations 
        for public workshops on &quot;a cultural practice, institution, or symbol 
        from Caribbean or Caribbean-American culture&quot; of their choice, and 
        the value of these cultural symbols in the globalization era. </p>
      <p>&quot;The idea is that students will be able to share with their peers 
        some of the extensive and complicated negotiations taking place beneath 
        the surface of seemingly accepted notions of &quot;belonging,&quot; &quot;citizenship,&quot; 
        &quot;community&quot; - all terms and ideas which are pushed to their 
        limits as part of processes of globalization,&quot; said Saunders.</p>
      <p>Saunders' first book, Disciplining Discourses, Translating Identities: 
        Caribbean Literature and the &quot;Quarrel with (H)istory,&quot; concerning 
        literature, nationalism, and gender in the English-speaking Caribbean, 
        evolved from her dissertation. Her second book project is on Jamaican 
        popular culture, specifically dancehall music and culture. </p>
      <p>&quot;In this book I am interested in examining the extent to which globalization 
        - and its attendant migrations, trends, ruptures, and collisions - are 
        represented in Jamaican music,&quot; said Saunders. &quot;One of the things 
        I am most interested in is how economic policies (such as structural adjustment) 
        are appropriated and transformed in cultural dialogues between the state 
        and its citizens.&quot;</p>
      <p>The book's topics are echoed in Caribbean Popular Culture. &quot;We talk 
        a lot about the way migration and the movement of ideas, values, and identities 
        across national and international boundaries necessitates new critical 
        perspectives capable of identifying emerging modes of cultural expression.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I'm interested in learning about a culture that's very different 
        from my own,&quot; said Brandon Kaplan '05, a student in Caribbean Popular 
        Culture. Kaplan cited &quot;the levels of diversity of culture the class 
        confronts in focusing on one small area of the globe,&quot; as one of 
        the most interesting things about the class, &quot;because of the nature 
        of the area we're studying.&quot; </p>
