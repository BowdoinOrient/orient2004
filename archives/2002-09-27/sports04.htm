      <p align="left">Neither the unseasonable heat nor a string of unfortunate 
        injuries could stop </p>
      <p align="left">the Men's Rugby team from prevailing at home last Saturday. 
        In the season's first match, the Bowdoin ruggers easily beat Plymouth 
        State College 62-0, and picked up where they left off in last year's undefeated 
        regular season.</p>
      <p align="left">The Polar Bear ruggers proved that they could win in their 
        September 14th scrimmage against Bates, but last Saturday they stepped 
        up their game a notch and grabbed the first victory of the fall.</p>
      <p align="left">Leading the backs with his usual poise and ruthless play, 
        senior captain Dennis Kiley cut through the opposition and left Plymouth 
        State scratching their heads. Although Kiley spent this past semester 
        in Ireland, he returned to Bowdoin as quick and as strong as ever, and 
        with even more sheen to his flowing hair. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Bowdoin = good, season outlook = optimistic&quot; 
        said the always loquacious Kiley after the match. &quot;Hard work = needed, 
        but team = strong.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Kiley was not the only one who made contributions in the 
        back line. Sophomore scrum half Tom Hazel showed maturity beyond his years 
        on the pitch, and has proven his ability to fill the shoes left by Matt 
        Stanton '02. </p>
      <p align="left">Although he only has one year of experience under his belt, 
        Hazel played hard and pulled the ball out of the rucks until he was red 
        in the face. <br>
        &quot;Playing scrum half is difficult at first,&quot; noted Hazel, &quot;but 
        after a while it becomes very intuitive. It's like putting on sunscreen-you 
        just get used to doing it.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">As usual, the forwards played well and did an admirable 
        job rucking the ball and getting it to the back line. Led by senior captain 
        Dave Kirkland, the forwards hit hard from the first minute of the match 
        and did not let up on Plymouth State until the last whistle blew. <br>
        Sadly, the pack has been plagued by injuries of late, and Saturday's match 
        was no exception. Starting prop Joe Wilson (class undetermined) was already 
        sidelined due to injuries, and within the first ten minutes of the game, 
        Kirkland suffered a concussion and had to be taken off the field. Not 
        soon after that, Larry Jackson '05 was taken out of the game due to ankle 
        problems. </p>
      <p align="left">It was not only injuries that affected the Bowdoin forwards. 
        Reserve flanker Alex Meszaros '05 was unable to play and was absent from 
        the pitch. Meszaros, known for his speed and his tackling ability, could 
        not be in Brunswick on Saturday, as some of his rugby equipment was in 
        a jar on a shelf in the Penn dorms. </p>
      <p align="left">Despite all of the setbacks, the forwards carried the day, 
        and Bowdoin rugby showed its depth as a team, with all of the starting 
        and reserve forwards filling in wherever they were needed. The most notable 
        performance in the pack was turned in by The Goat '03, filling in at prop 
        for Wilson. </p>
      <p align="left">The Goat, who had never played prop before in his three 
        years as a Bowdoin rugger, handled both the rough play of the Plymouth 
        State forwards as well as the constant whining and moaning of his tight-head 
        prop. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Losing Dave [Kirkland] was very hard on the team,&quot; 
        said Coach Rick Scala, &quot;but the fact that Bowdoin went on without 
        him and still pulled out a victory is a testament to his leadership. We 
        played without a lot of key guys and we still looked like the best team 
        in New England out there.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Injured wing Alexis &quot;Focus&quot; Acevedo '04 could 
        not participate in the match Saturday, but was nevertheless very metaphorical 
        about Saturday's victory. &quot;Rugby is kind of like two crabs fighting 
        in a glass tank,&quot; he said, &quot;in the end, one crab-or in this 
        case, one team-is going to win.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">After the victory over Plymouth State, Bowdoin scrimmaged 
        with Maine Maritime Academy, and all of Bowdoin's rookies got a chance 
        to gain valuable playing experience. As an added bonus, the Bowdoin rookies 
        were helped by some alumni participation, as Billy Soares '02, Kris Bosse 
        '02, and Rob Mandle '02 were all in attendance and played in the scrimmage.<br>
        &quot;It was really fun to come back and see so many new faces,&quot; 
        mused Bosse. &quot;I learned a lot from my experiences on the Bowdoin 
        rugby team. I took a lot of things in my four years here, and hopefully 
        the rookies will take some of the same things I did before they leave 
        the Bowdoin campus.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The Bowdoin ruggers are as excited as ever about tomorrow's 
        match at the University of Maine at Farmington. With one victory already 
        under their belts, they hope to continue their winning ways and live up 
        to the high standard set by last year's squad. GO BLACK!</p>
