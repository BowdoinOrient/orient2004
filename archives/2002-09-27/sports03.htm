      <p align="left">JV Soccer - nope it's definitely not played for the glory. 
        In a world dominated by male sports where you can't find any channel broadcasting 
        a women's event if you tried all day, the men's JV team has ceased to 
        exist and the women's team is sporting almost 40 members. </p>
      <p>Proud three-year member Jenny Harvey exclaimed, &quot;When I arrived 
        as a freshman, JV was just starting to get going. Now it has doubled in 
        size and is a sport that is popular throughout all grades.&quot;</p>
      <p>It truly is a season that is played from game to game-all five of them. 
        JV soccer fills a specific niche in the Bowdoin College landscape. Maybe 
        you go to practice three times a week or maybe you can't make it to the 
        game until twenty minutes into it. But the deal is, when you're there, 
        you're there. </p>
      <p>It's your time to play - you don't bicker about playing time and you're 
        not depressed because you were off that day. Harvey claimed, &quot;JV 
        soccer is one of the best things that ever happened to me. It's soccer 
        the way it should be, just for fun, with no pressure or huge time commitment.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>It's not that the team lacks competitive spirit, but that it's played 
        at its purest on the field where friendship prevails above all. You go 
        to JV for a smile, a rush, or to pick you up, but it's never a chore. 
      </p>
      <p>An anonymous source raved, &quot;When I first came to Bowdoin, I was 
        not sure of what to expect. Then I began JV soccer and all of a sudden, 
        I had a new family. We ate together, played together, laughed together, 
        and partied together. Over everyday activities we bonded into an unstoppable 
        force.</p>
      <p>Clearly the most powerful aspect of JV soccer is not that it's convenient 
        for school or that it's better than the workout room - the most powerful 
        aspect is the family that comes with it. One member claims when asked 
        to, she &quot;wanted to offer a helping hand to another moose - that's 
        what JV soccer means.&quot; </p>
      <p>That attitude helped spark, in a matter of two or three years, a lightening 
        quick transition in the program transforming from an unknown athletic 
        team into a complete social entity. </p>
      <p>Commitment to JV soccer brings a lifetime membership. Seniors, juniors, 
        and first-years are linked together in a network of society whose heart 
        lies in the class of 2005. These girls possess an energy and love for 
        the sport and each other that is contagious. </p>
      <p>The same anonymous source stated, &quot;My favorite thing about JV soccer 
        is, without a doubt, the people. We have such an eclectic group of girls, 
        who when we come together, make an environment in which everyone has an 
        incredible time.&quot; </p>
      <p>For the record, the gatherings of these ladies do not end with the season. 
        There are continued celebrations for everything and everyone. And trust 
        me - these girls party with full intensity. </p>
      <p>Another anonymous source hinted, &quot;As long as there is T-shirt making 
        involved, you know it'll be a good party.&quot; In fact, you may be turned 
        from the door or invited to be re-dressed if you don't fit the established 
        code. </p>
      <p>However, when on the prowl, the team mentality takes over. They own a 
        campus-wide as if it were their playground (and perhaps that's just what 
        it is). JV pride? Don't mistake them for varsity. </p>
      <p>&quot;When it comes to JV soccer I can only say this-we are never at 
        a loss for booyah. And to those who think they can match us I say, bring 
        your own BOOYAH,&quot; boasts yet another anonymous source. Harvey added, 
        &quot;For JV soccer, the sky's the limit!&quot; </p>
      <p>Everything that encompasses &quot;sport&quot; - passion, joy, competition, 
        intensity, laughter, and balance are all at the center of the JV soccer 
        philosophy. It all began with a coaching mantra, &quot;Rock the party&quot; 
        and it built on the enthusiastic attitudes of original members such as 
        Gloria Shen ('03), Kate McCalmont ('04), and Jenny Harvey ('04). </p>
      <p>They love life and they love the game. Their passion seeped into and 
        infected the entire system. This translated into a group of girls who 
        have found sport, found friends; found Bowdoin. </p>
      <p>One insider marveled, &quot;JV soccer is an outlet, a place to feel absolutely 
        comfortable with people who you could goof around with and just be natural.&quot; 
        No doubt turnout is high for the team because people want to be there, 
        thanks in large part to the environment created by the veterans. </p>
      <p>Oddly enough, some honestly consider themselves lucky to be a part of 
        the B squad. After a couple of weeks, you realize all the opportunities 
        Bowdoin College does offer. JV offers a flexibility that counters the 
        limits placed on a member of the varsity squad. </p>
      <p>From 4p.m. - 6p.m. you are on the field, but then you are free for Miscellenia 
        or BOCA, Obvious or Vague, you can go to a campus job, or you can be a 
        mentor or a tutor, or any combination of the endless outside activities 
        that Bowdoin avails you. Life is full, but balanced. </p>
      <p>Senior member Shen announces, &quot;The words 'Bowdoin JV Soccer' have 
        really come to be synonymous with domination. Over the past few years, 
        we have built a team, an empire, nay, a Mecca, of athletic greatness. 
        Booyah!&quot; </p>
      <p>So watch out for these girls-they sing, they dance, they teach, they 
        eat, they party, and all the while they are capable of playing a pretty 
        mean game of soccer. </p>
