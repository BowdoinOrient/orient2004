      <p align="left"><font size="5">President Mills mulls College expansion</font><font size="5"><br>
        <font size="2">JESSE McCREE<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Even though President Barry Mills has just recently begun 
        his tenure at the College, he has already started to discuss plans for 
        his vision of an improved Bowdoin. Along with the rest of the Bowdoin 
        Board of Trustees, Mills has begun to investigate the possible expansion 
        of the student body by approximately 200 students. This expansion would 
        be implemented with the goals of strengthening the intellectual diversity 
        while still maintaining the intimate educational atmosphere that Bowdoin 
        emphasizes.</p>
      <p align="left">Even though the College grew in enrollment throughout the 
        1990s, Mills feels that continuing to expand may allow Bowdoin to adapt 
        better to the changing times. Although Mills stressed that his plans are 
        not definitive but simply &quot;worth talking about,&quot; he remained 
        optimistic that his vision could benefit the College. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think if we got somewhat larger we may be able to 
        continue to deepen and strengthen both academic departments and the intellectual 
        life on campus. But I think it's something we really need to investigate.&quot; 
        Mills cited that fact that Bowdoin &quot;is nearly the smallest school 
        in the cohort that we consider ourselves a part of,&quot; and that expansion 
        might allow the College to become more comparable in size without adversely 
        affecting the academic programs or social life. </p>
      <p align="left">Also by expanding the College, more room would be given 
        to increase the diversity of the student body as well as attracting more 
        prospective students because of the increased size and diversity. However, 
        Mills is also very aware of some of the logistics that must be considered 
        if the College is to expand. By bringing in more students every year, 
        there are basic issues that need to be addressed to effectively maintain 
        their needs.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There are a lot of issues that we need to think about,&quot; 
        said Mills. &quot;There are issues related to facilities, student housing, 
        residential life, class size, academic programs, let alone the finances 
        of the College.&quot; On the topic of finances, Mills also stressed the 
        importance of endowment per student. Because an increase in the student 
        body would dilute the endowment per student, careful steps need to be 
        taken by the administration to balance the number of students to maximize 
        the financial well-being of the College. <br>
        Said Mills, &quot;I really think that it's important for places like Bowdoin 
        to focus on endowment per student. Because we are not tuition-driven, 
        the endowment allows us to do what is special at this college.&quot; Students' 
        perspectives have been mixed about the discussion of the expansion of 
        the college. </p>
      <p align="left">Namsoo Lee '01 said that increasing the number of students 
        and the diversity at Bowdoin &quot;would make it more possible to share 
        ideas,&quot; but also commented that he thought addition of a few hundred 
        kids &quot;would not make a significant enough improvement at Bowdoin 
        to outweigh the costs.&quot; Jon Rizzo '06 also had mixed opinions on 
        the possibility of expanding the College. &quot;I think that it's a positive 
        that we are looking to improve the student body here,&quot; he says. &quot;Increasing 
        the number would help improve academic diversity, but I am not sure that 
        it would be a large impact with only 200 more students.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Although Mills realizes that his vision for the improvement 
        of Bowdoin will take multiple years of planning and implementation, he 
        feels as though the school owes to itself the investigation of whether 
        an increase in students will benefit the college. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think that there is a lot of support for the discussion 
        of expanding the college. There are reasons why it's worth talking about, 
        in terms of deepening the academic life here. But beyond that I think 
        that we need to do the work and really think about it,&quot; he said.
