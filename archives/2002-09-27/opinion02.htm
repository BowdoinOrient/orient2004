        <font size="2">GENEVIEVE CREEDON</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> One of my friends was sitting in my room earlier today 
        creating a plan to suspend a train set from his ceiling, and after ten 
        minutes of his imaginings, someone informed him that most of us had grown 
        out of that stage. Then, I asked: &quot;Do you ever think of anything 
        realistic?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It is realistic,&quot; he replied, &quot;I could do 
        it.&quot; And he could, and it would be a great thing to see, so what's 
        wrong with the idea?</p>
      <p align="left">When my brother was very young, he used to fantasize about 
        flying cars. Anyone he liked was allowed into his flying car, and it was 
        an honor to be granted passage. Now my brother is in business school, 
        and he cringes at the mention of the flying car.</p>
      <p align="left">I'm kicking myself right now for my response to the suspended 
        train set, because there is nothing wrong with the idea, except that it's 
        not particularly economical, useful or space efficient. It's impulsive, 
        but impulsive isn't always bad. </p>
      <p align="left">If I think about it, probably the most impulsive thing I've 
        done in the past year was getting my hair cut, last November. Two weeks 
        ago, I wrote about the necessity for change. Maybe change is about impulse 
        and spontaneity. </p>
      <p align="left">We are so constricted by expectations and images of what 
        we should be and how we should think. We don't know how to invest our 
        minds to break down those expectations. We stick with releases that require 
        no thought: watching screens, drinking, getting high on artificiality.</p>
      <p align="left">For two weeks, I've been trying to decide how to use a gift 
        certificate I received. For a few days I toyed with getting the K'NEX 
        Ferris wheel (ages nine and up), which runs on a battery. My roommate 
        even told me she was heartened by my inclination. Of course, I keep telling 
        myself it will be useless; it won't really contribute to my personal growth 
        in any way, so I fall back on books. I love books and reading. They're 
        useful; I'll have them for the rest of my life. Realistically, what am 
        I going to do with a battery operated, three-foot tall Ferris wheel?</p>
      <p align="left">Well, first I would put it together, and then it would probably 
        sit somewhere in my room, and every once in a while I'd turn it on, watch 
        it run, and probably marvel at the mechanical perfection of the moment. 
        So, I don't really know why I won't just let myself get it. It's not even 
        going to cost me anything. </p>
      <p align="left">My excuse continues to be that I don't need a toy Ferris 
        wheel, which is true, but I don't really need anything for that matter. 
        My friend doesn't really need a suspended train set, but we do need what 
        those things embody. We need wonder; we need imagination; we need spontaneity; 
        we need impulse. We need the willingness and desire not only to suspend 
        trains from the ceiling, but to suspend ourselves a few inches above the 
        things we already know. </p>
