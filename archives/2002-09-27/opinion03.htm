        <font size="2">LARA JACOBS</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;Come on, almost at the top&#133;.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">No, I'm not coaching myself up the mountain of purgatory 
        or even Katahdin, only up the four flights of stairs leading to my dorm 
        room. Usually living on the fourth floor isn't that big of a deal. </p>
      <p align="left">Yes, in all honesty, I find myself opting for the elevator 
        instead of the stairs in the library, or choosing the ramp in Smith Union, 
        and perhaps I groan more often when I realize that I left the day's homework 
        on my bed requiring a return trip; but typically the stairs don't bother 
        me too much.</p>
      <p align="left">Tonight, however, I just got back from tutoring at the Kennedy 
        Center in Portland, and with each step the burden of the paper needing 
        to be written and the reading waiting to be read weighs a little more 
        heavily on my shoulders. </p>
      <p align="left">When combined with my headache from reading Beowulf with 
        an ESL student, from racking my brain for any details from my seventh 
        grade study of Lord of the Flies for a boy's English paper, from revisiting 
        ionic bonding that I thought I had finally freed myself from my final 
        day of chemistry class junior year, it's no wonder I'm a little out of 
        breath. </p>
      <p align="left">So, you may be wondering at this point, why am I in this 
        situation? Why do I volunteer? Step back sometimes and ask yourself why 
        you're doing what you are-it's not so you can put it on a college application 
        like in high school, and it's not something that your parents signed you 
        up for. In college what I do and how I spend my time are self-selected, 
        consequently I'm responsible for my exhaustion. </p>
      <p align="left">Yet, despite the fatigue, working with kids is a reprieve 
        from the hectic and in some ways unreal school life at Bowdoin. On campus 
        I am often guilty of getting stressed over work still to be done or a 
        meeting still to attend. </p>
      <p align="left">Therefore helping a girl who is eighteen, married to a thirty-six 
        year old, mother of one, and studying for a nursing degree, reminds me 
        of how fortunate I am that my stress comes from something as detached 
        from life as a paper on The Oresteian Trilogy. </p>
      <p align="left">On a campus where the largest problem can be not finding 
        time to eat after a class but before the Orient meeting, it's important 
        sometimes to step back from the &quot;Bowdoin bubble&quot; and remember 
        people who don't have anything to eat at all. </p>
      <p align="left">I volunteer because I believe that if you are lucky enough 
        to have had a family that read you stories growing up and that encouraged 
        you to shoot for the moon and study hard in order to go to a top school, 
        it's important to try to pass on and to share some of these gifts and 
        these opportunities. </p>
      <p align="left">Although I come back to my dorm tired and settle in for 
        a long night of studying, I still have my paper to write and my play to 
        read, I'm aware of the distinction between the urgent versus the important, 
        and realize that I'm fortunate enough to have most of what's important 
        covered and that I'll finish the urgent-my school work-by morning. </p>
      <p align="left">Ultimately, the other vital part of Common Good Day lies 
        in its title-common. Good should be insignificant because we are doing 
        it significantly; it should be a routine part of our lives. </p>
      <p align="left">By all means build for Habitat or tutor or paint this upcoming 
        Saturday, but also remember that the 28th is only one of many opportunities 
        we have for doing &quot;good&quot;-each day we have the power to hurt, 
        to encourage, to comfort, or to console family, friends, classmates, acquaintances, 
        and strangers. </p>
      <p align="left">What we do with that power, whether or not we help pick 
        up the food a girl drops in Thorne, or stand up for a guy our friend just 
        belittled, or listen to our brother who just got dumped for the first 
        time, or help a girl from Senegal study for the SATs to create a better 
        life, is indicative of how we live our own lives. </p>
      <p align="left">This Saturday is not just an annual event, but rather one 
        more opportunity for us to use our personal power in ways that reach beyond 
        our own well being, one more chance we have to &quot;do good&quot;. </p>
