        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p>The best art in New York is not necessarily at the Met. Chris Doyle will 
        argue this point with anyone. For the past several years he has been experimenting 
        with both public art projects and the video work being shown in public 
        spaces. Tuesday night, after refuting the myth that artists do not like 
        to talk about their work, he welcomed the Kresge crowd into his world. 
        By focusing on the relationships between public and personal, individual 
        and group, and finding beauty in the mundane, Doyle creates a truly unique 
        and animated body of work.</p>
      <p>Not only does Doyle frame his works in public spaces, he often involves 
        the public as well. In his work Commutable, Doyle chose to transform the 
        New York Williamsburg Bridge, a route used by hundreds of commuters everyday 
        between Williamsburg and the Lower East Side. Focusing on the extremely 
        abused, syringe-littered stairway to this pedestrian overpass, he and 
        a small crew covered the staircase with 3x3&quot; pieces of 24K gold leaf. 
        Knowing that the bridge was located between two poor immigrant communities, 
        he stated that the idea of &quot;paving the streets with gold&quot; was 
        in his mind as he executed his plan. He hoped that the gold would slowly 
        erode and be carried throughout the city on the soles of the commuters' 
        feet. </p>
      <p>Being outside the studio for ten days pushed Doyle to think about how 
        he could continue to involve people more directly with his work. LEAP 
        was his answer. This project took place in Columbus Circle, Manhattan, 
        and stretched forty feet in the air. Columbus Circle is a point where 
        eleven subway-end-points converge, giving Doyle the opportunity to meet 
        with people from all five boroughs. He filmed 420 New Yorkers each jumping 
        alone in front of a black back-drop and then questioned them about their 
        dreams and aspirations. The result was a phenomenal projection of New 
        Yorkers of every age, color, and size leaping skyward. He described this 
        as &quot;an anti-celebrity piece of work.&quot; By magnifying everyday 
        people doing an ordinary movement, he found his favorite part of the work 
        was not the complete abandon they had as they leapt, but the &quot;Buster 
        Keaton aspect&quot; he didn't expect; those precious few moments as people 
        readied themselves for the leap. Their individual reactions became a type 
        of art all on their own.</p>
      <p>Another way to let everyday people have their fifteen minutes of fame 
        was to turn the University of Michigan Museum &quot;inside out&quot;. 
        Doyle saw the museum's collection of 18th and 19th century portraits of 
        wealthy individuals to be an unjust representation of the people who lived 
        at this time. Because he didn't want to see the same mistake happen twice, 
        he mixed these portraits with video clips of members of the UM campus 
        and projected them onto the side of the museum. The project, entitled 
        What I See When I Look at You, was an extension of his belief in getting 
        art out of the museum.</p>
      <p>Aside from monumental outdoor works, Doyle experimented with stop motion; 
        he called these projects his &quot;back yard&quot; projects because of 
        his intimate relationship with them. He described stop motion as being 
        thousands of sculptures combined to make a whole - much like Commutable. 
        By exploring stop motion he brought things to life that to the rest of 
        us seem dead. Something like, say, the brick and the hot dog. He found 
        beauty in the repetition and possibilities that hide in these apparently 
        lifeless subjects and displayed the hot dogs on 30 foot projectors and 
        his bricks on three split screens. </p>
      <p>Processed meat and uniform rectangles never looked so glamorous. Doyle 
        is always interested in the social pressure to be unique, and that is 
        one theme his &quot;back yard&quot; projects challenge. To him they certainly 
        became an entity of their own. Regarding the hotdogs he stated, &quot;It's 
        hard for me to look at that and not feel fondly about my actors.&quot;</p>
      <p>Whether it's food, stone, humans, or gold, Chris Doyle creates a very 
        personal and humanistic art that admires the masses but doesn't forget 
        the individual pieces that add together to make the whole possible. For
