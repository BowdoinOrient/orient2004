        <font size="2">ERIK SPRAGUE<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The 2002 edition of the Boston Red Sox left a lot to be 
        desired this season. As a result, many Boston fans and media outlets seized 
        the chance to criticize one of the highest payrolls in baseball for what 
        they deemed a season marred by underachieving. </p>
      <p align="left">It is indeed difficult to recall a more unfulfilling and 
        disappointing season. Not only did the Sox have two twenty-game winners 
        in Derek Lowe and Pedro Martinez, both of whom are still in the hunt for 
        the American League Cy Young award, but also they undoubtedly had one 
        of the best batting lineups in baseball. </p>
      <p align="left">All of this talent, however, did not even add up to a playoff 
        birth, which is a difficult pill for Red Sox fans to swallow.<br>
        The extent to which Sox fans and the Boston media have turned sour on 
        the Sox this year is not shocking, and it probably should have been expected. 
        But it has gotten so bad in recent weeks due to the Sox's slow but sure 
        elimination from the playoffs, it caused fan-favorite Nomar Garciaparra 
        to lash out. </p>
      <p align="left">In an interview last week, Garciaparra eluded to the fact 
        that perhaps the disparity between the great success of the Sox on the 
        road and their unequivocally mediocre play at home can, in part, be attributed 
        to the negative &quot;vibes&quot; given off by the volatile Boston fans 
        and media. <br>
        Despite reinforcing his desire to play out his career with the team he 
        broke into the majors with back in 1996, Garciaparra's strikingly out-of-character 
        comments have made him a convenient target for the Boston fans and media, 
        both of whom are looking for anything to help them vent after a season 
        filled with frustration.</p>
      <p align="left">At first glance, Garciappara's comments can be described 
        as unnecessary and even irrational. However, although there is not solely 
        one reason for the demise of the Sox this season, I would agree with Nomar 
        that the fans themselves are part of the problem. </p>
      <p align="left">First off, Boston fans are among the best in the country. 
        They continue to support their teams during the good years and bad. Although 
        the Sox have not won a World Series since 1918, Fenway Park is continuously 
        sold out. <br>
        That said, sometimes it appears that the amount of negative attention 
        and focus that the Sox acquire can place an undue burden on the players. 
        Even the most professional ballplayer must be somewhat affected by the 
        highly critical, negative atmosphere that is prevalent at Fenway Park, 
        as well as throughout the Boston media at large. </p>
      <p align="left">This atmosphere has driven the likes of Roger Clemens and 
        Rick Patino out of town. For many in the Boston area, these sports figures 
        might not be held in the highest regards. But, losing a player of the 
        caliber of Roger Clemens, whose disdain for the Red Sox was so great that 
        he was willing to move to rival Toronto is unfortunate</p>
      <p align="left">Now, some would say that Clemens primarily left the Sox 
        because the Blue Jays were offering him more money or because he continued 
        to butt heads with Sox upper management. In other words, it was these 
        two factors, and not the negative, critical atmosphere created by the 
        Boston media and fans, that caused Roger to leave town.</p>
      <p align="left">In the case of Rick Patino, however, money could not have 
        been a factor in his decision-making process. In fact, the contract he 
        signed was at that time the highest-priced one in NBA history. Moreover, 
        he was still under contract when he finally did decide to leave Boston. 
        Essentially, Patino gave up millions just so he didn't have to coach or 
        live in Boston one minute longer.</p>
      <p align="left">Many are aware of the short tirade by Patino that precipitated 
        his departure. It was highlighted by one statement in particular, when 
        he said the attitude around here (Boston) &quot;sucks.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Of course, most fans felt that Patino should have used that 
        adjective to describe the poor play of the Celtics or even himself, as 
        he was not only the coach but also the General Manager - which meant he 
        had been responsible for the personnel decisions. </p>
      <p align="left">That said, Patino, like Garciapparra last week, was commenting 
        on something that is an unfortunate but very real part of the Boston sports 
        scene. </p>
      <p align="left">Boston fans expect a degree of excellence when it comes 
        to their sports teams, part of which is probably due to the huge success 
        of teams like the Celtics, who have amassed 17 World Championships - only 
        the Yankees have won as many championships in one professional sport.</p>
      <p align="left">In today's game with exorbitant ticket prices resulting 
        from highly overpaid players, it is the fans' right to voice their opinions, 
        even if it is in the form of boos directed at their own team. And freedom 
        of speech will always enable the media to print and report on whatever 
        they choose, no matter how cynical and critical they become. </p>
      <p align="left">However, at the same time, it is important to note that 
        some players, Nomar being the most recent example, don't respond positively 
        to the negative atmosphere surrounding Boston sports. </p>
      <p align="left">Many Boston fans, if not most, were glad to see Clemens 
        and Patino leave Boston. Boston fans are quick to place the blame on both 
        individuals for their early departures.</p>
      <p align="left">It seems as though Boston fans, as well as the media, feel 
        they have a blank check to be as critical and negative as they desire, 
        and that no ill effects could possibly come from it. Perhaps they are 
        right. But there is no ignoring the poor home record of the Sox this year, 
        as well as the stinging comments from Nomar.</p>
      <p align="left">It's bad enough that the Sox, with one of the highest payrolls 
        in baseball and two twenty-game winners, did not even make the playoffs. 
        But now Nomar, the heart of the Sox, has voiced his concerns about the 
        people of Boston. <br>
        The Boston fans and media need to take a long, hard look in the mirror. 
        One of the nicest people and hardest workers in all of sports has questioned 
        your town and expressed his own discomfort stemming from the negative 
        atmosphere surrounding the various sports teams. </p>
      <p align="left">If you didn't already question yourselves when Clemens and 
        Patino left, maybe now is a good time to start. </p>
