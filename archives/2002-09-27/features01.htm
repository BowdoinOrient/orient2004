        COLUMNIST</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p>Tuesday afternoon the Federal Reserve Board decided to leave interest 
        rates unchanged at 1.75 percent again. Although this was expected, it 
        was a surprise to hear of the dissents by two of the 12-person board. 
        This dissension by two members seemed to send the stock market plummeting 
        again to its lowest mark since 1998. </p>
      <p>Although I do not even pretend to be an expert on the economy, it seems 
        to me that there is an air of uncertainty about the near future of the 
        economy.<br>
        Many people argue that we are coming out of poorer economic times, but 
        there are many indicators that seem indicate otherwise. The last time 
        we came out of a recession the trade deficit was not actually a deficit, 
        but a surplus.</p>
      <p>However, right now the U.S. has its largest trade deficit ever, more 
        than five percent of domestic output. This is one of the reasons why the 
        Fed has been able to keep the interest rate this low for so long. The 
        Fed usually has to increase the interest to attract investment from around 
        the world during hard economic times, but U.S. products and companies 
        have been able to attract investors despite low interest rates. This is 
        probably because the U.S. is the only economy that has continued to expand. 
        However, if foreign investment begins to drag, this will be bad news for 
        the U.S., as the value of the dollar could plummet, as a result of increased 
        interest rates to counteract lack of foreign, giving rise to inflation, 
        and further economic woes. Unfortunately the drop in foreign investment 
        has already begun with foreign waning in light of the troubles surrounding 
        corporate malfeasance.</p>
      <p>In addition to this there is concern that the strongest sector of the 
        economy during the recession, the housing market, may be beginning to 
        fade itself. Even though the housing market is expected to set record 
        highs this year, existing housing sales dropped by 1.7 percent in August 
        signaling troubles in that sector. If the housing market falls through, 
        and the rest of the economy does not pick up the slack, this could be 
        disastrous for the economy.<br>
        The biggest question surrounding the economy is the situation in Iraq. 
        The potential for a war in Iraq has everybody worried about the future 
        of the economy. A war with Iraq would have great effects on our economy-the 
        biggest being the price of oil. Crude oil prices shot to a 19-month high 
        just on concerns about a war with Iraq. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, President Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence Lindsey, 
        Class of '76) said that a war with Iraq would cost the U.S. $100 billion, 
        but Lindsey believes that this wouldn't lead to another recession. </p>
      <p>This uncertainty about the future price of oil and the overall state 
        of the economy has most likely left investors very uncertain about what 
        to do with their money. This is reflected in economic analysts lowering 
        their fourth quarter estimates for the economy.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, also said that he did 
        not think that a war with Iraq would lead to another recession. However, 
        the dissent by two of the members of the Federal Reserve Board indicates 
        that some don't share Greenspan's certainty about the economy.</p>
      <p>It appears that the economy is walking a thin tight rope right now that 
        could e broken by many factors. This apparent instability of the market 
        is probably why so many experts are in opposition and most investors are 
        in a daze. If current conditions hold, the economy could see a recovery 
        in the near future, but if any conditions change, the economy could slip 
        back into another recession that would probably be longer and worse than 
        the last one. </p>
