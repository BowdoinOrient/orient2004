      The Disembodied Spirit, a compilation of art from the late 19th and late 
      20th centuries depicting ghosts and members of the spirit world, opened 
      yesterday at the Walker Museum of Art.
<p>The exhibit features the work of artists including William Mumler, Georgiana 
        Houghton, Julia Margaret Cameron, Jeremy Blake, Nancy Burson, Gregory 
        Crewdson, Anna Gaskell, Ann Hamilton, Glenn Ligon, Tracey Moffatt, Mariko 
        Mori, and Bill Viola.</p>
      <p>The show explores ghosts and spirits as they interact with humans and 
        as they act as representatives of other cultural issues such as the AIDS 
        epidemic and the traumas of adolescence. Many of the earlier works also 
        deal with spiritualism, a predominantly 19th century belief in the soul's 
        immortality. Spiritualists often tried to establish communications with 
        the spirit world through various methods, and these attempts inspired 
        many of the earlier works in the show. The artists submitted works in 
        various mediums, including film, photography, painting, and sculpture.</p>
      <p>One of the more bizarre phenomena in the show is the photography of ectoplasm, 
        an ephemeral substance that fascinated many late 19th century photographers 
        of the spiritual world. Many people at the time believed that the bodies 
        of people in contact with the spirit world occasionally emitted a strange 
        white substance called ectoplasm, which was the refuse of spirits. It 
        was supposedly only visible through the camera lens and disappeared upon 
        contact with light. </p>
      <p>Late 19th century photographers used this myth as inspiration for their 
        photographs, in which they used double exposures to create images within 
        the ectoplasm. The show includes various 19th century depictions of ectoplasm, 
        as well as some late 20th century photographs they inspired.</p>
      <p>The butterfly is also a prevalent image in the show as a symbol of the 
        spirit world. One of its most striking inclusions is Gregory Crewdson's 
        untitled photograph. The piece shows a young girl standing in her backyard 
        looking at a garage, which is emitting a strange, glowing light and out 
        of which flies a cloud of butterflies.</p>
      <p>Another striking piece is Jeremy Blake's film, Winchester, inspired by 
        the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California. Its owner, Sara 
        Winchester, a spiritualist, constructed the house as a home for ghosts. 
        The continuously looping film combines photographs of the house with other 
        images in an attempt to represent the ideas and paranoia within Winchester's 
        mind.</p>
      <p>The concept for the show grew from the mind of Alison Ferris, the Museum's 
        curator. &quot;Part of my job is going to art galleries,&quot; said Ferris. 
        &quot;My inspiration came from the contemporary art world and the many 
        contemporary artists using ghosts as inspiration.&quot; The show features 
        a range of artists and styles. </p>
      <p>Ferris said, &quot;What's exciting for me is to see them all together, 
        to see them interact with each other.&quot; In fact, many of the pieces 
        seem to take on greater significance in the context of the show as a whole.</p>
      <p>Ferris hopes the show will do more than just stimulate the viewers visually. 
        &quot;I hope people's imaginations [will] be engaged,&quot; she said. 
        The show features both 19th century photography and the modern art it 
        has influenced. </p>
      <p>&quot;People can be seduced by technology-you can leave your body behind, 
        enter the spirit world, and take on other identities, yet our history, 
        our societal, political and race issues will ultimately remind us [of 
        our humanity],&quot; she noted.</p>
      <p>For those of us who may not pick up on these thought-provoking issues 
        right off the bat, the museum will be featuring several speakers throughout 
        the course of the fall. Two of these speakers are Bowdoin professors: 
        Madeleine Msall, Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy, will lecture 
        on November 5, and Peter Coviello, assistant English professor, will speak 
        on November 12.</p>
      <p>In her lecture, entitled &quot;Rational Ghosts-The Allure of Scientific 
        Theories of the Unseen,&quot; Msall said she plans to discuss &quot;how 
        vocabulary and images from the frontiers of theoretical science are appropriated 
        by non-scientists to connect supernatural experiences with natural philosophy.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>She said, &quot;Often such borrowings are intended to validate non-scientific 
        ideas by giving them a patina of rationalism, but sometimes the intent 
        is a critique of science and a dialogue contrasting the richness of human 
        experience with the limitations of science.&quot;</p>
      <p>In his lecture, &quot;Ghosts of Freud,&quot; Coviello said he will discuss 
        Freud's fascination with ghosts-&quot;how Freud sought to understand the 
        ghostly-and how Freud, in turn, deepened our own sense of what&#133;ghosts 
        might mean.&quot; Ferris asked him to lecture because some of his work 
        at Bowdoin deals both with Freud and with ghost-related works of other 
        writers. Coviello said the show is &quot;beautiful, challenging, and incisive, 
        and provoking in the very best sense. I love particularly how intriguingly 
        the 19th and 20th century works speak to one another. It manages to be 
        weird, comic, grave, intensely beautiful-and somehow entirely coherent.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I love the museum,&quot; said Coviello. &quot;It is, I think, an 
        absolutely amazing institution, and a true gift for the College to have, 
        so I'm always happy to be part of their programming.&quot;</p>
      <p>Other lecturers speaking in relation to the exhibition include Marina 
        Warner, a writer of fiction, history, and criticism; John Jacob, the former 
        director of the Photographic Resource Center in Boston; and Tom Gunning, 
        a Professor of Art History and Criticism at the University of Chicago. 
        Warner will speak at the opening reception on October 3, Gunning on October 
        30, and Jacob on October 8.</p>
      <p>The show will run from September 25 to December 7.<br>
