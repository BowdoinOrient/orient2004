      </table>The Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team had another outstanding week, improving 
      upon its already perfect record to 5-0. They started with a huge victory 
      over Williams College on Saturday morning and continued with a win against 
      Plymouth State in monsoon-like rain on Tuesday afternoon.
      <p>Last season, during the NESCAC semifinals, the Polar Bears suffered a 
        heartbreaking loss to Williams in a shootout after double overtime; they 
        were not going to let it happen again and were ready to play from the 
        start. Only six minutes into the game senior captain Hillary Smith rifled 
        a shot directly at the Williams keeper. It was deflected directly towards 
        Chrissy Goss '04 who was waiting to knock it home for the first goal of 
        the game. The early lead gave the ladies a huge boost of confidence and 
        maintained their momentum. </p>
      <p>Senior midfielder Michal Shapiro attributed much of the team's great 
        play to its energy and intensity, as well as its collective composure: 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We came out strong from the beginning and Williams did not know 
        how to respond to us. We took the game away from them and played with 
        our hearts but also with our heads. In games that are so intense, it is 
        easy at times to be playing as hard as you can but also easy to loose 
        composure and skill. We maintained both.&quot;</p>
      <p>What was most impressive about Bowdoin was its ability to control the 
        speed of the game through their fantastic passing. The midfield, led by 
        seniors Shapiro, Smith, and Julie Barnes, was able to possess the ball 
        with extreme confidence, which allowed the three to see the field and 
        distribute the ball effectively to the aggressive Bowdoin offense. Although 
        the Polar Bears did not score for the rest of the first half, their intensity 
        and hustle was evident. They controlled the pace of the game and beat 
        Williams to nearly every 50/50 ball. </p>
      <p>The second half began and senior Jillian Falwell was hungry. She continued 
        her relentless play upfront as well as her scoring streak with a beautiful 
        goal off a great feed from Barnes five minutes into the second half. </p>
      <p>The bears were not giving the Purple Cows a minute to breathe. Falwell 
        notched her second impressive goal of the game at 60:59. Receiving a long 
        pass from goalie Anna Shappel '05, she used her lightening speed to single-handedly 
        beat the Williams defense and their keeper, placing the ball in the back 
        corner of the net. Falwell's natural ability to finish was hard to beat. 
        When she has the ball, she is one of the hardest players to defend in 
        the NESCAC. </p>
      <p>Of equal importance to the attacking offense and confident midfield was 
        the outstanding play of the indestructible Bowdoin defense, led by junior 
        Kendall Cox. The communication among the back four was outstanding. They 
        knew where each other were and were rarely caught out of position. Twice 
        in the second half Williams was left with an open net, but the Bowdoin 
        defenders remained composed and stopped every offensive attack made by 
        the Purple Cows. Keeper Shappel contributed greatly to the Bowdoin backfield 
        making eight saves, as well as earning her second shutout of the year.</p>
      <p>The Polar Bears left everything on the field on Saturday. Their intensity 
        could not be matched even by a very talented and hardworking Williams 
        team. Shapiro said, &quot;Playing games against an opponent like Williams 
        is one of the reasons why you play the game of soccer: to push yourself 
        and your teammates to the next level. It was an amazing game to play in 
        because our intensity, focus, and composure were there for all 90 <br>
        minutes.&quot; </p>
      <p>Tuesday afternoon in a horrendous rain and windstorm, the Polar Bears 
        came out on top again beating Plymouth State 2-0. With the rain pouring 
        onto the field, the polar bears had a difficult time finding their rhythm. 
        Although they outshot the Panthers, they could not find the back of the 
        net and went into the half tied 0-0. </p>
      <p>However, the adverse conditions could not keep them down. Four minutes 
        into the second half, Chrissy Goss '04 made a nice feed to Cedar Goldman 
        '05 who knocked the ball into the lower corner of the net for the first 
        goal of the game. Shortly after, a scuffle in the box led a loose ball 
        to the feet of first year Elizabeth Graham who promptly found the back 
        of the net, putting the bears up 2-0 at 56:38. Bowdoin did not need to 
        worry about adding to the score as keeper Rebekah Metzler '04 made four 
        saves and earned her first shutout of the season. </p>
      <p>This weekend the Polar Bears have a tough and important double header. 
        Facing two NESCAC powerhouses, Amherst and Middlebury, will be a challenge 
        for Bowdoin but a challenge they are not afraid to take. Shapiro stated, 
        &quot;Our coaches are preparing us by having great practices where the 
        entire team plays hard and creates a supportive environment. We are taking 
        every inch around us!&quot;<br>
