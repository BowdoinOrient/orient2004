      <p align="left"><font size="5">Wesley Clark makes it ten<br></font>
        <font size="2">ALEXANDER REED<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Former General Wesley Clark, for better or worse, threw 
        himself into the Democratic presidential nomination process on Semptember 
        17, an action which is sure to further complicate the already frenzied 
        and fragmented struggle to unseat President Bush in 2004. The former general, 
        it must be said, has impressive qualifications, which no doubt make him 
        attractive to many Democrats desperately searching for a candidate with 
        &quot;backbone&quot; and credibility.</p>
      <p align="left">Clark, having served as Supreme Allied Commander of NATO 
        forces in Europe during the Clinton Administration, certainly possesses 
        credentials which ensure not only his professional integrity, but also 
        his overseas credibility - something the Bush Administration lacks at 
        this time.</p>
      <p align="left">Thus, it is easy to see why many Democrats view the former 
        general as their knight in shining armor. In addition to his impressive 
        professional military career, Clark also exhibits many similarities to 
        the spiritual figurehead of the Democratic Party-- Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p align="left">Both men grew up in Arkansas, worked their way through school 
        to become Rhodes Scholars, and sought careers which many people from their 
        home would never have dreamed of pursuing. However, as ambitious and popular 
        as Clark might be among Democrats, the question remains of whether or 
        not he can unite the party itself in time for the election, and if he 
        can, will he actually be able to lead the party to victory against the 
        Republican juggernaut? </p>
      <p>The determining factor in the question of whether or not Clark can get 
        his own party to rally behind him, will likely be his performance in national 
        polls. At this point, the Democratic Party cannot afford to nominate a 
        candidate (without naming names) who may only be the elixir of alienated 
        liberals. </p>
      <p>Instead, the Democratic Party must nominate a candidate who appeals to 
        everyone from union workers, immigrants, business CEOs, Missouri militiamen, 
        to the population of San Francisco. The Democrats know very well that 
        they cannot lose any more of their already thinning constituency, and 
        therefore must seek a nominee who can not only satisfy the &quot;old liberals&quot; 
        such as Senator Kennedy, but who can also bring back the people who the 
        Bush administration has swayed by the war on terrorism and the promise 
        of a tax cut.</p>
      <p>Former General Wesley Clark may, in fact, possess this ability. He cannot 
        be viewed as soft on terrorism because of his exemplary militray background 
        and statement that he would have voted for the war on Iraq, but also cannot 
        be viewed as a neo-conservative warmonger because of his close ties to 
        former President Bill Clinton and long-standing affiliation with the Democratic 
        Party. Thus, among Dems, Clark has even overtaken Howard Dean in popularity, 
        winning the support of 14 percent of registered Democrats, while Howard 
        Dean remains at 12 percent.</p>
      <p>However, some remain doubtful of the former general's ability to gain 
        the formal support of his party, and about his ability to lead the Democrats 
        to victory in 2004. GOP pollster Whit Ayres, in an MSNBC interview, said 
        Clark is &quot;way behind in money and organization,&quot; and believes 
        that the former general's chances of nomination depend &quot;on how well 
        he will perform in the Democratic caucuses in Iowa and the New Hampshire 
        primaries.&quot; Time will tell whether or not Clark will indeed be able 
        to unite not only his party, but enough voters to take the seat in the 
        oval office.</p>
      <p>Still, Americans have a great respect for the military profession, an 
        equally great desire to feel safe in the post 9/11 world, and an even 
        greater wish that America regains its former role as a bastion of democracy 
        and freedom. If average American voters, therefore, had to choose between 
        a brilliant, revered four star general, and a man who was able to help 
        land a plane on an aircraft carrier in the task of protecting them from 
        terrrorists and leading their country to its former pinnacle, then the 
        election might be very, very close. <br>
