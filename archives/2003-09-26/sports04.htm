      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Men's Soccer Team proved itself worthy of its 
        national ranking with relentless play in the face of adversity last Saturday 
        against Williams College. An epic contest, the Bears ended the game in 
        deadlock at 3-3. Bowdoin, ranked 5th in the latest poll, fell to the Ephs 
        early when Brett Olsen scored ten minutes into the game, followed by Josh 
        Bolton's goal just two minutes later.</p>
      <p>Many teams would become deflated, knowing that comebacks against quality 
        teams such as Williams are difficult at best. Bowdoin refused to panic, 
        however, as its confidence remained high. </p>
      <p>&quot;We knew we were the better team, and it showed after the two goals,&quot; 
        said Bobby Desilets '06, NESCAC player of the week. &quot;We outplayed 
        them and knew we could beat them despite our disappointment of giving 
        up two soft goals at the beginning of the game.&quot;</p>
      <p>The Polar Bears answered by controlling play for the rest of the half. 
        They were able to cut the lead to 2-1 thanks to a brilliant lead pass 
        from Andrew Russo '06 to Desilets, who drilled a right-footed blast into 
        the upper left corner of the goal from the 18 with 22 minutes remaining 
        in the half. The Polar Bears narrowly missed tying the game moments later 
        when a rocket from the foot of Ethan Roth '04 narrowly missed the right 
        post.</p>
      <p>During the second half, the Polar Bears continued their dominance, despite 
        the score remaining 2-1 in Williams' favor. With 15 minutes left in the 
        game, John Hollis '07 headed in a free kick from Jacques Guana '05. This 
        was an opportune time for the first year to score his first goal playing 
        for the black and white. </p>
      <p>The change in momentum was obvious, as the Polar Bears could smell blood 
        and continued to go for the Eph's jugular. Bowdoin outshot Williams 33-14 
        by the end of the game. Williams did still have one advantage, however: 
        Khari Stephenson. The senior from Jamaica was intent on giving Williams 
        the win in regulation and making the beautiful Bowdoin ladies on the sidelines 
        break into tears when he shot a laser inside the right post with just 
        2:36 left in the game. </p>
      <p>After the goal, the fans looked deflated, especially several very young 
        Polar Bear fans on the sideline. Their source of disappointment was not 
        from a seemingly imminent loss but rather from learning that the Batman 
        and Superman on the sidelines were actually Bowdoin students dressed in 
        costume. One could only feel empathy for their parents who probably had 
        to explain why Superman couldn't fly straight and Batman would get arrested 
        if he jumped behind the wheel of the Batmobile. Kids apparently just don't 
        understand that Natural Ice is the college student's kryptonite.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the only toxin in the blood of the players was adrenaline, which 
        allowed the Polar Bears, on the brink of exhaustion, to muster enough 
        to tie the game on one of the most improbable goals imaginable. </p>
      <p>Goalie Travis Derr '04 came up to take a free kick for Bowdoin, which 
        was redirected by Roth's header and found it's way between the goalie's 
        legs to Desilets' foot, which quickly deposited the ball into the back 
        of the Williams net, tying the score at three and causing general pandemonium 
        in the stands. </p>
      <p>&quot;The play that we scored on is almost like a hail Mary pass, you 
        just kick the ball into the box and hope for the best. I happened to be 
        in the right spot at the right time. You never expect to score with so 
        little time left on the clock, but when you do it's amazing,&quot; said 
        Desilets. </p>
      <p>Even though Bowdoin had the advantage in shots by a 5-1 margin in the 
        two overtime periods, neither team was able to get a golden goal. Derr 
        finished with five saves for Bowdoin, while Williams' Nick Armington stopped 
        13 Bowdoin shots. </p>
      <p>With one thrilling tie on the books and a 3-0-1 record to their credit, 
        the Polar Bears have a week of practice and rest to gear up for an even 
        bigger challenge of traveling this weekend to play perennial NESCAC contenders 
        Amherst and Middlebury. <br>
