      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"> I have a theory about social hierarchies at Bowdoin. Freshmen 
        girls start out on top-they're new, they're cute, they have no past to 
        haunt them, and they haven't been drinking beer for four years. Freshmen 
        boys, on the other hand, start out as eager, fresh-faced peons who arrive 
        wide-eyed, innocent and without any awe-inspiring war stories. But as 
        these boys up-grade from Coleman to Brunswick to the Tower or off-campus, 
        they begin to acquire things like a nickname, a swagger, and a couple 
        of girls they can say hate them.</p>
      <p>By their senior year, Bowdoin men are on top with everyone from fresh 
        meat to that girl they've had a crush on since Pre-O at their disposal. 
        And where, you ask, does the Senior Girl find herself amidst this elevator 
        of status? Let's just say she could lay herself down in the hole that 
        will be the foundation of Kanbar Hall and still be higher up than the 
        rest of her class. I would like to dedicate this week's column to THE 
        PLIGHT OF THE SENIOR GIRL.</p>
      <p>Poor Carrie is the paradigm of SeniorGirlitis. She began her Bowdoin 
        career getting in trouble with the lacrosse and hockey captains and enjoying 
        notoriety as one of a few who received phone calls from off-campus houses 
        to invite her to parties that other freshmen didn't know about. Carrie 
        was oh-so-cool. But now my pitiable friend finds herself in a wholly other 
        situation; &quot;As a freshman, I had four years of guys to choose from. 
        Now it's like I can either get arrested for pedophilia or watch my guy 
        friends be swamped by giggling little girls! I'm such a social outcast!&quot; 
        What sometimes strikes her most is that now, no one even remembers how 
        sought-after she once was; all the big men on campus have graduated. Let 
        us have a moment of silence to mourn Carrie's social life.</p>
      <p>Another old spinster, Amy, who started off in a similar place, has completely 
        forgone going out and prefers to sit at home and watch early Tom Cruise 
        movies rather than subject herself to the torture of watching Appleton 
        and Moore residents revel in the novelty of being young and hot. &quot;I 
        know it sounds silly,&quot; she confesses, &quot;but I really think I 
        understand now how Madonna feels as all these young popstars invade the 
        music industry. Am I going to have to make out onstage with one of the 
        rookies on my team to get any attention around here? Honestly, they were 
        born after Risky Business came out!&quot;</p>
      <p>There are, in fact, some senior girls who do resort to such antics (perhaps 
        not public tonsil-hockey, but at least dancing on tables and grinding 
        with each other to get noticed at their own parties); and really, can 
        you blame them? It's quite a blow to one's self-esteem to feel like an 
        old maid at the ripe age of 22. </p>
      <p>Of course, there are other options. Young Buck, for instance, was raised 
        from first-year obscurity by a brazen senior girl. This was not your ordinary 
        older woman; Buck was lucky enough to be picked out by a girl who was 
        known by universal epithet for having the most fantastic body on campus. 
        The big Buck hunter was not afraid to use her awe-inspiring status to 
        dominate a cute little first-year, and let me tell you, he did things 
        for this proverbial Stifler's mom that are anathema to anything he would 
        ever do for a younger girl, considering the position he 2003-09-26ly holds 
        on this campus. Another friend of mine, Will, dated senior girls in both 
        his freshman and sophomore years. He found that senior girls could inspire 
        both fear and admiration in the eyes of underclassmen, and what a turn-on 
        it was!</p>
      <p>Ramona, on the other hand, has chosen to undertake a mission for her 
        senior year. She is going after all the guys in her class that she has 
        wanted since her freshman year. This is a risky, but often quite worthwhile, 
        endeavor. It has worked for many in the past and if executed well, can 
        yield substantial rewards. </p>
      <p>Finally, there are the senior girls who just say, &quot;What the hell?&quot; 
        With a paltry nine months left beneath the pines, there is nothing to 
        fear. Mae, a near and dear friend who recently graduated, explained to 
        me her fourth-year m.o., &quot;I just thought to myself, 'Why not? There's 
        nothing I can do that will haunt me-no one in the real world cares what 
        happens here; lots of people haven't even heard of Bowdoin!' My advice 
        for single senior girls is to shamelessly take all you can. This is your 
        last opportunity to get all you want!&quot;</p>
      <p>And so, to those girls who find themselves at the dawn of their Bowdoin 
        careers, I say, enjoy it while you can. And senior girls, do not let the 
        seeming paucity of eligible bachelors dissuade you from having fun-there 
        is not enough time between now and May for you to wreak all the havoc 
        you can. To paraphrase the back of the Class of '04 t-shirts, you're not 
        here for a long time, you're here for a good time!<br>
