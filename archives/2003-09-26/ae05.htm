        <font size="2">JULIA GUERRERO READ<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      On July 16 of this year, Celia Cruz, the legendary singer known as the Queen 
      of Salsa, passed away at the age of 78. Although not very well known among 
      the Caucasian population of the America, Cruz is a household name among 
      the Spanish-speaking population of the world, from the United States to 
      South America to Spain. 
      <p>Her recently released posthumous album, Regalo del Alma, means &quot;gift 
        from the soul&quot; in Spanish, and it is indeed a parting gift from her 
        soul to ours. Although she was battling cancer at the time it was recorded, 
        it is as lively and danceable as ever. The first track in particular, 
        &quot;Elle Tiene Fuego,&quot; recorded with Spanish rapper El General, 
        is definitely a call to the dance floor. El General is not the first rapper 
        Celia has collaborated with; she recorded a remake of her famous hit &quot;Guantanamera&quot; 
        with Wyclef Jean a few years ago. Even into her 70s, Celia's deep, sonorous 
        voice shows no weakness; it is capable of reaching the soul of her audience, 
        whether it motivates them to go out on the dance floor or conjures up 
        images of her native Cuba.</p>
      <p>Celia Cruz was born on October 21, 1925, in a poor neighborhood of Havana. 
        From a very early age, her family recognized her singing ability, and 
        she won many talent contests. Although her father wanted her to be a teacher, 
        which really was the only acceptable profession for women at the time, 
        her mother supported her, and Celia studied at Cuba's National Music Conservatory. 
        After graduating, she joined the Cuban band La Sonora Matancera and became 
        their lead singer. </p>
      <p>She eventually married one of the group's trumpeters, Pedro Knight, and 
        they remained married for the rest of her life. In 1960, with Cuba under 
        the dictatorship of Fidel Castro, the group escaped to the United States 
        under the pretense of going there on tour. When they never returned, Castro 
        became angry and exiled her. She was not even allowed to return when her 
        parents became ill and died. Thanks to her indomitable spirit, however, 
        Celia and Pedro began a new life in the United States, spending most of 
        their time in New York City and Miami. Celia began a solo career and Pedro 
        acted as her manager. </p>
      <p>During the '60s she did not receive much recognition, but in the '70s 
        she began recording with fellow legendary salsero, Tito Puente. The success 
        of these albums increased awareness of Caribbean music, which had never 
        been termed &quot;salsa&quot; until this time. It is a very fitting description, 
        however, because as Celia herself once stated, &quot;Salsa means sauce. 
        When you put sauce on meat loaf, or steak, the food tastes better. Salsa 
        is the flavor of my music.&quot; </p>
      <p>On stage, Celia was a very vibrant performer, up until the very end. 
        I saw her in concert two years ago in my hometown in south Texas, and 
        it was everything I imagined it would be and more. True to her reputation, 
        she was wearing a bright orange dress with a bright orange wig and even 
        danced. Her husband Pedro was at her side, as always, directing the band 
        behind her. </p>
      <p>One of Celia's trademarks is the shout of &quot;Azucar!&quot; (Spanish 
        for &quot;sugar&quot;) at every concert. It began with a story she would 
        tell on stage about ordering coffee with sugar at a Miami restaurant. 
        During an interview once, she explained its origin. &quot;I was having 
        dinner at a restaurant in Miami, and when the waiter offered me coffee, 
        he asked me if I took it with or without sugar. I said, 'Chico, you're 
        Cuban. How can you even ask that? With sugar!' And that evening during 
        my show, I told the audience the story and they laughed. And one day, 
        instead of telling the story, I simply walked down the stairs and shouted 
        'Azucar!'&quot; On Cruz's new album, many songs contain this famous trademark, 
        including &quot;Rie y Llora&quot; and &quot;Diagnostico.&quot;</p>
      <p>During her lifetime, Celia received many awards, including a lifetime 
        achievement award from the Smithsonian Institute and honorary doctorate 
        degrees from Yale and the University of Miami. She kept performing and 
        recording up until the very end, with an appearance on a Dr. Pepper commercial 
        which is 2003-09-26ly on the air and the recording of her final, posthumously-released 
        album. </p>
      <p>Celia summed up her vibrant spirit and attitude once when she said, &quot;My 
        life is singing. I don't plan on retiring. I plan to die on a stage. I 
        can have a headache but when it's time to sing and I step on that stage 
        there is no more headache.&quot; May she rest in peace and know that she 
        will always be remembered.<br>
