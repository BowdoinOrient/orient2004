      <p align="left">Of the three Bowdoin men who were crew members on the Nautilus, 
        two were recent graduates: Walter Stone Poor of Fryeburg, Maine, and Simeon 
        Adams Evans, a native of Andover, Massachusetts. During their years at 
        Bowdoin, both men were in the Athenian Society. A year after the Greenland 
        expedition, Poor enlisted with the 10th New York Volunteers and in 1862 
        became first a lieutenant and then a captain with the 1st New York Mounted 
        Rifles. In 1864 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and stationed in 
        the 2nd North Carolina Volunteers. He continued to serve out the rest 
        of the war as a U.S. Provost Marshall in New Berne, North Carolina. After 
        the war he studied law in New York City and later moved to Morristown, 
        New Jersey where he lived until his death in 1906.</p>
      <p>Evans, too, joined the Union Army in 1861, serving as Hospital Steward 
        for the 13th Maine Volunteers and in 1863 as an Assistant Surgeon for 
        the 14th Maine Volunteers. He returned to Brunswick following his service 
        in the war to earn his M.D. at the Medical School of Maine in 1865. He 
        progressed to become a physician in Hopington, New Hampshire, and lived 
        in the nearby town of Conway until his death in 1895. </p>
      <p>However, at the time of the expedition to Greenland, neither Evans or 
        his two Chi Psi fraternity brothers were yet soliders. One of these fraternity 
        brothers was Thomas Worcester Hyde, '61, later a major in the 7th Maine 
        Volunteers and known for his courage at the Battle of Antietam. The other 
        was Samuel Fessenden '61, a staff officer mortally wounded at the Second 
        Battle of Bull Run, in August, 1862. (Thomas W. Hyde and William Pitt 
        Fessenden '23-Sam Fessenden's father, then president of Bowdoin's Alumni 
        Association and United States Senator from Maine-were highlighted in a 
        series written by Kid Wongsrichanalai '03 that appeared in the '01-'02 
        Orient.)</p>
      <p>The other Bowdoin man on the Greenland expedition was a rising senior 
        by the name of Alpheus Spring Packard Jr. Packard was born to true Bowdoin 
        parents; his father was Professor Packard who taught Latin and Greek at 
        Bowdoin from 1824 to 1865, and his mother was Francis Elizabeth Appleton, 
        daughter of former Bowdoin President Jesse Appleton. Alpheus Jr. spent 
        his childhood in Brunswick. (Note: Another of Jesse Appleton's daughters 
        married Franklin Pierce, which means the U.S. President was Alpheus Jr.'s 
        uncle by marriage.) Alpheus Jr. grew up in the Packard wing of the Packard-Smyth 
        House, now the John Brown Russworm House. <br>
        Alpheus's childhood diary provides clues as to how this young man became 
        interested in Natural History, which later led to his Greenland expedition. 
        Alpheus was born with a cleft palate which, though partially corrected 
        by an operation, still affected his speech. Instead of concentrating on 
        his speaking skills, the young boy turned to books. </p>
      <p>At age fifteen, Alpheus, like so many other boys at that time, collected 
        shells, rocks, and other small treasures and curiosities. His Aunt Mary 
        Tucker gave him the bone from a swordfish nose, and Miss Ann Jackson gave 
        him rocks from Mammoth Cave and a chip off Plymouth Rock. Additionally, 
        Miss Jackson let him borrow a book containing illustrations of shells 
        so the young Alpheus could identify the specimens of his collection. He 
        then spread his research to Professor Parker Cleaveland's cabinet and 
        to the local town library. Alpheus made a cabinet to display all his small 
        natural wonders, and his interest in collecting more specimens, identifying 
        them, and learning about them was the first step toward his fascination 
        with natural history and natural science.</p>
      <p>Little did he know that in a few short years, he would be living the 
        dream that he wrote of in his diary in an entry dated Febuary 5, 1856: 
        &quot;I have read a good deal today in my naturalist's library. Oh, that 
        I could wander around the world to collect specimens of Natural History! 
        It seems to me that if I could know all about Botany, Mineralogy, Geology 
        and Conchology and know how to stuff animals and birds, and to preserve 
        insects and keep shells that nothing would be more pleasant provided I 
        had the finances.&quot;<br>
