      <p align="left">On Thursday night, September 18th, Pedro Noguera delivered 
        an interesting and motivating lecture stemming from his most recent book, 
        City Schools and the American Dream. The event was part of the Brodie 
        Family Lecture Series, which was established in 1952 to ensure that speakers 
        would come to Bowdoin to talk about education. Noguera, as Dean Craig 
        McEwen noted in his opening, is a public school activist and a Professor 
        of Communities and Schools at Harvard's Graduate Schools of Education. 
        In the lecture, he provided an outline of the past and present states 
        of American education, while focusing on the criteria he believes the 
        nation must meet in order to better our system.</p>
      <p>Noguera opened the lecture by explaining the deeply-rooted connection 
        between public education and the American Dream. Public schools, he explained, 
        were created to educate children at the public's expense. In this way, 
        Americans sought to ensure that status would not be determined by birthright, 
        as is the case in England. Noguera then stated that public education is 
        &quot;By far, the most democratic institution in our nation,&quot; in 
        that it has come to serve everyone. Furthermore, he noted that while the 
        right to an education is not listed in the Constitution, it is one of 
        the few social entitlements that everyone gets. Though everyone has access 
        to public education, he states that clearly it is &quot;under attack&quot; 
        in today's society, and for many reasons, kids receive unequal educations. 
      </p>
      <p>Noguera then shifted to a discussion of the No Child Left Behind Act 
        (NCLB), passed in 2001, which does not incorporate any plans to help failing 
        schools, but, as he stated, &quot;calls for dismantling the entire system 
        will increase,&quot; as it is virtually impossible for all schools to 
        reach the standards set by this Act. With NCLB, President Bush plans to 
        reach one hundred per cent literacy in schools by 2013. To reach this 
        goal, schools must pass a series of standards; if they fail to meet standards 
        in all categories, including ESL and special education, they will be labeled 
        as &quot;failing&quot; schools. Noguera believes that NCLB avoids the 
        actual problem, and eventually all schools will be deemed &quot;failures.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>We still have hope, though, as Noguera begins to look at what the nation 
        must do in order to improve the situation. Most importantly, he said, 
        &quot;It's not about knowing how to educate kids, it's about willingness 
        to educate kids.&quot; He compared America to Barbados, a very impoverished 
        country that has a ninety-six percent literacy rate and an average score 
        of 1200 on the SAT's. Noguera believes schools such as those in Barbados, 
        that are willing to acknowledge and address their needs, are successful 
        because academic and welfare needs go together. As he stated, &quot;It's 
        hard to read when you can't see, hard to learn when you're hungry, hard 
        to study when you have bad teeth.&quot; </p>
      <p>Noguerahe feels that a key element leading to change is through altering 
        how schools relate to their students and the surrounding community; schools 
        must care about parental satisfaction and see themselves as part of a 
        community rather than as an &quot;island.&quot; Furthermore, he outlines 
        three major points; first, he believes we need moral authority; students 
        should listen to teachers out of genuine respect. Secondly, he believes 
        that we must go beyond the narrow missions of schools and define a school's 
        responsibility as one that is more tied to the students. Lastly, we need 
        to know the needs of our children and build community support and pride 
        through partnerships. <br>
