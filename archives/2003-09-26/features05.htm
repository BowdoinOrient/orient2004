      <p align="left">One of Bowdoin's newest clubs came together this year because 
        students were interested in an academic department that doesn't exist 
        at the College. Under the direction of the energetic Jill Pearlman, a 
        professor in the environmental studies department, the Bowdoin Architecture 
        and Design Club (BAD) will organize events and trips, host speakers, and 
        arrange other activities that will have to do with architecture and urban 
        studies. </p>
      <p>BAD fills a gap in Bowdoin's design offerings by allowing students to 
        explore architecture without fighting to get into a course. &quot;There 
        are too few classes relating to architechture and design,&quot; said Melissa 
        Corey '06. </p>
      <p>The number of students trying to clinch a spot in professor Chris Glass's 
        design class exemplifies this. In recent years, interest has surged. Last 
        spring, 78 students-nearly four times the class cap of 20-listed the course 
        on their application card. Students flooded last year's newly-offered 
        upper level design course as well.</p>
      <p>Career Counselor Tricia Williamson of the Bowdoin Career Planning Center 
        noted student excitement about BAD and the field of architecture in general. 
        &quot;The programs have been well received,&quot; she said. &quot;Students 
        are looking for architectural classes in addition to the visual arts.&quot;</p>
      <p>BAD attendance suggests that she is correct. Thirty people attended the 
        first meeting last spring and interest remains high this year. </p>
      <p>The club hopes to satisfy people who are &quot;looking for architecture 
        to have a bigger place on campus,&quot; said sophomore Ben Smith. He was 
        one of many who mentioned the lack of a major or minor in design, and 
        said he was considering the option to &quot;self-design a major until 
        one is offered by the College.&quot;</p>
      <p>Williamson thinks the club will supplement the Bowdoin curriculum. She 
        hopes it will &quot;educate those interested about what courses to take,&quot; 
        she said.</p>
      <p>For those interested, BAD has a new Architectural Studies website, created 
        by Samantha Farrell and Pearlman. Linked to the environmental studies, 
        art history, and visual arts course pages, the site offers information 
        about architecture and urban studies outside of Bowdoin. Links include 
        study abroad opportunities, summer programs, and the homepages of top 
        graduate schools in the field, as well as research resources and a &quot;building 
        of the week.&quot; </p>
      <p>In recent years, Bowdoin has sent two to three students each summer to 
        Harvard's Career Discovery Program to learn for themselves how to enter 
        the field. Recommended for those interested in a career in design, the 
        six-week intensive program educates students about a life in these professions 
        by immersing them into individually tutored studio sessions, lectures 
        by professionals, workshops, and field trips.</p>
      <p>However, before students trek to Cambridge next summer, BAD will address 
        the curiosity that so many students seem to have here. Starting this Sunday 
        with Rob Rothblatt, a series of speakers will visit the campus to discuss 
        architecture, urban planning, and other interests.</p>
      <p>Rothblatt, a senior designer at Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, will answer 
        student's questions about architecture, his job at SOM, the profession 
        in general, and how to pursue it as a career from Bowdoin. He will present 
        &quot;So You Want to Be an Architect?&quot; on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. in 
        Adams Hall.</p>
      <p>On Monday, November 10, BAD will bring Bowdoin alumnus Ethan Kent, from 
        the Project for Public Spaces in New York, to campus. His program works 
        in neighborhoods to create spaces in which a community can come together.</p>
      <p>The following Friday, November 14, BAD will host a charette, during which 
        teams of students and faculty will compete to create the best new hypothetical 
        design for a welcoming public space on the vacant Dudley Coe quad.</p>
      <p>Freeman Lecturer Peter Rowe, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design, 
        will discuss modern architecture in China later in November. Also during 
        that month, Roche-Dinkeloo architect Garry Leonard will speak to students 
        about his firm's work, which includes the recent masterplan for the Metropolitan 
        Museum of Art as well as the Oakland Museum.</p>
      <p>If you would like to join BAD or participate in the charette, contact 
        Nicole Goyette (ngoyette). If you would like more information on architecture 
        or urban design at Bowdoin, contact Jill Pearlman (jpearlm).</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more information on BAD events to come!<br>
