      <p align="left"><font size="5">Overreaction to new keg policy</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors,</p>
      <p align="left">I'm writing to clarify some aspects of last week's article 
        about Howell House and Inter-House Council (IHC) policy. The IHC has never 
        allowed Howell to register kegs, nor does it have the power to grant that 
        ability. The college houses are allowed to register six of the ten kegs 
        permitted on campus each weekend night. The new policy reported last week 
        is simply a formalization of the common IHC practice of spreading out 
        parties between houses as we have always done in past years. The kegs 
        that the other five houses are not registering on the nights of Howell 
        events are still available to the general campus, just as on any other 
        night when the college houses register fewer than six kegs. In fact, last 
        Friday not one of the ten kegs available to the whole campus was requested 
        for.</p>
      <p align="left">I think the displeasure this policy created is, in general, 
        an overreaction resulting from misinformation. Our keg distribution policy 
        is an internal procedural matter and, in practice, has not changed from 
        previous years. Not having an alcoholic campus wide party at another house 
        on a night that Howell has a party is not a guarantee of great time at 
        Howell, however, it is certainly not a guarantee that other houses will 
        lose out. If the issues of alcohol or other programs at College Houses 
        are of great concern to you, feel free to bring it up with your affiliate 
        house.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Editors, </p>
      <p>This is in response to Pat Rockefeller's column last week, &quot;Cali-freakin'-fornia 
        in shambles.&quot; After the 2000 presidential election effectively cost 
        most rational Americans their faith in others' ability to remove their 
        own hanging chads, the California secretary of state decertified the use 
        of punch-card machines, effective March 2004. Six counties - Los Angeles, 
        Santa Clara, San Diego, Sacramento, Mendocino and Solano - have yet to 
        replace their voting machines with more user-friendly technology. </p>
      <p>It is true that the California constitution does mandate that recall 
        elections occur within 80 days of obtaining the specified number of signatures. 
        However, when we re-elected Gray Davis in November, no one could anticipate 
        the need for new voting machines prior to the March deadline. Knowing 
        that punch-card machines carry a margin of counting error 2.5 times that 
        of other machines, and having learned from the mistakes of Florida in 
        the last presidential election, can we in good conscience condone the 
        disenfranchisement of an estimated 40,000 people when there is still time 
        to do something about it? </p>
      <p>There is an argument, I think a pretty good one, that anyone who is not 
        responsible enough to remove chads from a ballot probably shouldn't be 
        voting in the first place. After all, voting machines, even the new ones, 
        are only more user-friendly, not idiot-proof. However, as a registered 
        voter of Los Angeles County, I'm personally grateful that the 9th Circuit 
        believes in the basic democratic principle that all of us, even Cali-freakin'-fornians, 
        have the right not only to vote, but to have that vote count. </p>
      <p>When you live in the country's second-largest metro area, and your little 
        neighborhood by itself has 200,000 people, you already feel enough like 
        a number. The fact that any one of us can run for governor as long as 
        we have $3,500 and 65 friends, or $0 but 10,000 friends, is the best possible 
        argument that democracy is, in fact, alive and well in California. So 
        maybe it's only the wahoos who come out of the woodwork at a time like 
        this - porn stars, washed-up child actors, a former Mr. Universe. The 
        rest of us have jobs and lives and absolutely no interest in balancing 
        the world's fifth-largest economy. However, rather than proclaiming California 
        to be in shambles, think about how rare it is, how special it is, that 
        so many people from so many walks of life can come forward and say, I 
        may be but one lowly person out of 35,000,000, but I have something to 
        say, and you're going to hear me, even if I have to threaten you with 
        my uzi or, worse, images of me engaged in group sex. </p>
      <p>And please, before you start comparing us to that southeastern peninsula 
        who shall remain nameless, kindly remember one thing: we haven't had our 
        election yet, so wait until the votes are counted before you declare it 
        botched. We don't yet have a governator, and if we ever do, by all means 
        commence the earthquakes and mercifully wipe our sorry selves from the 
        face of the earth. However, not before you burst that Bowdoin Bubble of 
        yours and realize a few things, like politics is a lot more complicated 
        than Potholm's mock elections and a freak earthquake is all fun and games 
        until the next presidential election, when you again start coveting what, 
        in 2004, will be 55 very pissed electoral votes. </p>
