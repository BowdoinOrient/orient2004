        <font size="2">PRIYA SRIDHAR<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">While most Bowdoin students' personal connection to the 
        war in Iraq is minimal, Alex Cornell du Houx '06 has taken a semester 
        off from Bowdoin after he was called to active duty by the Marines. Three 
        days after his first year at Bowdoin, Cornell flew to South Carolina to 
        participate in 13 weeks of boot camp and recruit training. </p>
      <p>Upon completion of the boot camp, Cornell received another surprise, 
        he had been called to go to Camp Legune in North Carolina to attend the 
        School of Infantry. All residents of Maine who join the Marine Corps are 
        automatically assigned to infantry because of Maine's contribution to 
        the total marines. Cornell expects to be back at Bowdoin by January, but 
        in the meantime his life will be drastically different from those of his 
        fellow students.</p>
      <p>Everyday Cornell wakes up between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. and eats a 
        &quot;meal, ready to eat.&quot; He then goes to the fields, where the 
        Marines cover a specific topic that changes weekly. </p>
      <p>This week, Cornell finished learning about platoon formations and patrolling. 
        Next week, he will explore the various aspects of land navigation. </p>
      <p>Often, the rigor of a day in the field is not enough for Marines, and 
        they will finish the day with a ten-mile nature walk in which they must 
        carry their 80-pound packs on their backs.</p>
      <p>Each day spent in the field is followed by an eight-hour day in the classroom 
        where the Marines learn everything from first aid to weapontry. </p>
      <p>&quot;The academics are not easy,&quot; Cornell said. He pointed to the 
        fact that one-third of the class failed the last examination. </p>
      <p>Every Marine has a specific specialization. Cornell's job concentrates 
        on rocket launchers and assault. If called to battle, he will have to 
        work with explosives to target tanks. In North Carolina, Cornell will 
        spend eight weeks mastering his job. </p>
      <p>Cornell understands that his job as a Marine is to protect and serve 
        the United States, and he tries not to let his own political opinions 
        get in the way of his responsibilities. </p>
      <p>&quot;I disagree with the way we went into Iraq,&quot; Cornell said. 
        He thinks that if the US had tried to form more alliances before going 
        in, there would not have been as many lives lost.&quot; </p>
      <p>&quot;My job, as a marine, is to go when they call me. I do my job 100 
        percent no matter what,&quot; he said. About one-third of the platoon 
        is college students and Cornell considers himself in the minority when 
        it comes criticizing the Iraq policy.</p>
      <p>Cornell wanted to be part of the Army, Navy, or Marines since he was 
        a child. His parents were not at all surprised at his fascination with 
        the Marines. He was always very athletic and involved with politics. </p>
      <p>Ramona Cornell du Houx, Alex's mother, said, &quot;We support Alex in 
        all his endeavors. I am worried about Alex's safety, as a mother should 
        be, but I know the Marines are the best trained force that we have. So 
        they and Alex, know what they are doing.&quot; </p>
      <p>The ROTC programs interested Cornell, but Bowdoin was his first priority 
        and being in the ROTC would require Cornell to find transportation to 
        Orono. Cornell considers the Marines the most challenging branch and thinks 
        it will get him in the best shape if he is ever in the position to go 
        into combat. Because there is a Marine base in Thompson, Maine, the branch 
        was also relatively easy to be involved with while attending Bowdoin. 
      </p>
      <p>After calling a recruiter in California, Cornell headed to Portland for 
        a series of intense physical screenings. He is now on a six-by-two-year 
        contract that helps with his college payments. His contract calls for 
        him to be a reservist for six years, which requires one weekend a month 
        and two weeks a year. </p>
      <p>During the required weekends, the Marines drill, train, and practice 
        in the rifle range. The two weeks a year are spent learning more specific 
        war tactics like urban warfare and scuba diving. </p>
      <p>&quot;The stuff we learn here, you can't learn anywhere else. It's an 
        amazing experience,&quot; Cornell said. </p>
      <p>After six years in the Reserves, Cornell must spend two years on call. 
        Although he's not sure exactly what he wants to do with his future, he 
        is considering spending a couple of extra years with the Marines and could 
        be promoted to second lieutenant soon after his contract ends. </p>
      <p>At Bowdoin, Cornell was involved in numerous extracurricular activities. 
        He was part of the Bowdoin Democrats and the Maine State Democrats. As 
        a first year, he was the head of the Baxter Buddy Tutoring Program and 
        Habitat for Humanity. He is also very involved in Bowdoin's track team 
        and Outing Club.</p>
      <p>Cornell is leaning towards a government major and thinks he will be able 
        to use the skills and values he learns from his experience in the Marines 
        later in life. Cornell says that he isn't really scared about being called 
        to go abroad because he is confident that he'll do his assignment well 
        after the training he has been given. &quot;I miss Bowdoin, though,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;I'd like to get back as soon as possible.&quot;<br>
