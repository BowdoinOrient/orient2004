      <p align="left"> This past Wednesday evening, Residential Life sponsored 
        a pizza-eating contest in Smith Union. The event was co-sponsored by Papa 
        Johns, one of the two most prominent pizza-vending facilities in the Bowdoin 
        community. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Papa Johns had three major executives at the event to vouch 
        for the company and run the competition. There was also a dancing pizza, 
        who mysteriously refused to be interviewed by the Orient and traveled 
        around the union during the competition, causing the competitors to add 
        pizza to their list of fears, right after clowns. <br>
      </p>

      </table>With a donation of over 90 pizzas, it seemed that Papa Johns 
        made a strong case to the Bowdoin community that they are there to serve 
        students. All of the money that was raised in donations and in pizza sales 
        are being given to the Tedford Shelter, a local homeless shelter. <br>
      <p align="left">The contest consisted of 90 students and 90 pizzas. The 
        teams were in groups of three, and in order to win, all three members 
        of the team had to finish their entire pizza first (note: one pizza equals 
        approximately eight slices) and stand up when finished. In addition to 
        all of the competitors, an impressive 100 or so bystanders crowded into 
        Smith Union to watch the grueling competition. The competitors ranged 
        from huge 6'7&quot; football players to tiny 5'4&quot; freshmen. As one 
        individual pointed out, &quot;You have to have a big brain to win, not 
        a big stomach.&quot; The results showed that while many Bowdoin students 
        get enough practice using their brains, their stomachs had a harder time 
        dealing with such pressure. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last year, Res Life put together a donut-eating contest 
        that did not get as much publicity, but was still an entertaining event-especially 
        due to two individuals who began the contest by piling the donuts into 
        a bag and running out of the Union like renegades. This contest had costumed 
        individuals and students who ate with forks and knives and matching napkins. 
        It was quite a sight, complete with students who turned green after the 
        competition and needed assistance exiting the union.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There were some very interesting strategies among the competitors. 
        Some soaked their whole pizzas in water and sucked them down their throats 
        in massive dollops, some took all the cheese off first, and some left 
        the crust to the end and then stuffed them down their throat. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many of these people finished their pies, but none of them 
        won. For many, it was a battle of self-determination and personal goals. 
        It is safe to say that Bowdoin students are very motivated and try to 
        challenge themselves in all of their endeavors. Pizza-eating and hurling 
        are no exceptions. Many left the competition hungry; others will not touch 
        a pizza for the next two months.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The winning prizes were cash, and those that came in first 
        place were also given a free pizza a month by Papa Johns for the rest 
        of the school year. First place went to Jesse Minneman, Tom Bresnehan, 
        and Nick LaRocque. Dan Jaffe, Tim Cashman, and Dan Campbell all received 
        second place, and third place went to Jarrett Young, Greg Berry, and Brandon 
        Casten. Congratulations to all of the winners. You are role models to 
        all of us.<br>
        The question remains: did anyone hurl? Last year, the audience was disappointed 
        to find competitors with strong stomachs. This year, the audience was 
        not disappointed, and many of those who did not win flooded into the bathrooms 
        afterwards to be sick. For the bystanders, Papa Johns sold pizza for $1 
        per slice. When the crowds started to disappear, free pizzas were tossed 
        out to students. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was a very entertaining event that certainly brought 
        the campus together. It makes one realize what college is really all about: 
        live life to the fullest and then vomit it right back up again, Animal 
        House-style.<br>
