      <p align="left"><font size="5">The fundamental source of tension<br></font>
        <font size="2">YARON EISENBERG<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Recent events in Israel have triggered a whirlwind of speculations 
        and prophecies. Such sweeping predictions have often included talks of 
        an Islamic fundamentalist outcry or of another Arab-Israeli War. Although 
        such prospects are not out of the question, the explanations given to 
        analyze the present crisis in the Middle East occasionally overlook key 
        issues, which are at the heart of the Arab-Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. 
        These topics include the historical and continuing tradition of rejecting 
        Israel as a Jewish state, as well as anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>One can hold any number of opinions on this topic, but the indisputable 
        fact remains that the Arab and Islamic World, the leaders and the Western 
        media's beloved 'Arab Street', have never accepted Israel's right to exist 
        as a Jewish state. Remember the infamous comments made by former Iranian 
        leader Rafsanjani regarding the destruction of Israel by nuclear means.</p>
      <p>The Arab leaders rejected the U.N. partition plan. It was a united Arab 
        front that initiated the 1948 war and promised their Palestinian 'brothers' 
        a short, sweet victory. There have been many subsequent wars, all of which 
        endangered Israel's security and survival. The Six Days War '67, The Yom 
        Kippur War '73, the Al-Aqsa Intifada, all of which started with the same 
        rally cries calling for the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews 
        and concluded with the same stalemate that has plagued the region for 
        the past fifty-five years: Israel's survival and the Arab and Muslim states 
        seeking to terminate that survival. </p>
      <p>One cannot deny the anti-Semitic attitudes that are not only entrenched 
        in Middle Eastern society today, but also are seeping through the pores 
        of government. The breed of anti-Semitism seen in the Middle East and 
        elsewhere, taught in religious institutions such as schools and mosques, 
        universities, state-run television, internet websites, newspapers, and 
        other mediums, is taken straight from a Nazi playbook. Peer at most Arabic 
        newspapers and you'll see that the political cartoons are not just reminiscent, 
        but frighteningly similar to those appearing in Nazi propaganda pieces.</p>
      <p>For instance, a political cartoon in the April 16, 2003 issue of Al-Watan, 
        a Qatar newspaper, portrays a Jew in a classic anti-Semitic, Naziesque 
        fashion. Note the hard to miss Star of David, nose, beard, stereotypical 
        clothing, a demonic grin, satanic eyes, and hovering over world leaders 
        as if he is in control of world policy; classical Jewish conspiracy theory.</p>
      <p>Anti-Semitism in the Middle East should not come to anybody's surprise 
        considering the fact that one of the leaders in the thirties and forties 
        claiming to champion the Palestinian cause, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem 
        Hajj Amin al-Husayni, was indeed a staunch ally of Nazi Germany, as were 
        other notable Arab leaders.</p>
      <p>Renowned Middle East/Islamic scholar Bernard Lewis from Princeton Univerisity 
        writes in his important book Semites and Anti-Semites, &quot;His (al-Husayni) 
        objectives as he explained on numerous occasions to German officials, 
        were far-reaching. His immediate aim was to halt and terminate Jewish 
        settlement in Palestine. Beyond that, however, he aimed at much vaster 
        purposes, conceived not so much in pan-Arab as in pan-Islamic terms, for 
        a Holy War of Islam in alliance with Germany against world Jewry, to accomplish 
        the final solution of the Jewish problem everywhere.&quot; </p>
      <p>A more modern example draws one to a sermon delivered in a Gaza mosque, 
        which was broadcasted on PA television on Friday, August 3, 2001. Sheik 
        Ibrahim Madhi said, &quot;All spears should be directed at the Jews, at 
        the enemies of Allah, the nation that was cursed in Allah's book. Allah 
        has described them as apes and pigs, the calf-worshipers, idol-worshipers.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Egypt, a nation Israel has a 'peace treaty' with, ran a Saudi Arabian 
        production on television of a dramatization of The Elders of the Protocol 
        Zion, a work which has proven to be false and epitomizes anti-Semitic 
        sentiment and literature. There are endless examples. I will offer one 
        more. Dr. Umayma Ahmad Al-Jalahma, in the Saudi newspaper Al-Riyadh, wrote 
        about Purim, &quot;For this holiday, the Jewish people must obtain human 
        blood so that their clerics can prepare the holiday pastries. In other 
        words, the practice cannot be carried out as required if human blood is 
        not spilled!!&quot;</p>
      <p>The crux of the problem in the Middle East neither begins with the Palestinian-Israeli 
        issue, nor ends with the solution to that problem. The source of the tension 
        runs deeper and thicker. Israel and its place in the Middle East is a 
        complex and multi-layered matrix. However, the intricate knots cannot 
        be untied unless there is a general acceptance - a genuine and sincere 
        acceptance - of Israel existing as a Jewish, democratic state in the Middle 
        East along with a reduction of the level of anti-Semitism.<br>
