        <font size="2">ELLIOT JACOBS<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Your raft approaches Big Poppler, the biggest drop on the 
        Dead River. Water is pouring over the sides of the boat and you struggle 
        to hear your raft guide as he shouts commands to you. &quot;All forward!&quot; 
        he yells as you approach the drop. Fortunately, you aren't in any real 
        danger because your raft guide is none other than Jeremy Katzen, an upstanding 
        member of the Bowdoin Outing Club (BOC). </p>
      <p>Rafting is one of the biggest adrenaline sports that the BOC sponsors. 
        Led by fellow students, you put on your wetsuit, PFD (personal floatation 
        device), and helmet to blast through whitewater up to Class IV. The water 
        is huge and the thrills are intense. </p>
      <p>If that interests you, sign up for this weekend's rafting trip. Past 
        trips to the Dead have proved that it is one of the best rivers to raft 
        in the Northeast. There are huge standing waves, big drops, and sections 
        of calm water to chill out in between. </p>
      <p>Enrollment in whitewater trips is pretty limited, but if you can't get 
        out this weekend, never fear, because the BOC leads a number of rafting 
        trips throughout the fall and the spring. You'll definitely get a chance 
        to get out on the water this year! </p>
      <p>In the meantime, sign up for a different kind of outing-one that only 
        comes around once a year. Common Good Day trips, which will take place 
        next Saturday, October 4, mark a day when Bowdoin students and faculty 
        join together to do their part for the Brunswick community. Even the adrenaline 
        high of white-water rafting can't match the good feeling you get knowing 
        that you provided a service to those in need. Plus, you get a free shirt.</p>
      <p>These popular trips are filling up fast and the last day to sign up is 
        tomorrow! If mulching or bike path maintenance in Brunswick appeals to 
        you, or if cabin deconstruction in Georgetown or trail maintenance in 
        Rockport sound interesting, be sure to sign up. In all seriousness, we 
        spend a lot of our years here enjoying the beautiful state of Maine, so 
        give something back next weekend.</p>
      <p>You can recover from your day of do-gooding with a great BOC trip. On 
        Sunday, Alex Harris and Carly Smith (who are both tall and blond) are 
        leading an awesome sea kayaking day trip. They plan to cruise from Bethel 
        Point around Yarmouth Island, stopping around noon to relax in the sun 
        and grab some lunch. There isn't a more mellow way to spend a Sunday. 
      </p>
      <p>Also that day, BOC superstars Dan Abraham and Elliot Jacobs (the ambiguously 
        gay duo) will lead a flatwater canoe trip to an undisclosed location. 
        The trip will surely fill up fast, especially with the female first years, 
        so sign up soon.</p>
      <p>In other big news, McKay Jenkins, author of The White Death, is set to 
        speak at Bowdoin on October 2. His latest book, The Last Ridge, is the 
        story of the Army's 10th Mountain Division and its part in assaulting 
        Hitler's Europe. The division was comprised of the best skiers, climbers, 
        and outdoorsmen in the United States, and they helped turn the tide of 
        the war for the Allies. Jenkins's book is fantastic and he is an awesome 
        speaker, so you won't want to miss this event (at 7:30 pm in the Outdoor 
        Leadership Center).</p>
      <p>Let's recap: 1. Sign up for service trips by tomorrow; 2. Rafting is 
        fun; 3. Don't miss McKay Jenkins.</p>
      <p>Finally, even though I am well over the article length that the Orient 
        editors tolerate from me, I would like to introduce a new portion of my 
        weekly column: brief yet infinitely wise tidbits of advice for first-years.</p>
      <p>I see many of you walking around these days with your ID card around 
        your neck on the little string-holder-thing. My advice: Get a clue, freshmen! 
        It's not like we're all assistant scientists at a biomedical facility. 
        We know you go here. We could tell by your J.Crew casuals. You use that 
        stupid thing approximately seven times a day, which corresponds almost 
        exactly to the number of times men pee in any given day. We don't keep 
        that equipment out for convenience. </p>
      <p>In sum, keep your card in your pants and your head on your shoulders. 
        And sign up for trips!<br>
      </p>
