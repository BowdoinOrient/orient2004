      <p align="left"> With the beginning of another semester comes the usual 
        pained expressions around campus, the result of the usual personal ills: 
        the pain of gaining weight at unprecedented speed, the pain of being that 
        kid who lost his jacket and has to send an email to the digest (don't 
        be that kid), and the pain of realizing that your mind still isn't what 
        it didn't used to be. Above all of these ills, however, is the pain of 
        being a pre-med and having to make that long trudge to Searles 315 to 
        do your time in introductory physics.</p>
      <p>At least it's worth it. I am not a pre-med, but as the son of a son of 
        a doctor and someone whose name starts with a vowel, I feel uniquely qualified 
        to make fun of pre-meds in public documents. Let me offer the story of 
        my most recent visit to my doctor. I hadn't been to the doctor in quite 
        a while, and though I didn't feel that anything was seriously wrong with 
        me, I wanted to get some minor things checked out. I'll admit, for example, 
        that sometimes I feel like my chi-squared is a little, well, small. More 
        than one standard deviation from the mean, if you will. I had this dark 
        hairy spot on my back, which I feared was a developing black hole. I had 
        also been having problems with other aspects of my life. I felt that whenever 
        someone acted on me I would react upon them, almost equally so. Sooo, 
        I thought it was time to visit my doctor.</p>
      <p>Golly, I'm glad I went in for a check-up. After a little small talk and 
        the usual assortment of tests (weight, height, water-displacement, Planar 
        Tunneling Spectroscopy, etc.), the door closed and the check-up proper 
        began. You know, once the exam room door closes, a doctor becomes a real 
        craftsman: one-on-one with your doc, the gloves come off (not really - 
        this is when they snap on) and you have the chance to see a real physician 
        at work. On command, I turned around and showed him my suspicious black 
        hole. After just a moment of inspection, my doctor informed me that there 
        was no need to worry about it; black holes have no hair. Whatever heinous 
        thing was on my back was just some gross icky thing. With hair. Next, 
        he examined my chi-squared while I turned my head and coughed. When I 
        raised the issue of my action/reaction behavior, he informed me that such 
        behavior was pretty fundamental. We talked about how I feel uncertainty: 
        sometimes I act like I'm one thing, and other times I act like I'm something 
        else altogether. He prescribed a Fourier analysis, signed some forms with 
        what looked like a force diagram of a rope-and-pulley, and sent me on 
        my way. All in all, I would say I left feeling in peak physical condition.</p>
      <p>Without an intimate knowledge of physics a doctor could do nothing. I 
        mean, what do you talk to your doctor about?</p>
      <p>What I don't understand is what all you pre-meds spend your time doing 
        besides physics. Moan and groan all you want, physics sure is better than 
        other subjects. At least it's not a social science: social sciences, like 
        tattoos, are mistakes that scar you for life. Any run-in with these is 
        usually the result of a bet gone awry or peer pressure from a friend who 
        has had one too many.</p>
      <p>So remember how important introductory physics is to your future the 
        next time you sit down at eleven-thirty on a Tuesday night with that problem 
        set still crisp and untouched (indeed even slightly dusty from a week 
        of rest under your bed). As you do your multiplications and derivations, 
        your integrations and dividerations, think: I am learning the skills I 
        will use every day in my profession. The next time you sit in class attempting 
        not to make contact with the glass-rimmed eyes of your physics professor 
        - because a physics professor not wearing glasses is a physics professor 
        who has misplaced his glasses - remember: it's worth it.<br>
