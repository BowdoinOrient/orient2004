        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        DUDLEY COE HEALTH CENTER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: I didn't get vaccinated for meningitis this 
        summer. Should I get vaccinated now? -M.J.</p>
      <p align="left">Dear M.J.: Like most issues in medicine, this one is less 
        than black and white. First, let's go over the facts as I understand them.</p>
      <p>Meningitis is an infection of the central nervous system (brain and spinal 
        cord), caused most often by viruses but also by bacteria and other pathogens. 
        The &quot;meningitis vaccine&quot; is meant for meningococcal meningitis, 
        which is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitides. Meningococcal 
        meningitis usually begins as a vague, flu-like illness, and can progress 
        extremely rapidly, with the development of headache, fever, stiff neck, 
        and vomiting. A characteristic rash appears late but usually just prior 
        to collapse and coma. If treated promptly, meningococcal meningitis is 
        highly curable. Untreated, it is likely fatal.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, meningococcal meningitis is quite rare. There are about 
        3,000 sporadic cases per year in this country. Between 100 and 125 of 
        them occur on college campuses. The case fatality rate is about 10 percent. 
        That means that nationwide, about 10 to12 college students are likely 
        to die each year of meningococcal meningitis. There has not yet been a 
        case on a Maine college campus.</p>
      <p>The natural reservoir of meningococcus is the back of our throats. In 
        fact, Neisseriae can be cultured from up to 15 percent of randomly selected 
        healthy individuals. These &quot;asymptomatic carriers&quot; do not themselves 
        develop meningitis. They may spread the bacteria by sneezing or coughing, 
        however, and others may be more susceptible. </p>
      <p>Carriage rates rise to 40 percent among close contacts of people with 
        active meningitis. During a meningitis outbreak, the carriage rate in 
        &quot;closed populations&quot; like college dormitories or military barracks 
        are likely to be higher still-up to 75 percent. </p>
      <p>Vaccination does not prevent people from carrying the bacteria. Carriers 
        can be treated with antibiotics and cleared of Neisseria, at least temporarily. 
        That's the reason for treating all close contacts of people with active 
        meningitis. The same rationale underlies treating all residents of dormitories 
        and barracks during a meningococcal outbreak. </p>
      <p>So, why not test everyone and treat all carriers before there's an outbreak? 
      </p>
      <p>Remember that meningococcal meningitis is rare. The risk of disease among 
        first-year college students in residence is about 1 in 300,000. For purposes 
        of comparison, that's about three times more likely than your lifetime 
        risk of being struck by lightning. </p>
      <p>From a public health point of view, it makes little sense to test 100 
        percent of a population then treat up to 15 percent in order to prevent 
        an illness that will affect only 0.00033 percent. Plus, you never know 
        when you might become a carrier, or for how long.</p>
      <p>What about requiring the vaccine? There are five serotypes of Neisseria 
        bacteria that cause meningitis. The vaccine is about 90 percent protective 
        against four of them. These four serotypes collectively cause about 65 
        percent of meningococcal meningitis cases. Therefore, if everyone in the 
        country received the vaccine, about 60 percent of meningococcal meningitis 
        cases could be prevented.</p>
      <p>The vaccine has almost no significant side effects or risks, and its 
        protective effects last three to four years. It is expensive, and it is 
        2003-09-26ly manufactured under patent by one company and being aggressively 
        marketed by that company to doctors and college health centers.</p>
      <p>The federal Centers for Disease Control have made the following calculation. 
        Vaccination of all first-year college students might prevent 37 to 69 
        cases of disease, and two to four deaths each year. The cost per case 
        prevented would be about $3 million, and the cost per death prevented 
        about $48 million. That's many, many orders of magnitude more expensive 
        than any other public health intervention.</p>
      <p>The Health Center's cost for a vaccine, on the other hand, is $59, and 
        that's what you will pay if you choose to be vaccinated here. </p>
      <p>To return to your original question: should you get vaccinated against 
        meningococcal meningitis? The only &quot;down sides&quot; to the vaccine 
        are the cost and a mildly sore arm. On the &quot;upside,&quot; you'll 
        be protected against four of the five serotypes of Neisseria for a few 
        years, and so reduce your risk of infection by well over 50 percent. That 
        is a significant reduction. </p>
      <p>One final caveat. In the event of an actual case of meningococcal meningitis 
        on campus, all close contacts would need to take antibiotics whether or 
        not they had been vaccinated. The serotype of the infecting Neisseria 
        would take days to determine, but antibiotics are immediately effective 
        against all five strains of meningococcus.</p>
      <p>All of us at the Health Center would be happy to discuss any questions 
        or concerns you may have. The final decisions, of course, are yours.</p>
