      <p>I recently read somewhere that Radiohead is now the most bootlegged band 
        in history. How one calculates that I don't know, but the claim makes 
        sense. Their fans are obsessive (myself case in point), and Radiohead 
        is, quite simply, the best live act in rock. If you disagree, chances 
        are you haven't seen them.<br>
        Ironically, the thing that makes them so good in concert is the intense, 
        frenetic energy that has been missing from their two recent albums, Amnesiac 
        and Kid A. Both have been showcases of the band's experiments in an electronic 
        rock that sometimes falls into the category of ambient.<br>

      <p>Understandably, this summer my friends and I were anxious to discover 
        how the band's live persona had changed since we saw them on their <i>Ok, 
        Computer</i> tour almost three years before. As soon as the 30,000 fans 
        and I gathered, we heard the distorted bass that drives the chaotic &quot;National 
        Anthem;&quot; however, any fears were dispelled as the same energy that 
        underscores all the band's performances was pumped into a ravenous crowd. 
        It would not let up until the 3 hour set was over.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Fortunately for fans who have yet to catch Radiohead in concert, the 
        band's live feel has been captured amazingly well on their most recent 
        release, an EP entitled <i>I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings</i>. The 
        EP, released to promote the band's third single off of Amnesiac, contains 
        more delights than I would have thought possible in an only 8 track live 
        release. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Several tracks, for example, appear in a completely different form than 
        they do on studio albums. On &quot;Everything in its Right Place,&quot; 
        Yorke's voice is looped and then twisted and distorted over seven minutes 
        of driving keyboard and bass . &quot;Like Spinning Plates,&quot; which 
        on Amnesiac is an unrecognizable mix of vaguely discernable sounds, it 
        appears here as nothing but stripped piano and singer Thom Yorke's elegiacal 
        voice.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The EP also marks the first official release of the oft-bootlegged &quot;True 
        Love Waits,&quot; perhaps Radiohead's single most beautiful effort. Over 
        simple acoustic guitar, Yorke's sounds pained as he pleads &quot;Just 
        don't leave, don't leave&quot;--something, of course, no one in the audience 
        would dream of doing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is Yorke's voice, in fact, that makes <i>I Might Be Wrong</i> so special. 
        Played down on the two recent releases, this EP's raw sound highlights 
        the way it takes on a life of its own in concert. Just listen as it howls 
        and snarls its way through &quot;National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Idioteque.&quot; 
        It then becomes a haunting mumble through &quot;Dollars and Cents.&quot; 
        In short, it sounds more powerful and versatile than on any Radiohead 
        release, except <i>The Bends</i>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In sharp contrast, another new Radiohead-related release, <i>Strung Out 
        on OK, Computer: A String Quartet Tribute to Radiohead</i>, is anything 
        but powerful.Strung Out is comprised of Eric Gorfain's arrangements of 
        the 12 tracks on <i>Ok, Computer</i>, the band's third release. Although 
        it is a novel idea and has a few striking moments, by the end of &quot;Airbag&quot; 
        the album already feels tired and monotonous. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Often, the disc sounds contrived and borders on the ridiculous--take 
        the replacement of distorted guitar on &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; by 
        staccato violin for example. At other times, as on &quot;Karma Police,&quot; 
        the melodies are lost in the swirling, but not all that sophisticated, 
        string arrangements. In the end (if you make it that far), <i>Strung Out</i> 
        seems lifeless and muddled; the antithesis of <i>Ok, Computer</i> <br>
      </p>
      <p>What Gorfain perhaps fails to realize is the very thing made so plain 
        by <i>I Might Be Wrong</i>--after the distortion, the melodies, and the 
        complicated rhythms, it is the sound of Yorke's voice that makes a Radiohead 
        song a Radiohead song in the end. </p>
      <p>I Might Be Wrong: 4/4<br>
        Strung Out: 1.5/4</p>
