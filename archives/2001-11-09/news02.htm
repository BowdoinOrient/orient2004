        It isn't every day that a former White House Fellow or Pulitzer Prize-winner 
        visits the Bowdoin campus. Students, faculty, and community members flocked 
        to the unique opportunity to hear historian Doris Kearns Goodwin speak 
        at last Friday's Common Hour.<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">Peppered with anecdotes that drew laughs from a packed Pickard 
        Theater, Goodwin's talk revolved around her research on several different 
        presidents and her love of baseball. She described her passion for history 
        as a &quot;curiously intertwined&quot; one that grew out of her father's 
        influence and mother's terminal illness. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodwin said that she had little choice in loving baseball 
        with her father in the house. With an early introduction to the sport, 
        she is an expert on the game. &quot;It has allowed me to cycle back to 
        my childhood,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After suffering a long-term illness, Goodwin's mother died 
        when she was 15 years old, leaving a legacy behind with her daughter. 
        &quot;She would tell me stories...I figured that if I could keep her talking, 
        this premature aging process could be stopped in its tracks,&quot; Goodwin 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a result, Goodwin said that she realized the importance 
        of a continued oral tradition within families. &quot;Legacies can be passed 
        on if we pledge to retell their stories,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She also learned an effective method of gathering information 
        as a result. When interviewing the children of famous people for research, 
        Goodwin said that asking them to relate stories of their own childhoods 
        revealed much about their parents.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Moving to the topic of her experience with historical research, 
        Goodwin spoke most about her interactions with Lyndon Johnson, under whom 
        she worked in the White House. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Calling him &quot;the best storyteller I've ever encountered 
        in all my life,&quot; Goodwin told colorful anecdotes of Johnson's many 
        tall tales. She drew laughs from the audience when relating Johnson's 
        comment that &quot;These journalists, they're such sticklers for detail!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodwin provided insight into her own views of Johnson, 
        a man whom she said was &quot;roundly defeated by the [Vietnam] war.&quot; 
        She inferred that its mission &quot;had to be right&quot; in his mind 
        to have cost 50,000 lives.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She mentioned that, later in his life, Johnson seemed to 
        understand his administration's mistakes in the handling of the war. She 
        said that his credibility was &quot;devastatingly destroyed&quot; by that 
        point-a destruction that led to his withdrawal from politics and exile 
        on the ranch, which she often visited.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodwin listed some of the important achievements that she 
        gathered from studying Johnson's presidency, citing the end of segregation 
        as a major turning point in United States history. It was an &quot;incredibly 
        risky&quot; move, she said, one that &quot;forever changed the face of 
        our country.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Transitioning to the work that earned her the Pulitzer, 
        Goodwin spoke of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She likened the circumstances of their administration to 
        America's current situation, saying that they were &quot;relevant because 
        FDR led us through two of the greatest crises of this century-the Great 
        Depression and World War II.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Roosevelts &quot;were leaders in the [struggle] with 
        the strongest force against Western society ever,&quot; she said. &quot;FDR 
        made people strong enough to withstand [the events], even when facing 
        seemingly insurmountable challenges.&quot;<br>
        The most important things that a leader can do, according to Goodwin, 
        are to &quot;make people feel connected to the other people in the country...[and] 
        make them feel they can do something, a sense of participation.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She compared the Axis powers' blitz of London to the recent 
        attacks on New York City. Goodwin called the antagonists' aim to break 
        public spirit a failure, and made reference to the Londoners' resilience 
        in surviving an 18-month onslaught.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Eleanor Roosevelt's influence on her husband's presidency 
        was a large part of the history Goodwin investigated. &quot;There is no 
        greater First Lady than Eleanor Roosevelt,&quot; she said. &quot;Eleanor 
        became FDR's eyes and ears, bringing him information and stories about 
        people in the country.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Goodwin, the incorporation of women into the 
        workforce, a move that Eleanor championed, was &quot;the most important 
        social trend of the 20th century.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Roosevelt presidency was not without its dark moments, 
        Goodwin said. She called the internment of Japanese-Americans during World 
        War II &quot;one of the greatest failures&quot; of FDR's term. She acknowledged 
        that his advisors had called it a &quot;military necessity&quot; and pushed 
        for the action, but called FDR &quot;absolutely responsible for...one 
        of the most incredible violations of civil liberties in our history.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, Goodwin indicated that his judgment error contains 
        a positive connection to modern-day America. &quot;History can really 
        help us remember our mistakes,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope that the consciousness 
        and memory of [internment camps] is strong enough to remind our government 
        of what it cannot do.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When asked about the differences she perceives between today's 
        American presidency versus that of earlier times, Goodwin cited the level 
        of discussion regarding public figures as radically different. &quot;The 
        old theory was that private lives were only relevant if they affected 
        the person's leadership,&quot; she said. <br>
        The Monica Lewinsky scandal, among others, has &quot;...allowed the media 
        to focus on things that aren't important,&quot; she said. &quot;If we 
        had lost FDR because of his affairs, it would have been devastating.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another difference that Goodwin spoke of was the contemporary 
        presidency's lack of reach. &quot;It's harder to get majority attention; 
        a wide audience...that's due to competing interests,&quot; she said. &quot;This 
        war may change all that, and make the presidency a more revered institution.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodwin added that the terrorist attacks and subsequent 
        military response have affected Americans all over the country. &quot;More 
        people are making decisions that they wouldn't have made before September 
        11,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe that we have been provided with our 
        own rendezvous with destiny. It is the greatest opportunity for greater 
        deeds.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Goodwin has a Ph.D. in government from Harvard University, 
        and taught there for several years. She won the Pulitzer Prize for No 
        Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World 
        War II. She makes frequent appearances on national television.<br>
