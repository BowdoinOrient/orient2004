        <font size="2">MATTHEW SPOONER<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>This week, Bowdoin Professor Patrick Rael will unveil a unique new resource 
        for students and teachers hoping to learn more about slavery in the pre-Civil 
        War South. Rael's <a href="http://academic.bowdoin.edu/flighttofreedom/intro.shtml">Flight 
        to Freedom</a>, the result of two years of collaboration with the Educational 
        Technolgy Center, is a web-based game that allows players to struggle 
        first-hand with the challenges that fugitive African-Americans faced on 
        their perilous journey towards freedom.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;[Professor Rael] has combined two things in this project in a way 
        they haven't been before,&quot; said English Professor and ETC Director 
        Peter Schilling. &quot;One is the theory of history that to learn a type 
        of culture you have to learn its stories, and the other is the theory 
        of learning that you learn best when you have to solve problems rather 
        than learn information passively.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Flight to Freedom allows the player to experience the stories of those 
        who lived them. The database of over 750 entries created for the project 
        was designed around the autobiographies and personal narratives of enslaved 
        African-Americans who fled bondage in the south. Users are in fact able 
        to &quot;play&quot; the role of famous narrative authors that Rael and 
        his assistants studied, including Frederick Douglass and Harriett Tubman.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the game, the player is presented with a scenario inspired by the 
        contemporary, antebellum publications. The turn consists of the player 
        choosing one out of several possible actions. For example, after having 
        just been beaten after capture, should the player rest to recover strength 
        or make another attempt at escape? <br>
      </p>
      <p>After the player decides on a course of action, the computer randomly 
        selects an event entry from within certain parameters in the database. 
        The ultimate object is to rescue your family members enslaved in the south 
        and, then, to escape with them to Canada and freedom.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When asked about the inspiration for this project, Rael explained that 
        he has been interested in educational simulation ever since graduate school. 
        &quot;Our students are growing up in a world of ever expanding media that 
        constantly vie for their attention,&quot; he said. &quot;It is crucial 
        that educators take advantage of new technologies in order to both hold 
        students attention and to address their wide variety of learning styles.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Also,&quot; he admitted with a grin, &quot;I like games.&quot; 
        Still, historical simulations are much different than conventional computer 
        games. As Rael said, they &quot;challenge users to confront the past in 
        a way that is fundamentally different from books and lectures. By establishing 
        parameters for behavior and systems for incentives and rewards, simulations 
        permit users to experience the problems and conflicts that motivated those 
        in the past.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Originally imagining that Flight to Freedom would end up as a board game, 
        the decision to turn it into a web-based simulation was reached in discussions 
        between Rael, Schilling, and other members of ETC because of a computer's 
        ability to make the in-game situations more specific and realistic. &quot;A 
        computer can keep track of various circumstances and can respond to various 
        situations,&quot; said Rael. For example, certain events will only occur 
        to women and others only in specific cities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rael and a group of student assistants assembled the database by researching 
        historical documents. &quot;Students did this work, and it was real historical 
        work,&quot; Rael said. &quot;They had to search documents, edit, and write 
        entries.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Once the database had been assembled, a group of ETC web-designers and 
        programmers under project head Kurt Greenstone undertook the task of creating 
        the software aspect. Between research, writing and programming, well over 
        1,000 man-hours have been spent on the project so far, a number that will 
        increase as Rael's future students continue to add additional entries 
        to the game database.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Without the ETC we couldn't possible have done this,&quot; Rael 
        said. &quot;The office is a model for how academics can translate their 
        ideas into educational technology.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each year, Schilling explained, the office selects three faculty proposals 
        and then works with professors and students to merge academics and technology. 
        Flight to Freedom is one of many projects the ETC is currently working 
        on. Others include 'Zen Garden,' and a tool that will tailor the Introductory 
        Biology curriculum to a student's personal learning preferences.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rael hopes that his work will create excitement about using interactive 
        methods to learn about the past. &quot;So far, technology has not changed 
        the way we learn about the past. The Internet is just used as an interesting 
        way of conveying information in the way it always has been. We're trying 
        to explore the interactivity of the web and the way we can learn from 
        it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rael also intends for Flight to Freedom to serve as a nexus to inspire 
        further investigations about African-American life by students, educators, 
        and researchers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If nothing else, the vivid images and stories within which the game enmeshes 
        the player will bring color and life to a crucial aspect of our nation's 
        history.<br>
        &quot;When we include stories of the oppressed in our national story we 
        are not simply adding voices,&quot; Rael said. &quot;These stories challenge 
        us to change the way we tell all our national stories.&quot;</p>
