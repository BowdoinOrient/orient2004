        </font></p>
      <p>As we walk through the Union and across the Quad, as we mingle at parties 
        and sit in class, we see and talk to many different people. We are not 
        attracted to all of them, but there are always those that stick out: the 
        guy you hope is single, the girl whose last name you bother to find out 
        so you can look her up on the directory. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But why do we do this? How can we see two people and so quickly decide 
        that one is right for romance, but the other is not? One word: &quot;appearance.&quot; 
        Lots of people say &quot;he's not my type&quot; or &quot;she's my type 
        of girl,&quot; simply based on appearance. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So this week I investigate CAN PEOPLE REALLY HAVE A 'TYPE' BASED MERELY 
        ON PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND IF SO, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Brad is quite predictable, as far as romance is concerned. His friends 
        joke that they can walk into a room and point out exactly which girls 
        he likes, and they are never surprised when he asks someone out. Moreover, 
        all of these girls resemble the first girl he was ever in love with. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This brings up the question of whether or not type is dictated by our 
        first crushes or first loves, if there is a prototype that we create based 
        on what we first learned. But how far back does this go? Is this Oedipal? 
        Are all of the girls Brad is attracted to really just like his mother?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Carrie says, &quot;I certainly find that there is a type of guy who attracts 
        me the most initially. I am not attracted to all guys like this and there 
        are many guys who, once I get to know, I am also very attracted to. But 
        there is no denying that there is one type of guy who catches my attention 
        first.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Who knows how she got this idea into her head, but somewhere along the 
        line she figured out that there was one type of guy for her. She knows 
        exactly what he looks like and can always pick him out of a crowd. Whom 
        she will not pick out is the nice, sweet guy next to him who just doesn't 
        have that 'look.'<br>
      </p>
      <p>Charlotte supports her friend when she says, &quot;If we are at a party, 
        I can point to someone and say, 'Carrie, you are definitely attracted 
        to that guy,' and generally I'm right. It's pretty sick.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Brad appears to be even more set in his ways, to the point where his 
        friends sometimes wonder if he could ever be attracted to someone who 
        did not look like the standard model. Whereas Carrie knows she has a &quot;type,&quot; 
        Brad is not even aware that all of the girls he dates look alike. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But both have been heard to say the same things such as the following: 
        &quot;S/He is really good-looking and I really like him/her, but s/he's 
        just not my type.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus they both can, in essence, be attracted to someone and reject him 
        or her because they do not fit into a physical mold!<br>
      </p>
      <p>Will, on the other hand, is utterly in opposition. &quot;What are you 
        talking about 'type?' I am attracted to so many different types of girls. 
        It would be ridiculous to say that I am only attracted to people with 
        certain physical qualities.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>He has found himself attracted to tall girls, short girls, thin girls, 
        heavier girls, blonde girls, and brunette girls. Will finds that he has 
        the potential to be attracted to virtually anyone and would never want 
        to hinder that by adhering to criteria. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Will appears to be the healthiest of the three. Since he does not confine 
        himself, he has a greater chance of really finding someone. As long as 
        Brad continues to ask out only girls that look alike and Carrie never 
        considers guys romantically unless they look like what she considers to 
        be her &quot;type,&quot; then they are most likely going to simply become 
        frustrated. They should strive to be more like Will, who understands that 
        first impressions based on looks alone are not indicative of who the person 
        is inside; someone who looks just like every other girl he's dated might 
        not be right for him, and someone who does not look like them at all may 
        be perfect. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And so I urge you to throw out these notions of &quot;type.&quot; Do 
        not limit yourself to only those people who look one way, because you 
        have convinced yourself that they are the only people you can like. If 
        you take a second look, you could be very surprised at who you may be 
        attracted to. <br>
