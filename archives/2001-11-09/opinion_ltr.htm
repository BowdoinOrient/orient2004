      <p align="left">To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>On October 19, four Bowdoin students headed to Washington, D.C. for Econference 
        2001, a national conference on social and environmental activism.<br>
        One of the take-homes for us was national energy policy-and particularly, 
        the fate and state of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Last 
        week, along with pages of your supporting signatures, we sent a version 
        of the following letter to the governing bodies of Maine:</p>
      <p>&quot;We, the undersigned members of the Bowdoin College Community, are 
        deeply and profoundly concerned about Climate Change. We want to see a 
        national energy policy that aims at the reduction of carbon dioxide and 
        other green house gasses&#133;.Please support the development and consumption 
        of renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic and wind rather than 
        continue subsidies to fossil fuel production and distribution. Please 
        also support increases in Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and eliminate 
        the loophole that allows Sport Utility Vehicles and other light trucks 
        to use more gasoline than cars. Please support public transportation initiatives. 
        Lastly, please oppose the opening of new oil drilling or coal mining sites 
        across the nation, especially those in ecologically sensitive areas, such 
        as the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve.&quot;</p>
      <p>The implications of oil exploration and drilling are profound. The native 
        Gwichin people have made it crystal clear they oppose drilling. These 
        natives (whose name actually means &quot;Caribou people&quot;) have lived 
        peacefully for 20,000 years on the northern Alaskan plain, and depend 
        entirely on the fall caribou migration for food as well as cultural sustenance. 
        They are the voice of a minority people who will most adversely and most 
        certainly be affected by drilling.<br>
        Urge your senators to block any legislation that calls for drilling in 
        the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. <br>
      </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="ltr02"></a>Tighter security needed at the library</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>Representative of how sheltered my life is, I witnessed my first crime 
        tonight. My friend's laptop was stolen from his library carrel, and I 
        was the only witness. Around 8:00 two teenagers passed me in the library, 
        greeted me, and passed around the corner. They were tense, and upon their 
        overly friendly greeting, I knew that something was wrong. After they 
        passed, I quickly followed. I saw one sit at a carrel, which I found out 
        later was my friend's. He was playing with something as the other stood 
        guard. I immediately ran downstairs and reported the behavior to a member 
        of the library list. He was asked if I wanted him to go up to kick them 
        out. I replied that would be great, but by the time he went upstairs, 
        the two guys and the laptop were gone. A half hour later, my friend ran 
        past me frantically asking if I had seen his laptop.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Later that evening, I talked with the library employee. He admitted that 
        he thought I was a bit paranoid at first and did not understand my concern. 
        He also admitted that he did not know what to do. As a senior, I have 
        seen many library goods disappear. Carrels are a student's personal space, 
        and a simple bathroom trip always leaves a laptop exposed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There needs to be a review of security efforts in the library. Library 
        employees should have a procedure when someone is suspected or attempting 
        to steal from the library. This is not a new issue and should have been 
        reviewed and prepared for ages ago. Perhaps the sixth webcam should be 
        placed at the entrance of the library and not at the drink line of Thorne 
        hall. </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="ltr03"></a>Alums ask for end to fraternity slander</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the editor:</p>
      <p>We, the undersigned alumni of the Bowdoin chapter of the Alpha Delta 
        Phi Society, were extremely disappointed to read the following statement 
        in the Winter 2001 edition of the alumni magazine:<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Mills pledged Alpha Delta Phi during his first weekend on campus. 
        Being the studious sort, he never lived at the house....&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In our experience as members of the Alpha Delta Phi who lived in the 
        house and as recognized scholars in the Bowdoin community and beyond, 
        it was quite possible to be both studious and to live at the house. In 
        fact, some of us found it easier to accomplish our studies in front of 
        a crackling fire in a communal living room than it was in the clamorous, 
        unpredictable setting of a dormitory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While perpetuating negative stereotypes about fraternities was no doubt 
        a valuable tactic in garnering support for their abolition, the war is 
        now over. For good or bad, Bowdoin has succeeded in eliminating Greek-letter 
        fraternities, sororities, and societies. It is time to stop vilifying 
        the organizations that formed the backbone of Bowdoin's social system 
        for over 150 years. It is time to stop vilifying the people-all of them 
        Bowdoin alumni-who joined these organizations and found them a valuable 
        and integral part of the Bowdoin experience. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The anti-fraternity offensive is over, and Bowdoin has won; it is now 
        appropriate for Bowdoin to be magnanimous in victory, remembering that 
        the people on the other side are Bowdoin alumni just as much as those 
        who never set foot in a fraternity house. Such continued anti-fraternity 
        spin is unseemly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin chapter of the Alpha Delta Phi is proud to count among its 
        members three of Bowdoin's distinguished presidents: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 
        Roger Howell, and now Barry Mills. It is doubtful that in Chamberlain 
        or Howell's day it would have seemed important to offer ironic commentary 
        in a Bowdoin publication on the nature or tenure of their fraternity membership.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is most unfortunate that Bowdoin, which purports to educate its students 
        in the liberal arts, should present such a one-sided view, biased in favor 
        of its interests, without even acknowledging the existence of another 
        point of view. This sort of bias has no place in a community which claims 
        to be intellectually honest.</p>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="ltr04"></a>&quot;Vagina facts&quot; meant to empower women</font></p>
      <p>To the Editor,</p>
      <p>We, the V-Day Bowdoin College 2002 Committee, are writing to inform the 
        community about the reasoning behind the perhaps shocking or controversial 
        &quot;vagina facts&quot; in Smith Union. V-Day is a global movement to 
        stop violence against women and girls. We are raising money for the Sexual 
        Assault Services of Southern Maine and for the women suffering in Afghanistan. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, our goal is to raise awareness in the community about these 
        issues and empower the women and girls of Bowdoin and Brunswick through 
        a celebration of their womanhood. The centerpiece of the V-Day movement 
        is a production of Eve Ensler's &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot; which 
        will be performed in February.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Before the production we are seeking to raise money and awareness through 
        various campus activities, including outreach tables, a coffee house, 
        and informative posters around campus. It has come to our attention that 
        some members of the community have expressed discomfort with the &quot;vagina 
        facts&quot; in the union. Those facts are part of an effort to generate 
        positive energy around this sensitive topic. <br>
      </p>
      <p>V-Day is about stopping violence in creative ways. Empowering women and 
        celebrating their bodies is one of the best methods of preventing violence 
        and supporting its victims.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We hope that women and men will recognize the importance of creating 
        a vocabulary that includes the word vagina, in order to promote discussion 
        pertaining to sexual violence. We respect the discomfort some members 
        of the community may feel, but hope that everyone will allow themselves 
        to be open minded and respectful towards this cause, which deeply effects 
        us all.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If you are interested in being a part of this movement or have questions 
        or concerns please contact Barbara Condliffe at bcondlif@bowdoin.edu.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="ltr05"></a>Hate speech best combatted through discussions, not College sanctions</font></p>
      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In his column, &quot;Education not Legislation&quot; (November 6), Todd 
        Buell suggests that the answer to the problems posed by Hate Speech is 
        education in what Aristotle deems &quot;moral virtues or what we call 
        right from wrong&quot;. Buell's suggestion, while on face a logical alternative 
        to legislation that impedes free speech, falls victim to the same problem. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>He suggests that the problem with hate crime legislation is that the 
        constitution is meant to protect everyone's speech, &quot;even those whose 
        hateful opinions we find rightfully reprehensible,&quot; and that hate 
        crime legislation targets opinions that the government disagrees with. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The problem is that his suggestion-education-also targets opinions that 
        go against the norm. Education in the form that he suggests-essentially 
        an education in what the educator believes is right-also silences people's 
        voices. <br>
      </p>
      <p>By educating a community to believe that a certain type of thought is 
        correct, an institution puts its imprimatur on one set of beliefs in a 
        manner not unlike that of a hate crimes statute. An institution such as 
        Bowdoin-engaging in an education campaign against discriminatory expression 
        would silence voices-not educate them. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If teaching the correct way to think or legislating is not the answer, 
        then what is the answer to the problem of offensive speech? I believe 
        the answer lies in discussions on discrimination and bias, which would 
        allow people to voice their opinions, rather than just receiving an official 
        college sanction for sharing a belief that makes people uncomfortable. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although punishments may solve the problem in the short run by signaling 
        that the college is taking action to remedy the problem, they do little 
        to eradicate the fundamental problem in the long run. Only by airing differences 
        in an open forum can we understand why others think the way they do and 
        help them understand the position we are coming from.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Although replacing education and sanctions with discussions would mean 
        that institutions took no official stance against hate speech, this is 
        not necessarily a bad thing. In his dissent in Abrams v. US, Supreme Court 
        Justice Holmes wrote that &quot;the ultimate good desired is better reached 
        by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of the 
        thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market....&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Holmesian marketplace of ideas, achieved through discussions, would 
        show people with fringe ideas what the mass accepted without putting an 
        institutional stamp on ideas.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Consider one example from this school year where institutional sanction 
        most likely did hardly anything, and where open forums could have potentially 
        done more. Recently, the student body received a letter from the school 
        stating that there had been two bias-incidents on campus, one directly 
        targeting Jewish students. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a Jew, I was angry and saddened by the events. Yet a letter from the 
        school saying that Bowdoin does not tolerate this behavior most likely 
        did nothing and certainly did not make me feel more comfortable. Those 
        who committed these speech acts probably knew the institution did not 
        agree with them. What they probably didn't know was why their view was 
        hurtful to me. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If the College held a moderated discussion instead of sending a letter 
        to the student body, students could voice their opinions about how these 
        events affected them, and the dialogue about the event could have deterred 
        a future occurrence. People need to argue and get upset about events in 
        order to come to a common agreement. Only when popular opinion puts pressure 
        on the behavior we seek to eradicate, will an environment exist that is 
        safe and does not hide dangers like skeletons in the closet. </p>
