      <p>What could motivate four otherwise sane individuals to spend two and 
        a half hours on a beautiful Tuesday afternoon digging through sixteen 
        bags of garbage? A desire to help Bowdoin reach its goal of recycling 
        30% of its waste stream. An environmental audit conducted on campus last 
        year found that this great institution recycled a mere 15% of its waste 
        stream. This figure looks even more pathetic when compared with the 60% 
        that Middlebury and Bates recycle annually. <br>
      </p>

            sort through trash on Tuesday afternoon from various College buildings.

      <p>As a result of the audit, the college hired Keisha Payson as its sustainability 
        coordinator to help the school reduce its environmental impact. Many students 
        were interested in helping Keisha and as a result, Sustainable Bowdoin 
        was born. The group has the lofty goals of reducing the college's energy 
        consumption and paper use, writing an environmental statement to be published 
        in the handbook, increasing recycling, and beginning a composting project 
        among others. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The trash audit was intended to get students, faculty, and staff to think 
        about the waste the college generates-all of which goes to the Brunswick 
        landfill, which will be full by 2012-and highlight areas where the college 
        needs to improve.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The garbage for the audit came from four buildings: Cram Alumni House, 
        Baxter House, Hubbard Hall, and H&amp;L. No dorm trash was to be used. 
        However, there was a mix-up with facilities management and four bags of 
        intimidating Baxter House garbage arrived. The trash was weighed and then 
        sorted into six categories: high-grade paper, newspaper, returnables, 
        #2 plastic (all plastic is recyclable, but only #2 is collected at Bowdoin), 
        cardboard, and trash. After they were sorted, the bags were weighed once 
        more.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Digging through the first few bags, a sense of near euphoria swept the 
        group. There was hardly a returnable can in sight. Cram Alumni trash consisted 
        mostly of food waste, lots of styrofoam plates and napkins, some Dominos 
        boxes, and plastic utensils. Sustainable Bowdoin encourages the use of 
        non-disposable utensils, plates, and cups whenever possible and gently 
        reminds the folks at Cram Alumni House that styrofoam never decomposes. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Digging with newfound confidence into the Baxter bags, the group was 
        pleasantly surprised to find not one recyclable item. The bad news is 
        that the trash was mostly paper towels-oh yeah and beer cups. Hand dryers 
        would be more sanitary and reduce solid waste. But still, nice job Baxter. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The euphoria did not last however. As the group plunged into the first 
        bag from Hubbard Hall, the mood quickly hit its nadir. Brightly colored 
        pieces of high-grade paper burst from the bag along with books (yes, whole 
        books!), envelopes corrugated cardboard, and returnable bottles and cans 
        hidden deep within Polar lunch bags. All of these items are recyclable! 
        The trash consisted of mostly paperboard (which is recyclable, but not 
        in Brunswick) and much styrofoam. (We are trying to get a styrofoam recycling 
        plan to Bowdoin but tragically it currently must be put on hold). Hubbard 
        was a pretty grim scene, especially since there are numerous recycle bins 
        in that building. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As the wind picked up, the group finished off with Hawthorne Longfellow 
        Library. The biggest recyclable that was thrown away was paper, but much 
        less than the group had originally feared. There were also many little 
        plastic envelope windows that few people know are actually recycleable 
        along with high-grade paper.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The official results of the audit are below. The percentages are calculated 
        by weight and include materials which were contaminated by contact with 
        garbage, but were originally recyclable. Rounding of figures resulted 
        in some non-100% totals). </p>
      <p>Cram Alumni House:<br>
        High-grade paper 2%<br>
        Newspaper 2%<br>
        Returnables 6%<br>
        #2 Plastic 0%<br>
        Cardboard 0%<br>
        Non-recyclables (garbage) 90%</p>
      <p>Baxter House:<br>
        Non-recyclables (garbage) 100%</p>
      <p>Hawthorne-Longfellow:<br>
        High-grade paper 19%<br>
        Newspaper 6%<br>
        Returnables 6%<br>
        #2 Plastic 0%<br>
        Cardboard 0%<br>
        Non-recyclables (garbage) 70%</p>
      <p>Hubbard Hall:<br>
        High-grade paper 39%<br>
        Newspaper 4%<br>
        Returnables 3%<br>
        #2 Plastic 0%<br>
        Cardboard 1%<br>
        Non-recyclables (garbage) 52%</p>
      <p>So why recycle? It saves trees, but perhaps more importantly, recycling 
        saves energy. For example, it takes 96% less energy to recycle an aluminum 
        can than it does to make one out of virgin ore. Saving energy means saving 
        coal and oil, which is good news from both an environmental and a national 
        security standpoint: the latter because it would make us less reliant 
        on foreign oil. The amount of energy the US saves from recycling each 
        year could run the country for 4 months. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So break out your Nalgenes, bring your own mug to dinner, get one of 
        those super cool lunch bags (only $4 and you can use polar points), and 
        put your cans, newspapers, and flyers in the clearly marked bins.<br>
