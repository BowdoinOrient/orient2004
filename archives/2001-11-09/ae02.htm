      <p align="left"><font size="5">Lanford Wilson's <i>Book of Days</i></font><br>
        <font size="2">MATT SPOONER<br>
        STAFF WRITER <br>
        </font></p>
      <p>It might seem awkward to mention September 11 at the beginning of an 
        article about the Bowdoin theater department's production of Lanford Wilson's 
        play <i>Book of Days</i>. Still, it seems that ever since that fateful day, people 
        are compelled to look closer at their country, their world, and their 
        lives. Maybe, then, it isn't such a bad introduction after all.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're all in a very unsettled state,&quot; said director and theater 
        department head David Robinson. &quot;But if any art-form can help us 
        figure out what makes us tick, what motivates people, it's the theater.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Book of Days</i> does just that. The play chronicles a year in the 
        life of the fictional small town Dublin, Missouri and the attempt of cheese 
        factory bookkeeper Ruth Hoch to seek truths after the sudden death of 
        the town patriarch. More than that, Robinson says, the play is also about 
        moral complexities.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;As I read the play, my mind keeps coming back to Barry Mills speech 
        where he spoke about 'the common good.' <i>Book of Days</i> is very much 
        about just how complicated that is. [Playwright] Wilson isn't interested 
        in a well-rounded diatribe--[the play] is gray on gray.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>To those who are familiar with Wilson's work, this should come as little 
        surprise. The Pulitzer-prize winning playwright of Tailey's Folley and 
        Fifth of July has become renowned for drama that touches, rather than 
        delves into truths and leaves the audience to struggle with dreams and 
        failures alongside his characters.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Wilson grew up as a country boy who knew how to milk cows,&quot; 
        Robsinson explained. &quot;When he returned to the south, he became worried 
        with how unquestioning people were. [Because of that], his plays focus 
        on something that we certainly need to be looking at: question authoirity 
        all the time.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Wilson's work is often compared with the famous Russian playwright Anton 
        Chekov for his deft mastery of language and sense of place. Fortunately, 
        the winner of two New York City Drama Critics awards for best play, a 
        Drama-Desk award, and a Drama-Logue award, is allowing his play to appear 
        at Bowdon's Pickard theater before its New York premier.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;With the elections last year, the idealism of the people who teach 
        and learn here &#133; this play really rang true,&quot; Robinson said 
        about his choosing <i>Book of Days</i>. &quot;Also, I wanted to direct 
        a show with a smaller cast, to focus on acting values. Plus it's a great 
        story and it's very funny.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Much like Our Town did a few decades ago, <i>Book of Days</i> paints 
        a picture of small town life and through it touches on morals, values, 
        and clashes that the characters deal with. And like Our Town, <i>Book 
        of Days</i> features a play within a play.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I love any play that deals with life in the theater,&quot; Robinson 
        said. &quot;Most of all though, it's entertaining and it has ideas that 
        are worth entertaining.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Set designer Judy Gailen agreed. &quot;It keeps coming at you,&quot; 
        she said. She said the set she designed was inspired by the sparseness 
        of the play and the theme of happenings taking place behind closed doors. 
        In contrast to the spectacular set that was made for last year's The Visit, 
        Gailen designed a set that would put the actors at the forefront.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Aside from that, though, Robinson and Gailen won't reveal much. After 
        all, it is a mystery play. &quot;It's exciting, funny, and entertaining 
        and I hope everyone in Maine comes to see it,&quot; Robsinson grinned.<br>
