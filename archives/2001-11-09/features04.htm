        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>In 1854, William Pitt Fessenden, of the Bowdoin class of 1823, went to 
        the United States Senate as a Whig. A year later, he joined a newly formed 
        political party to help fight the expansion of human slavery. The members 
        of this party called themselves Republicans. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hopeful that the upcoming presidential elections might swing in their 
        favor, the Republicans quickly organized. Fessenden dedicated his time 
        to helping with conventions and rallies. In Washington, he also waged 
        a war in the Senate against President Franklin Pierce's (Bowdoin class 
        of 1824) condemnation of Northern supporters in Kansas.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1856, as the Republicans met to nominate a presidential candidate, 
        Fessenden's youngest son, fourteen-year-old Sam, decided to run away and 
        join the fight in Kansas, which was quickly escalating to a civil war. 
        After his return from the West, Sam Fessenden, a few months shy of joining 
        the Bowdoin class of 1861, wrote about his adventures.<br>
      </p>
      <p>He had set out in the summer of 1856 and journeyed as far as Illinois 
        and Iowa. There, he found passage to St. Louis with little money and only 
        one set of clothing. In the midst of his journey he suddenly became quite 
        lonely. &quot;I stood on those streets without money,&quot; he wrote, 
        &quot;without friends, and let my thoughts wander back hundreds of miles 
        away to one family hearthstone, where stood one vacant chair, made so 
        by my thoughtlessness.&quot; Despite this sudden homesickness, Sam decided 
        to push on. He went to Missouri where he joined a band of twenty men from 
        Illinois, headed for Kansas.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kansas, at that time, had two political factions waging a war over whether 
        the territory should be a slave state or a free one. The idea of popular 
        sovereignty was showing itself to be a disaster, as both sides killed 
        and pillaged for their own cause. The sacking of anti-slavery town Lawrence 
        by Southern sympathizers near the end of May had set off a spark that 
        was to earn the territory the nickname, &quot;bleeding Kansas.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>On July 3, 1856, Sam Fessenden arrived in this, his first war zone. Remembering 
        that there was no opposition to this armed group's landing in Kansas City, 
        the teen recalled that trouble was waiting for them when they tried to 
        collect their supplies at a local warehouse. From &quot;out of every grocery 
        and groggery poured a motley crowd, some armed with U.S. muskets,&quot; 
        Sam wrote, &quot;&#133;others with bowie-knives, revolvers, and all sorts 
        of firearms, and we found ourselves surrounded, and had we been armed 
        it would have been madness to resist. We surrendered&#133;.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>When the mob found that these Union men had with them weapons, &quot;a 
        shower of oaths mingled with threats and menaces&quot; were hurled at 
        them. &quot;I was the youngest of the band, [which was] surrounded, robbed, 
        and subjected to any amount of abuse, but I thought myself shrewd and 
        accordingly assumed an air of perfect indifference, sat upon the top of 
        a barrel, lit a cigar, and calmly watched the opening of trunks, valises, 
        and everything that was supposed to contain firearms of a larger or smaller 
        sort.&quot; Threats &quot;of hanging, lynching, and various other pleasantries 
        issued from the mouths of chivalric Southern gentlemen&quot; were heard, 
        but Sam Fessenden and his fellow freedom fighters were soon out of danger. 
        The mob escorted the Northerners through &quot;a crowd of yelling and 
        hooting ruffians&quot; and sent them back to Illinois on a boat headed 
        in the same direction in which they came. As a parting gesture, Sam remembered 
        that the Southerners proclaimed &quot;that Territory &#133;should be filled 
        with slaves, and thus consecrated to sin and darkness forever.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Pitt Fessenden was no doubt very glad to have his youngest son back at 
        home. Soon the boy would be at Bowdoin College to pursue a career and 
        watch from Maine as the country slipped into civil war. In the same class 
        as Sam Fessenden was a youngster from Bath named Thomas Worchester Hyde.<br>
        A new administration entered the White House in 1857 as Franklin Pierce 
        exited the stage. It was the time of James Buchanan, and it was the final 
        step before the bloodletting of the Civil War.<br>
      </p>
