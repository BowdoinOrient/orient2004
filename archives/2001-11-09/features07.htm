        <font size="2">MATTHEW SPOONER<br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it seems that the American media tends to largely ignore 
        countries that our nation is not directly involved with. The events precipitated 
        by September 11, however, have sparked large amounts of interest in the 
        republics of Central Asia, many of whom are allowing the United States 
        to launch strikes against Afghanistan from their airfields and military 
        bases.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A forum, held Tuesday night, featured three speakers who shared their 
        personal, political, and economic experience with the region: Micheal 
        Wygant, Gulnara Abikeyeva, and Darren Gacicia. The goal of the forum, 
        as stated by mediator and government professor Marcia Wigle, was to help 
        members of the Bowdoin and Brunswick community understand the culture 
        of the Central Asian people and their emerging relationship with the U.S.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Wygant, a career diplomat with over 30 years experience, assisted in 
        the opening of the United State's first embassies in Kazakhstan and Kyrgystan 
        after the dissolution of the USSR. Recently, the Maine resident has devoted 
        endless amounts of time and energy to the Bowdoin and Maine communities. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ambassador Wygant spoke on Central Asia's past historical role as a passageway 
        for people, such as Genghis Khan and Alexander and also about the way 
        the politics of the region are shaping asians' role in the world today.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Having been conquered by Tsarist Russia in the late 19th century, the 
        region was transformed into one of the main wheat producing areas in the 
        Soviet Union. The transformation was not without cost, however, as an 
        estimated 1/3 of the historically nomadic Kazak population died of starvation 
        during forced collectivization.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Since the dissolution of the USSR, the Central Asian nations have been 
        struggling to find direction and a sense of national identity. &quot;I 
        think that it's fair to say that on the eve of [communism's fall] none 
        of these republics were prepared for independence,&quot; Wygant said. 
        Ironically, in most of the nations the government has changed very little- 
        Communist Party leaders have simply changed titles and kept almost authoritarian 
        power.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kazakhstan and the nations surrounding it are also fighting outside influences 
        from abroad and each other. &quot;Before receiving independence it seemed 
        that all of us were Soviet People. After 1991, it is evident that there 
        is a great deal of interest [in the republics],&quot; said Dr. Abikeyeva. 
        Dr. Abikeyeva recently arrived at Bowdoin from her native Kazakhstan, 
        where she serves as Arts and Culture Program Coordinator for the Soros 
        Foundation of Kazakhstan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After independence, with Russia politically unstable, Chinese, Arabic, 
        and Western influences have been seeping into the cultures. Islamic influence 
        has been particularly strong. For example, under the USSR there was only 
        one Mosque in the Kazakhstan capital of 2 million. Since independence, 
        different sects of Islam have sent scholars and money to assist with the 
        construction of dozens of Mosques to stimulate the Muslim faith within 
        the city.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The status of women and children is also changing. Under Soviet Control, 
        women were expected and even required to receive a level of education 
        that was equal to their male counterparts. Now, Dr. Abikeyeva said, only 
        36 percent of teenage girls attend high school. Many can be found on the 
        streets peddling wares so that their family can have enough to eat. The 
        average monthly income in certain areas is enough to buy only 6 portions 
        of bread.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That may change at least to some degree as western industry takes an 
        interest in the area's development. The sudden turning of heads is due 
        somewhat to the fact that the Central Asian Republics are an untapped 
        marketplace. More so, however, according to Gacicia, increasing western 
        economic influence is due to Central Asia's huge, untapped oil reserves, 
        who now works with CitiGroup Asset Management and specializes on firms 
        and industries involved in oil extraction in the former Soviet Union.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The former Soviet republics contain an estimated 2-8 percent of the world's 
        oil reserves and with North Sea reserves running dry and Western relations 
        with OPEC in question, multi-internationals are offering huge amounts 
        of money to governments for the rights to explore and drill within the 
        borders. According to Gacicia, the same big oil companies that own 83 
        percent of oil interests in the Middle East look to own a similar, if 
        not larger, share of the pie in Kazakhstan. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hopefully, the investments that western industry is making in Central 
        Asia will improve the way of life, although according to Gacicia and Dr. 
        Abikeyeva it depends largely upon the way the governments of the different 
        countries spend the money they receive. Many allege that Uzbek president 
        Islom Karimov has more or less pocketed an extraordinary sum of money 
        given to Uzbekistan by the oil industry.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One thing, however, seems certain: life in Central Asia has changed drastically 
        and will continue to do so. &quot;The newest history of Central Asia is 
        one of fighting, as the republics fight with each other for political 
        influence and people from other nations fight for [sway] over our culture,&quot; 
        said Dr. Abikeyeva.<br>
        When asked about the direction in which the area's culture was headed, 
        she simply said, &quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
