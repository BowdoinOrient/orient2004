        <font size="2">HUGH HILL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Everyone who read James Fisher's piece in the Orient (&quot;<a href="../2001-10-26/news01.htm">Students 
        stymied by copyright violations</a>,&quot; October 26) regarding Bowdoin 
        College's recent attempts to enforce the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright 
        Act should be dismayed. <br>
        <br>
        It is a sad day when an institution dedicated to the dissemination of 
        knowledge and information becomes the enforcer for corporate greed. The 
        fact that Bowdoin enforced this law should be a matter of concern for 
        everyone in the Bowdoin community. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin's first priority, and that of her Computing and Information Services 
        staff, should always be the members of her community. The way in which 
        Eric Morin '02 was treated by CIS is inexcusable. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Why didn't CIS contact Morin and ask him: <br>
        A) If he had actually downloaded material that was technically in violation 
        of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) <br>
        B) If he still had the files on his hard drive<br>
        C) If he would he remove the offending files from his hard drive<br>
      </p>
      <p>Why did it take over ten days before Morin was notified as to his denial 
        of service? <br>
      </p>
      <p>These questions are distressing at best. The treatment given is based 
        solely on the word of an organization not in any way affiliated with the 
        College. It raises serious questions about Bowdoin's commitment to its 
        students. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It must be noted that new steps taken by Bowdoin this week are a great 
        step forward and will, hopefully, prevent the abuse suffered by Mr. Morin 
        and the other students. CIS has, on the whole, had a positive history 
        in relation to the rest of the College. It can only be hoped that this 
        treatment was an aberration and not a harbinger of things to come. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In a larger sense, this issue begs the question as to how far the College 
        should go in enforcing this new law. Obviously the College does not want 
        to be in violation of the law. However, the College does occasionally 
        turn a blind eye to some of the more dubious laws of this nation and of 
        this state. If you doubt me on this, head to any College-sponsored campus 
        wide to witness Security blatantly ignoring certain ridiculous laws regarding 
        a twenty-one year age limit. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To stretch it even further, I'm sure that some of the College's residential 
        policies violate Maine's Victorian-era moral legislation regarding the 
        co-habitation of unmarried people. However, I do applaud Bowdoin for its 
        selective enforcement of some of the sillier laws of this land. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I would argue that the College afford the DMCA the same treatment it 
        gives other ridiculous laws. Intellectual property should be preserved; 
        that is a given. This should be balanced with the desire of the academic 
        community for the free and unfettered flow of information. It is not hard 
        to foresee some Machiavellian corporate lawyer forbidding access to an 
        academic site because the author quoted copyrighted material without paying 
        whatever exorbitant fee is demanded. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, the College should enforce the law. Obviously students 
        profiting off the illegal distribution of copyrighted material should 
        be stopped. But when a 19 year-old student who downloads the newest teeny 
        pop song in between classes is threatened with disciplinary and legal 
        action, the boundary of the ridiculous is crossed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If Bowdoin wants to enforce this law, so be it. The College has managed 
        to, thus far, walk a fine line between compliance and enforcement with 
        most other ridiculous laws. Let us hope that the digital copyright issue 
        is handled in the same, sensible manner.</p>
