      <p align="left">New procedures for addressing allegations of online copyright 
        infringement on the Bowdoin computer network are relatively lenient in 
        comparison with similar policies at Bates and Colby.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The policy, distributed via email by the Student Computing Committee 
        to all students, is the result of more than a week's worth of deliberation 
        by deans, CIS administrators, and students. The new procedures are meant 
        to prevent confusion and delay when copyright holders notify the College 
        that individual computer users are illegally sharing copyrighted material 
        through Bowdoin's internet connection. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Agents for Sony Music Entertainment, Inc. identified at least seven such 
        students this semester and invoked the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
        of 1998 (DMCA) in emails to network administrators. The students were 
        making Sony-copyrighted songs-new and popular releases from Incubus and 
        Michael Jackson-available for download via file sharing programs, including 
        Aimster and Morpheus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first students were identified in early September, and the College 
        immediately disconnected their ethernet ports; the students were not told 
        for several days why that had happened. By late October, however, CIS 
        was leaving Sony-identified users on the network, waiting for the deans 
        to agree on a step-by-step policy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The new procedures give students two business days to respond to allegations 
        of copyright infringement under the DMCA. If CIS receives &quot;a response 
        from the student stating that the content in question has been removed&quot; 
        in that time, the matter is closed in technical terms: CIS will not &quot;chill&quot; 
        that student's internet access port. </p>
      <p>If CIS does not receive a reply from the student within two business 
        days, internet access will be turned off indefinitely, but it will be 
        reactivated as soon as the student responds. CIS will notify the student's 
        dean of the original allegation and the response, if any. <br>
      </p>
      <p>CIS will not investigate whether the material has actually been removed 
        from the student's shared folder. The individual student's affirmation 
        is the only license needed to keep the internet access flowing. In addition, 
        the student computing help desk, REACH, will help students to alter their 
        file sharing preferences to avoid or correct a copyright violation. The 
        policy is indulgent of causal users of file-sharing programs who may not 
        be aware that their music libraries are open to the world. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Colby College has a DMCA policy similar to Bowdoin's, but not as lenient. 
        Colby gives students 48 hours to respond to infringement allegations, 
        but the language adopted by Bowdoin administration allowing &quot;two 
        business days&quot; is intended to accommodate students who are on athletic 
        trips or Outing Club ventures for a weekend , for example.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Once network access has been turned off for a Colby student, signed notification 
        is required that the material has been removed. Under the new Bowdoin 
        policy, an email to CIS affirming that the infringing material is no longer 
        accessible is sufficient.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Colby's policy expressly exempts the College from participating in any 
        countersuits students may decide to bring against the copyright holders 
        and strongly discourages such countersuits. Bowdoin's policy does not 
        discuss any potential legal scenarios arising from DMCA notifications. 
        Bowdoin's recent statement also avoids mention of College disciplinary 
        action in cases of file-sharing copyright violations. Colby's policy, 
        in contrast, reaffirms the College's right to take disciplinary action. 
      </p>
      <p>Unlike Colby and Bowdoin, Bates College &quot;has not formally registered 
        according to the requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,&quot; 
        said Bates's Director of Information Services, Gene Weimers. Bates does 
        not have the same legal obligations under that law to respond to allegations 
        of copyright infringement. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Bates's administrators behave in a way similar to those 
        at Colby and Bowdoin when a notification is received. &quot;We notify 
        the user accordingly,&quot; Weimers said, &quot;and request and expect 
        that he or she will remove the indicated material. We are currently examining 
        what additional steps we should take.&quot; </p>
      <p>Weimers said that Bates had received notification of copyright violations 
        by some rights holders, but did not specify when, or how many. Weimers 
        noted that &quot;failure to comply [with the DMCA] can result in disciplinary 
        action on campus, civil proceedings, and/or criminal prosecution.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>That kind of language is conspicuously absent from Bowdoin's policy released 
        in October. While the College's long-standing copyright policies do acknowledge 
        that disciplinary and judicial punishments are possible outcomes in copyright 
        cases, the procedures detailed two weeks ago are more reassuring than 
        disquieting; Judicial Board cases do not seem likely in these cases, at 
        least for first-time offenders. </p>
