        <font size="2">GENEVIVE CREEDON<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>No one wants to believe that the truth is a matter of perception. <br>
        I heard someone say the other day that if he knew the truth, there is 
        no reason why he wouldn't want to convert others to his view. I looked 
        up the word &quot;truth&quot; in the dictionary, only to find that it 
        has eight definitions, although I'm sure we could come up with many more.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I'm one of these people who is continually seeking truth. The problem 
        is, of course, that it isn't something to be sought at all; it is to be 
        created.<br>
        We happen to be living through a moment in history during which the concept 
        and implications of truth are of definitive importance. The miscommunications 
        between cultures, religions, governments are all based upon varying conceptions 
        of truth. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We can't understand why terrorists would want to hijack airplanes and 
        drive them into our towers, because their cause is not true to us. Similarly 
        we don't understand the way Afghanistan treats its women, because that 
        truth in relation to the gender divide is completely outrageous to us. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>We certainly have the right to be opposed to the results of some people's 
        truths, but we have no right to contest the truth itself. The distinction 
        is not easy to make, especially because it can serve to exonerate the 
        racist who doesn't lynch, the supporter of terrorist views who doesn't 
        terrorize. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I once read a book, <i>Conversations with God</i>, in which it was implied 
        that Hitler may have gone to Heaven, simply because he carried his truth 
        out (to the extreme). It is something to contemplate, if you believe that 
        we are alive in order to fully become ourselves. Of course, the mere mention 
        of such a thought-that Hitler, with all the atrocities he put into action, 
        could have made it to Heaven-will make you cringe, and it certainly calls 
        into question many, if not all, of the morals we are taught to follow. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The example of Hitler can be applied to the present. Is it not conceivable 
        that the terrorists are in Heaven as you read? It is conceivable, even 
        if that thought is completely unpleasant.<br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the definitions for &quot;truth&quot; according to the American 
        Heritage Dictionary is &quot;God,&quot; a concept that is subject to much 
        doubt and speculation. Were the terrorists not acting in the name of God? 
        Is God not a worthy cause? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Our response is that He is not. Indeed, he cannot be, because he is not 
        a cause at all. He is a figure, more or less present in our lives. Heaven 
        and Hell are ideas that have more or less tangible realities. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Truth implies immense consequences and a plethora of historical relevance 
        that most of us are not aware of. Hate is truth. Love is truth. Pain is 
        truth. Bliss is truth. Racism is truth. Equality is truth&#133;for someone. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Anything we want to tag as truth can become truth. Of course, it needs 
        to be proven, but proof is an arbitrary method of justification. We can 
        prove anything we want to prove if we try. We draw on premises and we 
        come to a conclusion, and because we have proven the conclusion, we take 
        it to be true, but a conclusion is only true if the premises are true; 
        it's easy to draw on untrue premises, and it's easy to make people believe 
        that those premises are true. <br>
        We use propaganda, we use brainwashing, we use education to drive people 
        to certain conclusions, and often we ignore whether those conclusions 
        are true. We simply accept them as so, because they are so prevalent, 
        but truth is a matter of perception. If you, who think the terrorism of 
        the past months is horrendous, were born elsewhere, perhaps in, say, Afghanistan, 
        would your truth dictate a different reaction?<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Are you going to kill someone? Are you going to kill yourself?&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>These are two questions a wise friend once asked in reference to a relative 
        crisis, and I think they're very relevant to evaluating our truth as individuals 
        and as a people. If the answer to either question is &quot;yes,&quot; 
        perhaps we ought to be reconsidering the motivating factor we call &quot;truth.&quot;
