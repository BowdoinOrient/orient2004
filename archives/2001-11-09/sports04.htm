        </font></p>
      <p> The New England Patriots are better than the Denver Broncos. As a diehard 
        Broncos' fan for life, the thought of the formerly shoddy Patriots becoming 
        a better team than the Broncos makes me shudder. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Both teams are 4-4 and need to establish a winning streak in the second 
        half of the season to make the playoffs. Led by second-year quarterback 
        Tom Brady, the Patriots are poised to make a run at it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, the Broncos, led by the fourth-year QB Brian Griese, are a team 
        destined for mediocrity - in other words, an 8-8 record. A trip to the 
        Super Bowl in New Orleans is out of the question unless they plan on paying 
        admission for bleacher seats.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And it all starts with the quarterbacks for these two organizations. 
        Brady backed-up the older Griese at the University of Michigan. In college, 
        Brady watched as Griese led the Wolverines to a national championship 
        in 1997.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Four years later, both QBs start in the National Football League in the 
        AFC. Furthermore, they are in the process of establishing themselves as 
        legitimate starters.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To make their transition from college to the NFL even more difficult, 
        they are following in the footsteps of Drew Bledsoe and John Elway - two 
        of the greatest quarterbacks of the 1990s.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="65" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="right">

          <td><img src="images/sports03_brady.jpg" width="65" height="90"></td>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>With Brady at the helm, New England has won four out of its past six 
        games to assert themselves as a quasi-force in the AFC East. During these 
        six games, Brady has completed 62.5% of his passes, throwing 10 touchdowns 
        with only four interceptions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>More importantly, Brady is making New England fans and his teammates 
        believe. After tossing four picks in the fourth quarter of 31-20 loss 
        to the Broncos, Brady bounced back the next week and threw for three touchdowns 
        in a 24-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus far, Brady's arm strength, poise, and leadership ability is responsible 
        for a porous football team making a run at a playoff birth.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The story is different for Brian Griese and his Broncos. Last year, Griese 
        played like a young Joe Montana by tossing 19 TDs and only four interceptions 
        in a season cut short by injury.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/sports04_griese.jpg" width="150" height="154"></td>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>However, after his breakout year, Brian Griese is currently floundering 
        due to the absence of stable running game, wide-out Ed McCaffrey, and 
        a dominant offensive line. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Like Brady, he has the poise, smarts, and guts to be a quarterback in 
        the National Football League. In fact, offensive mastermind and head coach 
        of the Denver Broncos, Mike Shanahan, said that Griese is a smarter signal-caller 
        than Steve Young and John Elway - two Hall-of-Fame QBs who played for 
        Shanahan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Griese proved his mettle by playing in the second of a game last season 
        against the Oakland Raiders in which he had suffered a third-degree shoulder 
        separation. Despite his knowledge of the game and his desire, Griese simply 
        lacks the talent and play-making ability to lead an imperfect team. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When the offense breaks down, Griese stumbles as evidenced by his 12 
        interceptions this season. While he has thrown 15 TDs and completed 64.3% 
        of his passes, he has yet to prove himself as a play-maker who can create 
        on his own.<br>
      </p>
      <p>His predecessor, John Elway, was at his very best when the offensive 
        game plan failed and the game necessitated originality. Elway's knack 
        to create offense coupled with his natural ability forced his teammates 
        to elevate their level of play.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Griese, on the other hand, depends on his teammates to his elevate his 
        play. He lacks the arm strength and physical ability to lead a team without 
        a strong supporting cast.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Here within lies the difference between Tom Brady and Brian Griese. Brady's 
        4-4 Patriots are a less-talented bunch than the Broncos - especially offensively. 
        However, Brady's physical talent and his play-making ability have elevated 
        his teammates' play.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Players like wide-receiver David Patten are making major contributions 
        and are largely responsible for New England's recent success. Griese has 
        not - and will not - unearth a David Patten in the Broncos roster.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Brian Griese does have a future in the NFL, however. Oddly enough, it 
        is with the New England Patriots. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Denver and Boston love making trades with each other in every sport - 
        except for football. Players like Raymond Bourque, Mike Lansing, Ron Mercer, 
        Tony Battie, and Chris Herren are only a few of the players who management 
        traded to either Denver or Boston.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If the Broncos trade one of their three 1000-yard rushers along with 
        Griese to New England, the Pats will have their first bonafide RB since 
        Curtis Martin as well as a great back-up QB.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In return, the Broncos receive Drew Bledsoe whose services are no longer 
        needed in New England. With Denver, Bledsoe will have the opportunity 
        to resurrect his career under the tutelage of Mike Shanahan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Within two years, the Broncos and the Patriots will be the two best teams 
        in the National Football League. A rivalry reminiscent of the 49'ers/Cowboys 
        competition of the the early '90s will ensue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If no deal is reached, the Broncos will continue to be a mediocre team 
        led by a mediocre quarterback. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And the Patriots? Internal strife between Bledsoe and Brady will slowly 
        tear apart the team. The Patriots will continue to be a mediocre team 
        pulled apart by two talented QBs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first Denver-New England football trade is in order.</p>
