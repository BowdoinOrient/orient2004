      <p>Growth for any student organization means changes, and the Bowdoin Cable 
        Network is no exception. It is perhaps the most visible and easy-to-access 
        of the venues of student creative work on campus, and the Cable Network 
        has gone through a number of changes since its inception in 1999. This 
        year marks several major additions in the programming schedule and goals 
        for the network. </p>

      <p>To find out exactly what has changed, and where the folks at the BCN 
        plan to take us over the next year, Nat Felsher, the general manager of 
        the station, and Matthew Volk, the assistant general manager in charge 
        of sports, discussed what's in store for Bowdoin students. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's like night and day,&quot; says Felsher of this year's BCN 
        over last year's. &quot;We've been building a base for two years, and 
        now things are starting to come together.&quot; The BCN's programming 
        lineup has a number of new premiers, including &quot;Bowdoin Cribs,&quot; 
        a spinoff of the MTV show, that will interview Bowdoin students and show 
        the dorm rooms in which they live. Other hopeful additions will be student-made 
        films, dating personals and even full-length feature films, an experiment 
        that garnered a &quot;great&quot; response when tried earlier this year. 
        And, of course, the long-running soap opera &quot;The Tower&quot; will 
        enter its third season, with more promises of the on-campus romance, treachery 
        and deceit that has made it popular.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But Felsher and Volk were most excited about the two new live shows that 
        will premier this year. &quot;Bare Essentials&quot; and &quot;Polar Pride&quot; 
        will premiere at 7:30 PM on Wednesdays and Thursdays, respectively. Presenting 
        these shows--live broadcasts, not taped--are a &quot;brand new idea&quot; 
        for the BCN, which is devoting much more of its programming effort into 
        creating live shows.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As for how the student body responds to these changes, the response has 
        been &quot;phenomenal,&quot; says Felsher. &quot;We've had people writing 
        and calling in with suggestions for the shows... a lot of people seem 
        to be sitting down and tuning in.&quot; The fan base is expected to increase 
        with the introduction of the new live shows and the general improvements 
        around the station.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So what exactly is the BCN planning for this year? As mentioned before, 
        more live television shows, in addition to expanded live coverage of sports 
        events is a major goal. Volk was enthusiastic about the possibilities 
        of live sports coverage, saying it was something that Bowdoin &quot;really 
        needs,&quot; and even suggesting the use of digital footage and streaming 
        internet video to broadcast games. Other goals for this year include creating 
        more continuity for such running shows as &quot;The Tower,&quot; which 
        are plagued by constantly-graduating actors and semester-to-semester changes 
        in cast. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're still learning as we go along,&quot; says Volk. &quot;[The 
        BCN's] real goal is to give students a creative outlet to express themselves... 
        we're well on our way.&quot;<br>
