      <p align="left">Wartime Bowdoin College was a mixture of a small liberal 
        arts school and military camp. At the opening of the College's wartime 
        summer session in June, 1943 President Sills noted there were 319 men 
        in the Army Air Corps, 183 in the Naval Unit and 150 undergraduates on 
        the Bowdoin campus. &quot;These figures,&quot; he said, &quot;show what 
        the war means to Bowdoin.&quot; Two months later he wrote:</p>
      <p align="left">
        A year ago on the campus there were 382 undergraduates and about 75 Naval 
        officers in the Radar School. Today there are 159 in the College proper 
        and about 500 in uniform, 180 in the Radar School and about 320 in the 
        Army Air Corps Pre-meteorological Unit. Before the end of the summer we 
        shall in all probability have another Army Unit of 175 to 200. Thus the 
        ratio which last summer was about five civilians to one in the armed forces 
        will be completely reversed. There will be five in the Army and the Navy 
        to every one in the College itself.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Indeed, as the war began, Bowdoin's campus changed to accommodate the 
        needs of the nation. As Sills and Dean Paul Nixon had told their undergraduates, 
        longing to get into the fight, the Armed Forces were in need of men who 
        could potentially become officers and thus, these boys should stay in 
        school to finish their degrees if they were not yet called up. Despite 
        Sills' and Nixon's pleas, many still volunteered for service. The draft 
        also took away many Bowdoin men-in mid-career. Other groups such as Air 
        Corps, Army, and Naval cadets took their places while the few applicants 
        to the actual college in those war years made up only a small fraction 
        of the campus population.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But keeping the College afloat was no easy task. While the Athletic Department 
        complied with the Government's suggested physical education program for 
        undergraduates-&quot;strictly enforced&#133;reach all men in the college&#133;include 
        real body building and conditioning exercises for a minimum of three hours 
        a week.&quot;-many in the U.S. began to question the need for a liberal 
        arts education in times of war. Bowdoin's faculty and administrators quickly 
        rose to defend their position. Speaking to Prof. Thomas C. Van Cleve, 
        Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs at Bowdoin College, an alumnus 
        and World War I veteran angrily declared, &quot;This is no time for college 
        as usual-we are at war. Why should my boy or any other college boy be 
        deferred? Why shouldn't the faculty itself get into it? College is all 
        right in peace time, but what right has a college such as Bowdoin to expect 
        to go on as usual?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Van Cleve responded via a four-page article published in the August 1942 
        Alumni magazine, The Bowdoin Alumnus. The professor observed that 80 percent 
        of officers had college degrees and that this was thus not a wasteful 
        education. To be more specific, he noted that Bowdoin had launched its 
        accelerated program and still had much to offer the nation in this crisis. 
        &quot;Students who possess unusual aptitude for languages are needed for 
        special training in the little known languages of the far flung regions 
        into which our armed forces have penetrated, or into which they may be 
        compelled to go as the war progresses.&quot; Furthermore:</p>
      <p align="left">
        &#133;the Army and Navy have become aware of the fact that the knowledge 
        of drill regulations, of automatic weapons, of tanks and mortars, is not 
        sufficient for the training of officers. There is an intangible quality, 
        generally described as &quot;leadership,&quot; which can be discovered 
        readily, if not actually developed, in the classroom, on the college athletic 
        field, or in the daily association of young men in their various college 
        activities. &#133; the discipline of college training, whatever the major 
        field may be, supplies a sound foundation upon which to continue the more 
        technical education of an officer.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Hinting at Bowdoin's traditional creed to make its students &quot;at home 
        in all lands,&quot; Van Cleve continued:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Never before in a great war has it been so essential that the leaders 
        of the armed forces of all the different countries, participating as allies, 
        have the capacity to understand and to adapt themselves to the point of 
        view and to the customs of allied peoples. The college trained man undoubtedly 
        has an advantage in undertaking this task. It has been the pride of Bowdoin 
        that it has tried to teach men &quot;to be at home in all lands.&quot; 
        In whatever measure we have succeeded in doing this, we have contributed 
        to the education of potential leaders.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Responding to the question, &quot;Why go to a Liberal Arts College in 
        war times and study Greek and Latin?&quot; Dean Paul Nixon responded:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Greek and Latin? At the present moment, 280 Bowdoin undergraduates are 
        studying Mathematics, 170 Physics, 210 Chemistry, 70 Astronomy, Meteorology, 
        Air Navigation, and Civil Air Regulations. Eleven are studying Greek; 
        twenty are studying Latin. And this handful of classicists are classicists, 
        in war times, mostly because they're mathematical morons-at least they 
        tell me so. Probably, they're right.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Dean continued:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Liberal Arts Colleges haven't taught Engineering. But they have taught 
        the Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, that are the basis of Engineering. 
        Three years at Bowdoin College&#133;are accepted as the equivalent of 
        two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for the proper 
        boy taking the proper courses, and such boys can get their degree and 
        ours in five years. Liberal Arts Colleges haven't taught Medicine or Dentistry. 
        But they have taught the Biology and other sciences that are demanded 
        for admission to Medical and Dental Schools. Liberal Arts colleges haven't 
        taught men how to run machines. But they have taught the things that make 
        machines run.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The War Department in Washington D.C. charged with the task of mobilizing 
        troops and planning strategy was of the same opinion as these professors: 
        liberal arts colleges still had their uses. As the war began, analysts 
        predicted not only a protracted conflict but also one which would require 
        many new replacements as casualties mounted. Infantrymen were, it was 
        assumed, easy enough to replace but trained officers, which were mostly 
        college graduates, would be harder to recruit, especially if the draft 
        age was lowered to encompass 18-year-olds-thus denying these kids from 
        even gaining a years experience in institutions of higher learning. To 
        this end, and after consultation with such noted university chiefs as 
        Harvard's James B. Conant, the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP) 
        and the Navy V-12 programs were created on December 17, 1942. These programs 
        provided officer candidates a chance to spend one to six three-month terms 
        in one of 227 (for the ASTP) or 131 (for V-12) colleges and universities, 
        nationwide. Eventually over 300,000 participants were enrolled in these 
        programs. The War Department's ASTP and V-12 also served the purpose of 
        trying to save small colleges, that were suffering from a lack of normal 
        applicants. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The two programs served their purposes well. Both men, who were already 
        in the service and those who had their high-school degrees and were between 
        the ages of 18-22 were eligible to participate. Run by different branches 
        of the Armed Forces (ASTP by the Army and V-12 by the Navy) these programs 
        still started up about the same time-ASTP was in session by April, 1943 
        and V-12 started in July of the same year. These stays in colleges and 
        universities, were by no means, a picnic. Demanding and rigorous courses 
        kept the men on their feet. Failure meant a return to the ranks and transfers 
        to combat units. Generally, these trainees were integrated into the college 
        communities and in the case of V-12, their future officers were allowed 
        to participate in both sports and local social functions. In the end, 
        the Navy's program survived the war-it had always received higher support 
        from the office of the Secretary of the Navy-while ASTP was cancelled 
        in February 18, 1944 due to a crunch in manpower. One hundred thousand 
        would-be officers were taken out of their institutions and many were sent 
        to the frontlines.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin College was lucky enough to play host to both programs as well 
        as a Radar School and the Army Air Corps' Pre-meteorological Unit. Khaki-clad 
        groups of men roamed the dormitories and science halls, congregated on 
        the Quad, paid respect at Bowdoin's Memorial Flagpole, and enjoyed the 
        offerings of the campus, whose sons were scattered around the world. Undoubtedly, 
        the income from these governmental programs helped the college to weather 
        the hardest months of the war, and also served to keep faculty and staff 
        members occupied through the year.</p>
