      <p align="left"> &quot;Yeah, you've got that something<br>
        I think you'll understand<br>
        When I feel that something<br>
        I wanna hold your hand&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        --The Beatles</p>
      <p> Holding hands is part of our very nature-we hold hands as we learn to 
        walk, we hold hands as we cross the street when we're very young, we hold 
        hands as we play &quot;Ring around the Rosie&quot; and many other times 
        as children. So why does it all of a sudden become so loaded when we grow 
        up? Earlier this semester I wrote about PDA, now let me get a little more 
        specific: I want to talk about HOLDING HANDS.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Holding hands, while requiring far less physical intimacy than a hookup, 
        may in fact be much more emotionally involving. For some reason, people 
        who have no problem being extremely intimate with someone cannot handle 
        what is associated with holding hands. There is, of course, the &quot;we 
        are leaving a party to hookup&quot; handhold, but this is far rarer than 
        awkwardly walking home together without touching, and usually the handhold 
        as foreplay to a random hookup is as meaningless as the hookup itself. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Carrie explains, &quot;When I leave a party with a guy and we're not holding 
        hands, I don't know if he's just going to leave me at my door or what. 
        If we are holding hands, it's a shoo-in. But it usually doesn't mean any 
        more than that he's definitely coming to my room for the night.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        On the other hand, Lauren laments, &quot;I've had boyfriends who couldn't 
        bring themselves to hold my hand in public! It's not like I'm asking them 
        to make out with me, but you'd think we'd be comfortable enough with each 
        other to make physical contact in front of other people.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Lauren is right-holding hands, when done inconspicuously, is a very nice 
        and sweet way to show affection without being obnoxious. But unfortunately, 
        at Bowdoin, as Jackie presciently observes, &quot;Physical affection is 
        pretty much taboo outside of really serious, long-term relationships or 
        under the pretense of being 'under the influence'&quot;.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Not that all girls are reaching for hands left and right-guys and girls 
        seem to be equally afraid of holding hands in public.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Katie explained that she just feels weird sometimes if she's holding hands 
        with her boyfriend and they walk into the union. &quot;I feel like everyone 
        thinks I'm being possessive or something.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Greg, who plays a contact sport involving a stick (and that's all I can 
        say about that, as I am sworn to secrecy), confides that he thinks people 
        see holding hands as crossing the unwritten line between being in a relationship 
        and &quot;the weekend scene&quot;. &quot;There's like this understanding 
        that you are somehow supposed to make a leap between the two extremes 
        without anyone else knowing. I don't really get it, but that's just the 
        way it is. If everyone [writer's note: everyone = other guys who play 
        contact sport involving a stick] saw me holding hands with some girl, 
        I'd never hear the end of it. Neither would she, for that matter. Don't 
        ask me why! I don't know!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Greg was quick to say he would love to care enough about a girl to want 
        to hold her hand, but that still doesn't mean he would actually do the 
        deed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Interestingly enough, there are actually documented incidents of people 
        at parties walking around holding hands together who don't actually know 
        each other and don't even go home together! As bizarre as this is, it 
        is, in some ways, an attempt at achieving intimacy, much like hooking 
        up, with a random person because you are lonely.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It seems to me that people at Bowdoin are too afraid to cross the very 
        line Greg was talking about. Maybe it has something to do with the fact 
        that we fear we will look like losers if we are seen holding hands with 
        someone in the broad daylight one day and the next night they hook up 
        with someone else. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Let me take it a little further: we are all high achievers here at Bowdoin 
        (you could try to disagree, but I would argue that whether it's academically, 
        athletically or otherwise, we all worked hard at something to get here) 
        and are clearly afraid of seeming like a failure-i.e., showing we like 
        someone where there is potential, however small, of being ultimately rejected.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I think if we all took ourselves a little less seriously and listed to 
        the Beatles, holding hands when we feel &quot;that something,&quot; perhaps 
        we could all lighten up a bit. I'm not saying everyone should walk around 
        hand in hand-if that's not your thing, then fine, and I've already declared 
        my own anti-PDA stance-but maybe it would be a good thing if we could 
        not put so much pressure on ourselves and were able to admit we liked 
        people without having to chalk it up to &quot;the weekend scene.&quot; 
        Most of us are here seven days a week you know.</p>
