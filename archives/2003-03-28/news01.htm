      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Student Government (BSG) voted Tuesday to lift 
        sanctions imposed by the Student Organizations Oversight Committee (SOOC) 
        on the campus' student humor publication, Ritalin. The BSG also voted 
        11-7 in favor of a new resolution that requires the publication to obtain 
        a faculty advisor to look over all material before printing. Though, discretion 
        is still left to the founders/Editors-in-Chief Jay Kang '02 and Eric Goldwyn 
        '03. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The overturned February 27 SOOC sanctions included limiting funding to 
        accomodate for a 12- page issue instead of the normal 16-page issue. In 
        addition, the sanctions required Ritalin to find a faculty advisor who 
        would have to sign off on all material before printing. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The original SOOC sanctions came as a result of several complaints about 
        the publication's offensive content. Chair of the SOOC Haliday Douglas 
        '05 said, &quot;Dean Bradley and Res. Life have seen concern about Ritalin 
        since its first publication last spring.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kang and Goldwyn appealed the SOOC sanctions at the Tuesday March 4 BSG 
        meeting, which included an hour-long discussion about the publication's 
        fate. Rushed by an impatient and enormous crowd (with scores forced to 
        listen from the Moulton Union lobby outside Lancaster Lounge) waiting 
        in anticipation of a heated debate about the Iraq resolution, the BSG 
        voted 21-4 in favor of a motion to temporarily lift the sanctions until 
        &quot;further investigation.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        After BSG President Jason Haffler '03 warned at 9:10 p.m. that the meeting 
        would end at 9:35 p.m. before the Iraq debate had even begun. The BSG 
        meeting ended up going on well past 10:00 p.m.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With a growing level of interest in the issue campus-wide, the Bowdoin 
        Cable Network (BCN) show BCN Raw, decided to feature a debate between 
        Douglas and Kang on Wednesday March 5, which aired live. Douglas said 
        of the March 4 meeting, &quot;If a BSG member called a motion to have 
        SOOC sanctions sustained instead of lifted until further investigation, 
        I think it could have passed as easily, because of the growing impatience 
        of the crowd.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Tuesday's &quot;further investigation&quot; included an hour and a half 
        discussion about the nature of Ritalin's content. Douglas, Goldwyn, and 
        Kang all sat before the BSG, going back and forth answering questions, 
        with Douglas often citing specific examples of &quot;offensive content.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact that not one spectator was present at the discussion, in contrast 
        to the massive crowd for the vote on the Iraq resolution March 4, certainly 
        allowed members to speak more openly about the issue. &quot;I use swear 
        words like that sometimes...It's different when they're directed at JLo 
        or Puff Daddy. Please be more specific in who they're offending,&quot; 
        said BSG Treasurer and Student Activities Funding Committee (SAFC) head 
        Tejas Ajmera '04. Laughter even broke out a few times among BSG members 
        as Douglas read some of the controversial content aloud, noting &quot;a 
        gay man's instructions on how to give a blow job.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Citing the usage of the terms &quot;faggot,&quot; &quot;pussy,&quot; and 
        &quot;whorebag,&quot; Douglas said, &quot;Homosexuals are a group on campus 
        that was offended. Even if it's not direct, it's still wrong just publishing 
        the words.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        BSG member Ed McKenzie '03 said to Douglas, &quot;Are you asking students 
        to be better than the very society we live in by sanitizing everything? 
        Then you could say that everything students do should be sanitized.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Goldwyn said, &quot;I don't think we're in left field in terms of pushing 
        the line. Maybe at Bowdoin.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        When BSG member Alex Cornell Du Houx '06 questioned whether the editors 
        feel the word &quot;queer-ass&quot; is as bad as &quot;nigger,&quot; Kang 
        said, &quot;Given the generation we grew up in, or at least for me coming 
        from the South, some of those words are just used without thinking twice. 
        They don't necessarily intend to be directly offensive. We just have to 
        trust the reader.&quot; Goldwyn said earlier, &quot;We don't cram it down 
        anyone's throats, it's just there to pick up.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While criticism of the publication's processes continued including citing 
        how the editors took students' faces off the Internet to use as mockery, 
        Kang said, &quot;We're not here to justify our cause, we are here to discuss 
        the flawed processes of the SOOC.&quot; Kang said, &quot;Our meeting with 
        the SOOC was more an interrogation process where every answer we had was 
        ignored.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Goldwyn agreed it was &quot;not a collaborative effort.&quot; He said, 
        &quot;Ritalin has not been read in its entirety and Hal has taken it out 
        of context. Jay and Hal have had a dicey relationship and they have even 
        gotten into a few shouting matches. Hal may not be the best guy to control 
        this.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Douglas said, &quot;Wonder why I didn't pick up Ritalin the first day 
        it came out. Why would I be out to get it now?&quot; Douglas further said, 
        &quot;It's hard to sit down with someone when you know every action of 
        yours is described as 'a bitch-ass thing to do.'&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Asked by McKenzie whether or not the extra four pages are &quot;just filler,&quot; 
        Goldwyn said, &quot;It's hard to fit other people's articles in to 12 
        pages and Jay and I have a lot of material that we want to use.&quot; 
        &quot;Slashing our budget by one quarter is serious,&quot; said Kang. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ritalin is primarily a two-person publication, which could add to the 
        SOOC's feelings about wanting to fund 12 pages instead of 16 per publication. 
        Douglas said, &quot;We had to turn down funding to a community service 
        trip recently. Funds are tight.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Before voting, many members agreed that putting the editors through all 
        the debate certainly opened their eyes to what content has proven bothersome 
        to parts of the community. Ajmera indicated that it was unlikely that 
        the Ritalin editors would publish such offensive content again after the 
        recent uproar. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Rushed once again, some BSG members claimed the meeting had gone past 
        schedule, saying they had to leave unless there was an immediate vote.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After the sanctions were overturned and the new resolution passed to require 
        Ritalin to obtain a faculty advisor (with discretion left to the editors), 
        Goldwyn said, &quot;We don't think Ritalin should be faculty advised. 
        It's a student publication of student voices.&quot; Goldwyn said, &quot;We 
        only have one or two issues left since we're both seniors and are going 
        to graduate.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the fate of Ritalin beyond Goldwyn and Kang's graduation remains 
        unknown, so remains the question of whether the SOOC and BSG procedures 
        will ultimately affect the publication's content, as final discretion 
        is still left to the editors. &quot;There won't be any big lash-out for 
        the next issue,&quot; said Goldwyn. &quot;Jay and I will continue to exercise 
        our best judgment. We listened to the SOOC and BSG, understand their concerns, 
        and will take them into account. We've bounced around a few names for 
        an advisor.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The editors are currently working on the content of the next issue, and, 
        according to Goldwyn, &quot;no content is offensive in our standards.&quot;
