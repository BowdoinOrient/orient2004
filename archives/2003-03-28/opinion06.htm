      <p align="left"> On Saturday, a small contingent of protestors gathered 
        outside the CNN headquarters in Atlanta chanting, &quot;CNN: War is not 
        a game.&quot; It is hard to know exactly what the protestors meant by 
        this criticism, considering that CNN is an all-news network and thus cannot 
        conflate its news broadcasts with sports games. </p>
      <p>CNN however did briefly address the protestors concerns in its coverage 
        Saturday night. Anchor Aaron Brown reminded viewers that CNN recognizes 
        that war coverage is not &quot;just another form of reality TV&quot; and 
        thus treats the subject with the utmost gravity. It is depressing if Brown 
        refuted the real concern of the protestors. However, if Brown was accurate, 
        the protesters have proven how damaging reality TV is: It encourages irresponsible 
        behavior to children and distracts adults from important civic topics. 
      </p>
      <p>I have never liked reality TV. I remember in the summer of 2000, when 
        &quot;Survivor&quot; first graced the airwaves, that I was almost oblivious 
        to its existence until I returned to campus in late August and nearly 
        half of Quinby House couldn't wait to watch the final episode. I did not 
        see the appeal of watching people deceive, cheat, and backstab others 
        in an effort to win money. In addition, there seemed to be nothing &quot;real&quot; 
        about it. How is going to a desert island and having one's every move 
        watched and edited by TV crews anything close to reality? </p>
      <p>This past summer of course brought the American viewing public even more 
        voyeuristic possibilities. Shows such as &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; &quot;The 
        Bachelorette,&quot; and &quot;Meet My Folks&quot; trivialized love and 
        romance entirely in the interests of acquiring advertising money. Soon 
        after those shows came CNN's Jeff Greenfield, apparently as a way of tempering 
        angry conservatives, who reminded viewers that such sensationalized entertainment 
        long pre-dates the television. I recall him mentioning 20th and early 
        20th century circus performances that showed bearded women, midgets, and 
        other bizarre spectacles whose purposes were limited to &quot;shock&quot; 
        and make money. </p>
      <p>I agree that Greenfield has a point. Critics should not speak as if these 
        sordid spectacles of entertainment are unheard of. However, historical 
        precedent does not preclude these programs from criticism. One can still 
        criticize reality TV for its effect on our population, primarily and specifically 
        on our youth. It is distressing to see how few people have seriously asked 
        what effect seeing people eat worms, betray friendships, or have &quot;hookup&quot; 
        relations has on adolescent behavior. Just as criticizing the government 
        in time of war is not &quot;unpatriotic,&quot; being critical of television 
        producers for displaying gratuitously disgusting images on TV is neither 
        &quot;prude,&quot; &quot;puritan,&quot; nor the truly nasty &quot;fascist.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>It is only common sense that young people learn acceptable behavior from 
        examples that they encounter not only at home and in the neighborhood, 
        but also on television and in movies. This inundation with reality TV 
        can not only influence behavior but can also obfuscate from the eyes of 
        our youth what is in fact &quot;real&quot; and what deserves attention 
        and serious thinking. The protests outside CNN show also that this distorted 
        image of reality may not only be limited to youth; apparently some adults 
        have misconstrued fiction for fact. </p>
      <p>Perhaps I am misunderstanding what the protestors really meant by their 
        complaint to CNN. Regardless, it is unfortunate that there is even a hint 
        of the idea that reality TV has desensitized us to what truly deserves 
        our attention. The suggestion adds to the already lengthy list of reasons 
        that concerned Americans should turn off reality TV that could not be 
        more unreal. Instead, we should focus ourselves on &quot;reality:&quot; 
        the men and women who are placing themselves in harm's way to make our 
        country and world safer. </p>
      <p>In that sense, perhaps war is the ultimate reality TV, and we should 
        praise CNN and all other news outlets for reminding Americans of the stark, 
        unjust, and often cruel conditions that define &quot;the real world&quot;-absent 
        MTV.<br>
