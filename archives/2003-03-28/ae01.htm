        <font size="2">MAIA-CHRISTINA LEE</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">I tried not to be distracted by all the naked people walking 
        around but they were part of the show. They were just like the crickets, 
        the techno, and the line at the keg-a small piece in what was a very non-Bowdoin, 
        non-Kresge, non-anything-that-had-been-done-before art event. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We wanted to ruffle a few feathers and shake things 
        up,&quot; said Lily Alt '03, one of the hosts of Splat!, an art show that 
        took place on Wednesday night. &quot;We felt like it was time to habituate 
        the un-art part of Bowdoin to what art can be like.&quot; Annie Blair 
        '03, whose work appeared in the fishbowl, had similar sentiments. &quot;We 
        wanted Bowdoin to appreciate the male and female form more than they do. 
        It's good to expose people to interactive art.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        At Splat! the exposed interacted with the unexposed, students interacted 
        with computer animation and crickets hopped around inside a glass case 
        watching the entire event unfold. Splat! proved that Bowdoin can sometimes 
        surprise you-even if many of the nude models were in fact members of the 
        track team</p>
      <p align="left">
        All of the artwork at the show was done by four senior artists: Lily Alt, 
        Annie Blair, Katie Shaughnessy, and Jaica Kinsman. From prints to paintings 
        to videos and ceramics, Kresge was filled with art of every sort. There 
        were self-portraits and abstract collages, large canvases and tiny drawings. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The show is sort of like an ADD dream,&quot; said Blair. &quot;We 
        wanted to overload the senses by putting art everywhere.&quot; Most of 
        the art was chosen based on the individual preferences of the artists. 
        They wanted to display the highlights of the work they did during their 
        time at Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kinsman's work included several 3D computer animations as well as a video 
        montage entitled &quot;ADD.&quot; Images of crickets being dissected were 
        linked together with shots of the artist as well as footage from the preparation 
        of the show. The video was projected onto the bodies of three dancing 
        models whose naked bodies were painted white. Two were female and one 
        was male. The females wore nothing but white bathing caps and danced continuously 
        throughout the duration of the show. Though they were facing the wall, 
        they attracted a crowd of artists and non-artists alike.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Katie Shaugnessy's collages, which also hung in the basement of Kresge, 
        were colorful assemblages of bright tissue paper in a variety of abstract 
        patterns. They added to the lively and chromatic atmosphere where even 
        the walls were altered from their traditional wash of white. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Swirls of color stretched across the basement of Kresge mixing together 
        to create the human form. These patterns of color were echoed in the body 
        paint covering some of the naked models. Posing in a variety of shapes, 
        the models did their best to blend in with the wall while a crowd of students 
        mingled amongst the works of art. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The written word was also a big part of the show. Painted onto the wall 
        where the models were posing were the words &quot;Through Life's Blood. 
        Through My Pigment.&quot; Upstairs in the fishbowl, Annie Blair's artwork 
        featured many of her own words which were written alongside her drawings 
        and paintings. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a backdrop to Blair's work, the walls of the fishbowl were painted 
        bright red. &quot;It was good to get rid of the drab white,&quot; said 
        Alt, whose work was also displayed in the fishbowl. With two large speakers 
        and a table full of colorful candy and streamers, the fishbowl was anything 
        but drab during Wednesday night's show.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The event, which marked the last night of the art show (all the work was 
        taken down at 10:00 p.m.) also happened to fall on Jaica Kinsman's birthday. 
        A celebration, complete with cake, candles, and singing, was all part 
        of the show. The naked models brought out birthday cakes while a crowd 
        of students and parents sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Kinsman. </p>
      <p align="left">
        When asked how he felt about being naked in front of the Bowdoin community, 
        Henry Perry-Friedman '06 said he just didn't think about it. Dave Donnelly 
        '03 had similar feelings saying &quot;it's been fun.&quot; And it certainly 
        was. Though the artwork in Splat! came down at the end of the night, it 
        is a show that will not soon be forgotten.</p>
