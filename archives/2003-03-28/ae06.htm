      <p align="left">Everyone at some point has wanted a &quot;recommendation 
        shelf&quot; because everyone at some point believes that they are best 
        represented by their tastes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So, pile on The Dubliners so the customers think you're smart, Anais Nin 
        so they know that you're down for sex, The Cat in the Hat Comes Back so 
        they can witness your inner child, not to mention your devotion to sequels, 
        and maybe something edgy like Jesus' Son to flash your tragic, misunderstood 
        tendencies. You could put post-it notes on the jacket cover with nice 
        notes like, &quot;Made me laugh, cry, laugh, listen to Mariah Carey and 
        laugh again.&quot; For the most part, recommendation shelves are a nice, 
        quiet form of self-expression. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nick Hornby's latest release Songbook tries to be the literary form of 
        the recommendation shelf. At the urging of the McSweeney's press, Hornby 
        compiled thirty-one of his favorite songs and wrote short essays on his 
        personal relationship with each song. You learn that he loves Nelly Furtado 
        and Bruce Springsteen and that he thinks that you can hear the voice of 
        God in Rufus Wainwright's &quot;One-Man Guy.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        As you read, Hornby dives deeper into himself and pulls out anecdotes 
        to go with songs, till by the end you're confused as to whether you're 
        reading a book on music or a book on Nick Hornby. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So, unlike the recommendation shelf, which serves both to humanize merchandise 
        and to promote sales, Hornby's book is useful to no one other than himself. 
        It is self-indulgent where it should be thoughtful and instead of unfolding 
        as an enjoyable, light read, it gets bogged down in self-pity and self-importance. 
        Hornby is the unapologetic music snob who is all in a huff about his &quot;narcotic 
        need&quot; to hear certain songs that have iconic importance in his life. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Didn't Nick Hornby already write this book? Wasn't it turned into a movie 
        starring John Cusack, Jack Black and some unidentifiable blonde lady with 
        bad teeth? Wasn't High Fidelity about the harrowing life of a self-obsessed 
        music snob who spends a discomforting amount of effort explaining his 
        &quot;special&quot; relationship with pop music? Why did Nick Hornby bother 
        writing another book on music and the girls that dumped him? High Fidelity 
        comes on Comedy Central eight times a week now, why should we still care? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The answer is I don't know because I don't understand the point of this 
        book or the eleven song CD that accompanies it. If it's to expose people 
        to music they may not have heard, then why are most of Hornby's selections 
        about radio-stuffing artists like Nelly Furtado, Rod Stewart, Led Zeppelin 
        and the Beatles? If it's to analyze the way in which people identify with 
        certain songs, then there should be a wider range of survey takers than 
        Nick Hornby. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If the book was written, as I suspect it was, to glorify one man's musical 
        tastes, then I think the book is a bad idea because a) Nick Hornby is 
        no musical expert, and b) who cares what songs Nick Hornby likes or dislikes? 
        To illustrate my point better, I'll include a page out of Jay Kang's Songbook. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Cure: &quot;Friday I'm in Love&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;When Robert Smith sings 'Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous 
        sight to see you eat in the middle of the night, you can never get enough.' 
        I remember how my girlfriend in high school would sometimes call me at 
        three in the morning. I'd pick up the phone and there'd be a pause before 
        her muffled voice would go, 'Hold on, I'm eating.' Then she'd laugh and 
        I could picture her on a stool in a dark kitchen, shaving slices off a 
        cheddar block and eating them off the dull edge of the knife. I was seventeen 
        and this song was always on the radio and whenever I heard that sparkly 
        piano the Cure uses in the song's first bars, I'd turn it up and start 
        grinning like I'd just won the lotto. Now, I have different associations.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Has this helped out your knowledge of music or your understanding of people? 
        Hopefully not. Of course, all of this is anticipated by Hornby, who comes 
        up with the appropriate amount of self-effacing and self-conscious disclaimers 
        throughout his text. </p>
      <p align="left">
        About twenty pages in, it becomes obvious that writing Songbook was a 
        guilty, self-indulgent pleasure for Hornby and that at times the guilt 
        gets to him. (Although, it's worth noting that almost all of Hornby's 
        books are unashamedly about himself and his obsessions.) He sort of apologizes 
        for liking Rod Stewart while sort of proclaiming that one can hear the 
        voice of God in a Rufus Wainwright song. The latter is a very stupid thing 
        to say and Hornby knows it but refuses to censor himself.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I blame all of this on Dave Eggers. His company, McSweeney's, commissioned 
        and distributed Songbook and it was Eggers' first novel, A Hearbreaking 
        Work of Staggering Genius that really opened the floodgates for self-obsession 
        to become the new literary vogue. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Songbook fits in perfectly with this &quot;My neurosis is beautiful and 
        gosh darn it, people want to read me&quot; movement. Which is fine in 
        theory but gets old after a while. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you talked to anyone and all they talked about was how much they loved 
        Chicken Cordon Bleu, the Red Sox and Weezer and how much they hated that 
        stupid kid in their English class, you'd probably get bored of him, too. 
        Songbook fails mostly because it is self-referential and self-important, 
        but it also suffers from a severe lack of balls and the culprit undoubtedly 
        is what dooms most recommendation shelves to predictability. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Anyone who has assembled one in their mind knows that your tastes are 
        a way of expressing yourself, but most of the time it has nothing to do 
        with you, but with how you want people to view your tastes and how that 
        might boost your people-like-me quotient. You boot that nice book with 
        the protagonist that reminds you of your sister and wedge in Sylvia Plath, 
        a biography of Johnny Cash, Ulysses and Irvine Welsh. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Hornby no doubt felt this self-conscious pull and what resulted is a cutesy, 
        boring list of songs in which each selection stinks of effort and affectation 
        (In High Fidelity, the protagonist once explains, &quot;It's not who you 
        are, it's what you like.&quot;) </p>
      <p align="left">
        Would you tolerate your Bull Moose clerk putting Nelly Furtado on his 
        shelf just because he thought it would show some girls that he was an 
        open-minded, fun-loving guy? No, you'd think he was annoying and probably 
        the type of guy who pretends to like Sex and the City and the New York 
        Football Giants at the same time. The sort of revulsion you feel for that 
        guy is exactly how you should react to Songbook. </p>

      <p>My fifteen-year-old cousin: 3 stars out of 5</p>
      <p>My cousin used to be the man. He was ten back then and he came to visit 
        me in North Carolina. Right when he got off the plane, he taught me this 
        dance move called the Crazy Duck Walk where you take a very small person 
        and drag them through your legs. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I dragged him all over the baggage claim till his black pants turned into 
        dust pants. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He was pretty good at basketball, too, and kept getting pissed off at 
        me because he knew that I was letting him win. One morning, before the 
        humidity really set in, he hit twelve straight shots from the three point 
        line that my Dad and I painted onto our driveway. When I drove him places, 
        he stuck his head out the window and howled.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now he's all big and is into computers. I saw him over break and tried 
        to do the Crazy Duck Walk with him, but he's fifteen now and is into questioning 
        the sexual orientation of people who try to pull him through their legs. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        I asked him how high school was and he told me that his friends all smoke 
        pot but he doesn't. I said, &quot;I've heard that one before,&quot; and 
        he said, &quot;Yeah, I'm sure you have,&quot; to which I said, &quot;I 
        have. I just told you that I had.&quot; He responded by once again questioning 
        my sexual orientation. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I asked him if he wanted to play basketball and he brightened up and said, 
        &quot;You have a Playstation here?&quot; I wanted to drain all the blood 
        out of his body, put it in a zip-lock bag and freeze out any connection 
        it might have to me. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I asked my mother and she said, &quot;I hope it's just a stage,&quot; 
        which when said by an aunt is the equivalent of, &quot;My sister must 
        have smoked some big crack rocks to pop out that little turd.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        I agreed but then I started talking to him and I remembered how much it 
        sucked to be fifteen. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It must be especially hard to be fifteen now, what with this internet 
        garbage and ecstasy going on everywhere and all this business about Iraq.<br>
