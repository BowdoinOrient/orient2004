      <p align="left"><font size="5">Playing with fire: censorship</font></p>
      <p align="left"> In the close-knit environment that is a small liberal arts 
        college, publications pushing the boundaries of humor will inevitably 
        elicit controversy. Clearly there was some questionable material in the 
        most recent issue of Ritalin; however, the Orient commends Bowdoin Student 
        Government for reversing a decision that would have clearly set a dangerous 
        precedent regarding the control of content in student publications. Despite 
        the content of any campus publication, be it Ritalin, the Orient, or any 
        school-funded periodical, good judgment should be left to the discretion 
        of the editors. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a student-run publication, the Orient is deeply invested in maintaining 
        solitary control over the content of these pages. While the Orient feels 
        that there are benefits to the faculty advisor system that is an integral 
        part of the student organization system, the role of the faculty advisor 
        should be limited to advising, and not controlling what is run in the 
        pages of various campus publications. For this reason, the SOOC's initial 
        decision to require that all of Ritalin's material be run by the scrutinizing 
        eyes of an advisor borders upon excessive censorship and would have completely 
        defeated the purpose of vesting the power of the press in the hands of 
        Bowdoin students. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As Bowdoin students, we are responsible enough to be held accountable 
        for our own discretionary decisions. Let the Ritalin editors answer to 
        their readership and not to the whims of a select few.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Don't leave seniors out to dry</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Don't be confused: You're in good hands with Allstate, 
        not Bowdoin College. In less than two months, the Class of 2003 will celebrate 
        its graduation while simultaneously being ushered quickly out the door. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        With its unfortunate policy, the College demands that students exit their 
        four-year home just eight hours after graduation ceremonies begin. The 
        6:00 cut-off will, as usual, force hundreds of students and family members 
        to make a hasty departure from underneath the pines. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin's administration must change this procedure and allow seniors 
        ample time for packing and celebrating one of the most important days 
        of their lives. Not only is it unnecessary for May 24 to become a veritable 
        stampede, but the prevention of this is well within Bowdoin's grasp: 12 
        hours...the dictator of a tyrannical regime got 12 years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like a broken relationship without a parting hug, the College will leave 
        seniors bitter when they should and could be relishing in the last few 
        hours after a crammed and stressful last month. As a very small college, 
        Bowdoin can not claim that a shortly prolonged stay would truly affect 
        summer schedules-it has nothing to lose from doing so.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It seems that the administration has become quite comfortable with leaving 
        students hanging. Not just at the end of the year, but every semester. 
        In December, individuals forced to stick around for Saturday finals were 
        faced with a lack of school attention. Moulton Union, the one dining hall 
        open, served an insubstantial brunch for less than three hours. The Cafe, 
        Polar Express, and Jack McGee's did not open once and Smith Union had 
        a late start at 10:00 a.m. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For a large contingency to be left with no on-campus sustenance at a time 
        when each hour counts most is unacceptable. Simply because class is over 
        and students will soon be on break is not a viable excuse for the lack 
        of resources and opportunities. Conveniently, the polar points left on 
        their cards were unused. Test-takers were left trying to coordinate travel 
        arrangements with a simple meal and cup of coffee, just as they'll scramble 
        for a duffel bag and extra trunk space.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Both cases are clean-cut examples of decisions made in detachment from 
        campus needs and display a lack of recognition towards the school's number 
        one priority: its students. Bowdoin's administration has more than enough 
        time to alter their inexcusable final days policy. Leave students with 
        the feeling that they're moving on from a close relationship and not that 
        we're on the wrong end of a business transaction. </p>
