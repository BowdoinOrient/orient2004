        <font size="2">BRYANT ANTHONY RICH</font><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> It has been several days since the start of the war in 
        Iraq. The President has had his way. We have spent much of the last year 
        quarrelling over the legitimacy of this war. There is evidence in support 
        of it and evidence against it. I have been skeptical from the start, but 
        I believe that it is now time to support our troops even if we disagree 
        with the policies that they are the tool of, hope for a quick victory, 
        and address a more pressing question: how will this war affect the American 
        people? </p>
      <p align="left">
        I would like to address this question by examining three aspects of a 
        post-Saddam America: President Bush's reelection, domestic sentiment toward 
        the war, and the war's effect upon United States' international image. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The war will be a hit or miss for the President. If our armed forces are 
        victorious and the President is successful in maintaining the war on terrorism 
        as the major issue going into the next election, he will be a shoo-in. 
        If the post-war regime change looks bleak and costly, Bush will pay dearly 
        at the polls. Everyone likes to win a war, but no one wants to feel burdened 
        by it. With our ever increasing deficit spending and mounting war costs, 
        not to mention post-war nation building costs, which we will surely pay 
        the vast majority of, we should anticipate significantly exacerbated fiscal 
        troubles for the federal government and debts that our generation will 
        be paying in taxes for the foreseeable future. If the war is resolved 
        too soon, we become embedded in the reconstruction process during prime 
        campaign time, and the democrats succeed in making our nations finances 
        a major campaign issue, the President should expect to encounter difficulty 
        in seeking reelection. </p>
      <p align="left">
        What effect will the war have upon domestic attitudes toward it? It is 
        my opinion that it will do little to sway most people's opinions, whether 
        they are pro-war, anti-war or of a moderate leaning to either stance. 
        If we overwhelm the Iraqi's quickly, pro-war hawks will continue to sing 
        the same song they have been singing for a year. People against the war 
        did not have qualms with our ability to win it so their opinions are unlikely 
        to change. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The only people whose opinions will likely be affected by the war are 
        moderates with limited knowledge of the war. They will be more likely 
        to adopt a pro-war stance if we win, seeing the victory as a signal of 
        legitimacy, and more likely to adopt an antiwar stance if we lose, seeing 
        the loss as a sign of an improper use of force.</p>
      <p align="left">
        No matter what the outcome of the war, our international image is unlikely 
        to improve. The world seems to view the United States as an untamable 
        hegemony, a bully. While it would be difficult to deny that our unparalleled 
        military force has gone to our heads it is unfair to see our call to arms 
        as being too completely illegitimate whether or not one agrees with our 
        motivations. The United States is a sovereign nation as are all members 
        of the United Nations. We are entitled to take unilateral actions even 
        if they are intensely unpopular. Nations violate U.N. resolutions constantly, 
        and despite France's strong objections to our use of force against Saddam, 
        it is undeniable that they had economic interests consistent with Saddam 
        maintaining power in Iraq. Also, we must be fair in our judgment of the 
        United States; if France or any other nation were in the United States' 
        position of power they would most likely take actions that would result 
        in their being perceived as bullying other nations. The situation with 
        Iraq is not the first time that European nations have been critical of 
        the U.S. but more often than not they usually end up capitulating with 
        our wishes anyway as they are normally in their interest. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Saddam Hussein is and has always been a problem, even when we supported 
        him. The War will most likely rid us of him. Is war the best course of 
        action? This remains to be seen. It is reasonable to be skeptical of the 
        President's motivations. Whether or not our intentions are truly altruistic 
        or not will be put to the test in postwar Iraq. Will we remain in Iraq 
        until we have fully and properly healed Iraq's political wounds or will 
        the president withdraw our forces when nation building goes out of fashion 
        politically? No matter what the outcome, we must be cautious of giving 
        the president too much credit for a win. No matter who the President is 
        it seems safe to say that our military force would easily overwhelm that 
        of any third world dictatorship.</p>
