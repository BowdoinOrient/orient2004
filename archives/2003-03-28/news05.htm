      <p align="left">Forty years from now, a group of prominent historians will 
        unplug their cars from rooftop chargers and power out to Radcliffe to 
        argue, over bad coffee, which of the hundreds of thousands of recently 
        deceased women deserve to be included in the latest installment of Notable 
        American Women. And they will look twice at the lady who spent most of 
        the early twenty-first Century huddled in the Library of Congress, focusing 
        her hands on knitting and her ears on Depression-era radio interviews, 
        who read obituaries as most would the want ads, searching for that &quot;special 
        spark.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        But this particular woman, who spends her leisure time writing and lecturing 
        at Harvard, won't be included in the anthology anytime soon. First of 
        all, she's still alive. Second, she has a whopping conflict of interest. 
        She heads its admissions committee.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The editor for the next volume of Schlesinger Library's biographical dictionary 
        Notable American Women, Susan Ware, spoke at Bowdoin March 4.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ware argued that biography is a critically important form of &quot;doing 
        History,&quot; particularly when the subject is women's history.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The struggle for a career, the decision not to marry, the challenge 
        of pursuing a satisfying personal life at the same time as a job,&quot; 
        she said, combined to make the years of many working women, like the radio 
        host Mary Margaret McBride, more difficult-but also more interesting. 
        &quot;The personal story of these women must be told as a critical component 
        of their lives as a whole.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The key to understanding Molly Dewson, a New Deal politician and feminist 
        Ware has studied extensively, was discovering how the 52-year relationship 
        she maintained with another woman shaped her own life. &quot;Dewson made 
        virtually every decision, both political and professional, on the basis 
        of how it would affect her partner Polly Porter&quot; she said. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Another woman included in the newest dictionary, set for publishing in 
        2005, married seven times. Many looked to chosen, rather than biological 
        families, for support. Several chose not to marry. Of those who did, the 
        author said half did not have children. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For Ware, a challenge of editing Notable American Women, the fifth volume, 
        which will cover individuals who died after 1976, is resisting the temptation 
        to impose contemporary standards of sexual orientation on the subjects. 
        She said it would be easy to label two women who lived together lesbians, 
        but might misinterpret the nature of the relationship. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ware has covered women's history and feminism extensively, researching 
        and writing several books, most notably Still Missing: Amelia Earhart 
        and the Search for Modern Feminism and Beyond Suffrage: Women in the New 
        Deal, a collection of biographies of 28 women who gained political power 
        in the age of the Roosevelts. She has also co-authored a textbook, America's 
        History.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the editor of the next edition of Notable American Women, Ware said 
        she is trying to overcome several oversights of the previous volumes, 
        some less obvious than others. She is concerned about eliminating the 
        East Coast bias. The book is on target for having 25 percent minority 
        subjects and will give special emphasis to women who were notable, but 
        not necessarily famous. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For the first time, she said, First Ladies are not an &quot;automatic 
        admit.&quot; The volume will have 492 women, each chosen for the individual's 
        influence on her time and field, her innovations and the relevance of 
        her story to American women's history.</p>
      <p align="left">
        One of the key points of telling these women's tales, she said, is helping 
        the next generation learn how to integrate personal and professional lives.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;What we are doing is compiling shoulders,&quot; she said. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ware is confident that the next generation will have quite a view.</p>
