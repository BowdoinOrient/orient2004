        <font size="2">MONICA GUZMAN<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Ah, the Oscars. The fashion designer's ultimate runway, 
        the film industry's glitzy year-end banquet, the movie fanatic's Superbowl. 
        This is the quintessence of Hollywood's dream landscape-a place and time 
        where the stars shine at their brightest and truest, where we common folks 
        sneak a peek at the human beings behind our esteemed screen idols as they 
        are honored for their contributions to film. The Oscars are neither a 
        snobbish costume party nor a commemoration of triviality, but a time-honored 
        American celebration of art brimming with talent and reflecting on the 
        industry's undeniable influence on our lives. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But this year things were different. There were no red carpet interviews 
        before the show. Joan and Melissa Rivers, those half-wit Hollywood hags 
        of fashion, were cooped up in a studio interviewing journalists and stylists 
        instead, clearly bored out of their minds. Bird's-eye cameras gave us 
        a distant look at the arrivals. We could barely see Diane Lane's beautiful 
        beige gown, billowing in feathers at the skirt, Julianne Moore's green 
        robe that made the actress an antique porcelain doll, and Rene&eacute; 
        Zellweger in her ravishing, jazzy red sensation. I found myself trying 
        to read lips. Hollywood had hit the mute button. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But once the ceremony began and the winners were announced, that was no 
        longer the case. Not by a long shot. Not willing to let the opportunity 
        slide, some stars, Oscars in hand, cried out for peace. Whether met by 
        a standing ovation (Adrien Brody: &quot;Whether it's God or Allah, may 
        he watch over you and we pray for a swift resolution&quot;) or many cheers 
        with some loud boos (Michael Moore: &quot;We live in a time where we have 
        fictitious election results that elect a fictitious president. We live 
        in a time where we have a man who's sending us to war for fictitious reasons&quot;), 
        their comments reminded us that not even those behind our nation's most 
        escapist industry can escape war. None of us can.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But as for Hollywood itself, it continues in its quest to make us feel 
        good, no matter what's going on in the world. Chicago, the &quot;really 
        good movie everybody likes,&quot; to quote host Steve Martin, took home 
        six Oscars out of a possible 13. Thankfully, these didn't include two 
        of the three that I announced would make me walk out on the show: Queen 
        Latifah for Best Supporting Actress and John C. Reilly for Best Supporting 
        Actor. Not that I would have actually walked out, but it was fun to say 
        so. Catherine Zeta-Jones, a far more deserving candidate, did get Best 
        Supporting Actress. The woman can sing, as she proved in her live performance 
        of &quot;I Move On,&quot; nominated for Best Song. Unfortunately, she 
        couldn't show off her dancing skills, what with her grandfather's-err-Michael 
        Douglas's second baby very much on the way.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Chicago also picked up awards in costume design, art direction, film editing, 
        and sound. Impressive in the film world, but nobody else cared. After 
        all, no celebrities went up to the podium, just very talented people. 
        Ahem. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Then, after three and a half hours, it got the most predictable award 
        of the night, Best Picture. It's been the frontrunner since the nominations 
        were announced. The cast and crew of the film still acted surprised, though, 
        out of politeness to The Hours and The Pianist seating sections.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Come to think of it, that latter Holocaust war film should not be too 
        bitter; The Pianist managed to pull off three awards few saw coming: Best 
        Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Director. Adrien Brody was the 
        only nominee in the Best Actor pack to have never won or been nominated 
        for an Oscar before. Although his performance in The Pianist was hardly 
        easy and certainly moving, many thought this would be Jack's fourth or 
        Daniel Day-Lewis's second. Though Adrien was as shocked as the rest of 
        the world, he did have enough sense to grab presenter Halle Berry and 
        get a whopper of a kiss instead of the usual polite peck-and-hug. Later 
        he said it was part of her &quot;gift basket.&quot; Judging by the look 
        on Halle's face, she didn't know it. Don't think her husband was too happy 
        either. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Best Director award caused a scene in itself because its recipient, 
        Roman Polanski, is more or less banned from the country; if he steps foot 
        on our soil, he'll be arrested for having had sex with a thirteen-year-old 
        girl. Many thought that despite his enormous talent, such conduct would 
        make him unpopular with Academy voters. Apparently not. After that award, 
        the last one Gangs of New York had a good shot at, director Martin Scorsese 
        and the rest of the cast and crew called it a night. Ten nominations and 
        they didn't win a thing. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other films were a bit luckier. The Hours didn't get too much-certainly 
        less than it deserved-but Nicole Kidman did beat out Julianne Moore to 
        win Best Actress for her role as Virginia Woolf. Steve Martin couldn't 
        get away from making fun of the role's fake nose. &quot;Nicole Kidman 
        has worn a fake nose in every one of her movies,&quot; he said, &quot;except 
        for The Hours.&quot; Like most or all Best Actresses in the past, she 
        cried at the podium. How cute.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Frida managed two awards, although one, Best Makeup, was kind of a steal 
        as it was only running against (chuckle) The Time Machine, a silly summer 
        popcorn flick whose nomination must have been some kind of sick joke on 
        the part of the Academy. Otherwise, Frida also took away Best Score. Road 
        to Perdition won Best Cinematography, and Adaptation, which clearly deserved 
        far more recognition, did get Chris Cooper some clout finally as Best 
        Supporting Actor, so people could see who he was and go, &quot;Oh, it's 
        that guy&#133;from that movie&#133;he has a name.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        I had also smugly announced that I would leave the premises if Bowling 
        for Columbine didn't get Best Documentary. Not that I've seen any of the 
        other nominees, or have a particularly well-informed opinion, but the 
        odds that any of those were better than this are slim to none. Michael 
        Moore's picture did win, to thunderous applause and a standing ovation, 
        which he quickly turned into a mix of cheers and jeers with his acceptance 
        speech. Ah well. Could've seen it coming.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Besides glitz, glamour, and Roman Polanski, something else was conspicuously 
        absent from the ceremony: Eminem. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; was the only 
        song that wasn't performed during the ceremony. Then, of course, it won. 
        Eminem sent some random guy to accept the award on his behalf. So, we 
        could have had rap at the Oscars, but nooooo. Marshall was too busy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But heck-all's fair in Hollywood and war, and the show must inevitably 
        go on. After everyone rolled their eyes at Chicago as they came back to 
        their seats, Daniel Day-Lewis and Martin Scorsese sobbed in each other's 
        arms, Halle Berry ran backstage for some mouthwash, and teamsters loaded 
        Michael Moore into the trunk of an unmarked van, 20 million American families 
        yawned and turned off their TVs, and Hollywood called it a year. </p>
