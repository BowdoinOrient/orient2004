        <font size="2">BEN KREIDER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> The idea of the &quot;Bowdoin Bubble&quot; has long been 
        pervasive on campus. It is difficult to avoid encountering the phrase 
        regularly. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of truth to claims that 
        many students are apathetic when it comes to politics. The Bowdoin Coalition 
        Against the War in Iraq (BCAWI) deserves a great deal of credit for changing 
        the campus political landscape.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This dedicated group of students collected over 900 signatures in support 
        of an anti-war resolution they presented to the Bowdoin Student Government 
        (BSG). While the resolution failed to pass at the first meeting at which 
        it was presented, it passed during the week preceding spring break.</p>
      <p align="left">
        No matter what one's personal views are, it is clear that this grassroots 
        campaign was unusual. Never known for being a hotbed of political activism, 
        Bowdoin has justly developed a reputation as a place where the majority 
        of students care little about the world outside their cozy little cocoon 
        in the safe confines of Brunswick. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact that a fairly small, vocal group of students were committed enough 
        to start a petition is astounding. The fact that they convinced over half 
        of the student body to sign the petition is downright revolutionary.</p>
      <p align="left">
        An appalling number of students do not bother to vote in either campus 
        student government elections, let alone state or federal elections; therefore, 
        the fact that so many students chose to sign this petition gives hope 
        for the student body.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps Bowdoin will become the new Wesleyan, an activist utopia where 
        students passionately argue about politics in the dining hall and regularly 
        protest the social injustices in the world. While this scenario may seem 
        absurd, it is much more realistic now than it would have been years ago. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The simple act of setting up a table in Smith Union and collecting signatures 
        stimulated an impressive amount of debate and left students actually discussing 
        the war in the dining hall and in their dorms. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For once, many students seemed to actually care about something other 
        than their grades or getting wasted on the weekend. A year ago, I had 
        difficulty finding anyone who cared enough to discuss a possible war in 
        Iraq. Several weeks ago, it was difficult to go anywhere and not hear 
        about Iraq.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Students on both sides of this issue should appreciate what the BCAWI 
        has done for campus life. In response to the anti-war movement, those 
        in support of the war decided to take action of their own, setting up 
        an information table in Smith Union and putting up signs highlighting 
        Iraqi human rights violations.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While I disagree with their position, I applaud these students for taking 
        the time to voice their opinions. Those who support the war should feel 
        the same way about the BCAWI. The anti-war coalition has done the student 
        body as a whole a great service by stimulating a great deal of debate 
        on campus.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Conservatives and liberals alike can rejoice in the fact that intelligent 
        political discussion has become more common than ever. Surely even those 
        opposed to the petition believe that campus life is more lively and interesting 
        when debate is occurring, even if they disapprove of the prevailing opinions. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        A campus where arguments are exchanged is infinitely more interesting 
        than a vapid one where everyone agrees. As author Joseph Jouberth eloquently 
        put it, &quot;It is better to debate a question without settling it than 
        to settle a question without debating it.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        After all, is not the goal of a liberal arts education to develop intelligent, 
        coherent arguments? This ability is the very heart of a liberal arts education. 
        Hopefully the anti-war movement has started Bowdoin down a long road of 
        discussion on a variety of issues. <br>
