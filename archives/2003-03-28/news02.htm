      <p align="left">First there was the petition condemning preemptive military 
        action, then a proposal for a referendum of student opinion about the 
        war, and then the passing of a resolution which, some argue, says essentially 
        nothing. For the Bowdoin Student Government, the past couple of weeks 
        have been focused on determining what Bowdoin's stance on war should be. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On campus, the issues have sparked heavy student debate, played out at 
        BSG meetings, letters to the Orient, and classroom discussions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At its March 4 meeting, the BSG addressed the issue which had begun the 
        week earlier. The Bowdoin Coalition Against War in Iraq brought a petition 
        signed by 924 Bowdoin students-a majority of the campus-opposing pre-emptive 
        action in Iraq, and asked that the BSG endorse the petition. Student Government 
        officers were wary to officially recognize it. Not only did they have 
        reservations about engaging in political affairs, but they also were concerned 
        about the actual content and wording of the proposal.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, at the March 4 meeting, BSG President Jason Hafler '04 said, 
        &quot;Student government feels that there is no problem with doing a referendum.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Molly Farneth '03 spoke in support of the government's recognition of 
        the petition, arguing, &quot;going to referendum undermines the process 
        we have labored under. We told people to remove names if they wanted to-far 
        more students added their name on. Referendum removes the voice of the 
        minority because it is a simple vote.&quot; Her comment was received with 
        loud applause. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Alex Nozik '03 agreed, saying that rejecting the petition was &quot;undermining 
        the Bowdoin Coalition's activism.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Adriana Schick '03 then presented the following resolution, which would 
        be an alternative to the petition and referendum: &quot;We, the Bowdoin 
        Student Government, are responsible for helping project the voice of the 
        majority of the student body here at Bowdoin College, in regards to affairs 
        that directly affect the Bowdoin student community at-large. We stand 
        resolved that the impending war in Iraq is an issue that proves to be 
        a pressing issue facing the country and the student community at the present 
        time&#133;.therefore we stand resolved that BSG has the ability and the 
        responsibility to consider and vote on whether to project the voice of 
        Bowdoin students on this issue of preemptive action in Iraq. BSG recognizes 
        and endorses the position of the majority on this issue, and the resolution 
        passes.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The president of the Bates College student government spoke at the meeting, 
        urging BSG to &quot;re-legitimize&quot; itself as a student government 
        by adopting the resolution, arguing that its passing would be &quot;a 
        huge compliment [to the authority of the BSG] as an entity, and as an 
        institution, on campus.&quot; The Bates College student government had 
        already publicly endorsed anti-military action sentiments as had Colby. 
        According to the Bates president, their student government indicates that 
        it has &quot;an obligation to make a stance.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        A vote deciding whether to have a referendum failed to pass by vote 10-9, 
        with three undecided. Alex Cornell '06 then proposed the resolution, and 
        it passed with 13 votes for, nine against, and three undecided. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sam Downing '05 said that the passing of the resolution is &quot;a brave 
        step forward for the Bowdoin Student Government&#133;we are a community 
        of informed citizens and critical thinkers who care deeply about our country&#133;war 
        affects us all very directly.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sarah Edgecomb '03, however, felt less enthusiastic about the student 
        government's recognizing national or world political affairs. Addressing 
        the assembly, she said, &quot;I don't think it is a good idea for the 
        student body of a college to act as a unit in embracing or rejecting controversial 
        policies,&quot; she said. &quot;It seems to me that doing so inhibits 
        our ability as students to fairly evaluate those policies, both inside 
        and outside of the classroom.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Eddie Briganti '05 is also opposed to BSG taking a political stand.&quot;There 
        are more effective avenues of getting your political views across. I think 
        it [the resolution issues] divided the campus unnecessarily.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Jason Hafler '04, BSG president, said that, while he did not necessarily 
        wish for the student government to form an opinion in support or against 
        the war, he felt it &quot;important to do something as a student government&#133;that's 
        why we had a meeting where we could debate this&#133;with the liberals, 
        the conservatives, expressing their views.&quot; Concerning the adoption 
        of the resolution, he also said, &quot;by our adopting the resolution&#133;we 
        expressed more of a willingness to involve ourselves in judging what the 
        student's opinion is on the issue than we should have.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Hafler said that he was approached by the Today Show on NBC, who asked 
        to know the sentiment of the Bowdoin College campus for a segment to be 
        shown on Friday, March 28. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ali George '03, speaking in support of student government's involvement 
        on the issue, said that while the student government shouldn't regularly 
        get itself involved in outside politics, &quot;this is an issue so compelling, 
        that it should command attention.&quot; She also said that &quot;there 
        are a lot of colleges-even Bates-who have a more active student body.&quot; 
        She continued to say that the BSG's main goal should continue to be &quot;improving 
        student life&#133;.we take on some pretty serious issues.&quot;</p>
