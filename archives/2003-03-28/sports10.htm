      <p align="left">Finishing a tremendous season with a final weekend of best 
        swims, the men's swim team placed eighth in the NESCAC championships. 
        Over the difficult three days of competition, the men kept their energy 
        high and hung tough in the face of illness and injury, while managing 
        some spectacular finishes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nicole Goyette '05 of the women's team said, &quot;The boys were absolutely 
        inspirational to watch. I can't really sum it up any better than to say 
        that they rocked!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Special congratulations go to Mike Long '04 and Roger Burleigh '06 for 
        making the National B qualifying times in the 50-yard freestyle and the 
        200-yard butterfly, respectively, with times of 21.26 and 1:54:57. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Long also earned a spot in the top 24 individual scorers in the meet, 
        with a total of 77 points for his team. In each individual race, he made 
        it into the finals, placing seventh in the 50-yard breaststroke, second 
        in the 50 free, and fourth in the 100-yard individual-medley.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As if that was not enough, he also made significant contributions to all 
        four 'A' relays. First-year sensation Burleigh scored points in all the 
        butterfly events, ending up in tenth for the 50, fourth in the 100,and 
        third in the 200. He also joined three relay teams and even swam through 
        an unfortunate collision with teammate Robie Anson '03. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Anson returned from his semester abroad to score in all three of his individual 
        events, like many of his other teammates. Showing off his versatility, 
        he came in the top 24 for the 50 fly, the 100 fly, and the 100-yard backstroke. 
        Fellow senior and co-captain Dave Harden snuck in twenty-third in the 
        500 free and had a personal best with his seventeenth place finish in 
        the 1000 free.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The swimming brothers, Carter Thomas '06 and Will Thomas '03, made enormous 
        contributions over the weekend with C. Thomas scoring eighteenth in the 
        50 free and fourteenth in the 100 fly. His elder brother and co-captain, 
        W. Thomas, was, as usual, an inspirational strength for the team, swimming 
        some difficult events to score needed points in races like the 200-yard 
        backstroke. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We had a great last weekend together,&quot; said W. Thomas. &quot;Everyone 
        put their heart out on the line, and we're all very happy with so many 
        personal best times and remarkable finishes.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Brian McGregor '05, the team's sole male diver, ended an impressive season 
        by leaping and twisting into fifth place on both the 1-meter and 3-meter 
        boards. Unfortunately, after losing all the other members of the men's 
        diving team throughout the season, he was unable to compete in the exhibitional 
        synchronized competition.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sophomores Ryan Boutin and Bill Alto both swam the limited number of entries, 
        making contributions on the relays and in individual events. Boutin raced 
        into the top 24 in the three backstroke events-50, 100, and 200-yard-while 
        Alto did the same in his two individual events-the 50-yard freestyle and 
        the 200-yard IM. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The first-year class again proved that Bowdoin has much to look forward 
        to in the next few years with sharks Ian Kyle, Jason Lewis, and Edgar 
        Pabon. As usual, Pabon raced some of the most difficult events back-to-back 
        over the three-day weekend, finishing twentieth in the 1000 free, twenty-second 
        in the 400 IM, and nineteenth in the mile. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lewis bravely joined him in the medley events, placing twenty-second in 
        the 200 and twentieth in the 400. Kyle also contributed by scoring eighteenth 
        in the 50-yard and 100-yard backstroke and twenty-fourth in the100 IM, 
        while showing off his freestyle on the relays. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the departure of valuable seniors, Bowdoin will stay strong.</p>
