      <p align="left">The Foodie does not claim to be a conossieur of Japanese 
        food. Nor is she particularly fond of it. However, when Foodie friends 
        are in the mood for a fresh, salty treat, the Foodie is happy to join 
        them. Such is the case every Wednesday for lunch, when the Foodie makes 
        her weekly soujourn to the Caf&eacute; for a sushi plate with her roommates. 
        However, unsure of her willingness to spend more than six dollars on this 
        so-so cuisine, the Foodie was reluctant to journey to Portland's pricier 
        Restaurant Sapporo. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sapporo's swanky d&eacute;cor, friendly service, and fine food convinced 
        her she had made the right choice. The Foodie recommends Sapporo for a 
        celebratory evening; although the majority of patrons donned jeans, the 
        Foodie did not feel out of place in her couture ball gown. She was particularly 
        pleased that her large party was given a comfortable nook at the back 
        of the restaurant in which to chortle and chuckle without disturbing other 
        patrons. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Small decorative touches differentiate Sapporo from a typical Japanese 
        restaurant. A fresh bird of paradise flower shyly bloomed from a corner 
        in their nook, while sushi arrived on textured glass plates. Blue and 
        green- hued ceramic plates framed non-sushi entrees. Much to her party's 
        glee, there was a fountain in the ladies' room!</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie was particularly endeared to Sapporo when the chef and owner 
        left his station to take a Polaroid of her party so it could remember 
        the restaurant always. This sometimes cynical Foodie for a flash feared 
        she would have to pay for the photo. However, she soon remembered that 
        she was not in her hometown of D.C. but in the state of Maine, where kindness 
        and generosity are as bounteous as cool breezes and swaying pines. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The food lived up to expectations. Miso soup warmed bellies and whetted 
        appetites for the delights to follow. The Foodie friend's fresh salmon 
        roll was delicate and neatly prepared, while other Friends savored their 
        beef-wrapped scallions, known as beef negima. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie and her friend particularly enjoyed their large helping of 
        the old raw fish phobic's standby, chicken teriyaki. The sauce was lightly 
        sweet; accompanying steamed vegetables were fresh and crunchy. One friend, 
        however, was dissatisfied with her very salty smoked salmon roll.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Foodie and her friends finished their feast with a round of fried 
        green tea ice cream- ice cream tempura. While this sweet selection was 
        favored by some, there were members of the party who found it strange. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The fluffy crust quickly became gummy and separate from the ice cream 
        it enveloped. It was not a light, flaky, delicate complement but an overpowering 
        lava that suffocated flavor. Yet the Foodie ate it all. She sometimes 
        finds that consuming comestibles with odd textures is strangely satisfying. 
        Perhaps the crust suffocated her brain just as it strangled the ice cream, 
        inducing her to eat it without judgement.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite this final dissatisfaction, the Foodie enjoyed her meal at Sapporo 
        and would return again. She might even try the sushi next time.<br>
