      <p align="left">Even though the Bowdoin Outing Club took a two-week break 
        from sending out official trips, Outing Club members were out in force, 
        all over the globe, adventuring on their own. Steve Popper, our very own 
        treasurer, traveled to the Gaspe Peninsula, where he back-country skied 
        on &quot;the most unbelievable snow ever.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Laurel Jones, '06, was out in Colorado during the massive snowstorm of 
        the second week of break. &quot;We got 96 inches of snow in less than 
        3 days!,&quot; she explains, &quot;it was AWESOME!!!! The most snow recorded 
        in one time in one place in the lower 48 states...ever! We were snowed 
        in. To get out we put our bags on the front loader of a tractor and walked 
        behind it... until it died. Then I trudged out in waist deep snow (it 
        was compacted) and hitched a ride to town to get some diesel for the tractor.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other members of the Outing Club headed south, way south, of the border 
        for a little sun and surf, as well as community service.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As part of the Costa Rica contingent, I can account for the absolute beauty 
        of the place. There was a large Bowdoin contingent in and around the country; 
        we calculated that at least 2 percent of the student body was enjoying 
        the Costa Rica sunshine for break. Mostly we spent our time on the beach, 
        surfing and swimming, although quite a few ventured to the rainforests 
        of Monteverde and the active volcano, Arenal. Monkeys and crocodiles were 
        also spotted, as well as a plethora of beautifully plumaged birds. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Another southern trip populated by members of the Outing Club was the 
        service trip to Peru. As Eliot Wright reports, &quot;in the end we had 
        painted the park benches, laid stone gravel in the walkways, transplanted 
        grass to the area, re-stained the altar and playground, constructed a 
        cement curb for the park, and planted many more trees! It was an amazing 
        amount of work achieved by such a small a dedicated group. But we certainly 
        could not have done it all without the help of the kids, the directors 
        of the park, and of course our bus driver Willy. You see, Willy is an 
        opera singing, racecar driving, cement mixing, wild guy that just attracts 
        kids like a magnet. Willy was one of the most incredible bus drivers I 
        have ever met.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        It sounds as if all there planning and fund-raising were well worth the 
        trip. Make sure to stop by the Outing Club next Monday night, March 31, 
        at 7:00 p.m., where you can see an amazing slide show of these and other 
        great trips from break. There will also be an ice cream social for the 
        whole Bowdoin community following the show. Also mark your calendars now 
        for April 28, when Backpacker Magazine will be coming to Bowdoin as a 
        part of the Get Out More! campaign. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Representatives from the magazine will be on hand to offer advice and 
        information about backpacking and general outdoor living. In the meantime, 
        stop by the Outdoor Leadership Center to pick-up a new spring schedule. 
        Trips include hiking, backpacking, white-water kayaking, rafting, canoeing, 
        and more!</p>
