        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: A friend of mine keeps cutting her arms. 
        She says she's not suicidal, but that she can't stop herself from doing 
        it. I'm getting pretty freaked out about it. What should I do? J.C.</p>
      <p>Dear J.C.: Your concern about your friend is well placed. She is clearly 
        struggling with some inner turmoil and needs help.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Cutting is one of the more common forms of intentional self-injury. It 
        is estimated that over one percent of the population are self-injurers, 
        primarily adolescents and young adults - predominantly young women. However, 
        the true prevalence of this behavior is likely higher. Many people who 
        injure themselves try to keep it secret, because they feel ashamed or 
        guilty about their behavior. They try to hide scars with clothing, and 
        if discovered, make up explanations for the injuries (&quot;cat scratches&quot; 
        are among the most common).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Self-injurers are not trying to kill themselves. They inflict harm on 
        themselves to bring relief from some kind of inner distress. Physical 
        pain is used as a way to try to escape emotional pain. Many self-injurers 
        report a great sense of calm and relief after hurting themselves. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Self-injurers tend to be perfectionists, unable to handle intense feelings, 
        unable to express their emotions verbally, and can at times feel overwhelmed 
        by dislike for themselves or their bodies. They may turn to self-injury 
        as a way to relieve intense anger, sadness or emotional pain, to express 
        their emotions and pain, to try to gain a sense of control of themselves 
        and their lives, or to punish themselves. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many authorities point out that self-injurers commonly struggle with low 
        self-esteem and feelings of invalidation. They may have been taught from 
        an early age that their thoughts and feelings about things were wrong, 
        or bad. They may have learned that certain feelings themselves were wrong 
        or bad, and not allowed. They may have been left feeling numb, unreal, 
        so dead inside, that seeing their own blood when they cut themselves is 
        their only way to feel real, to feel alive. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many self-injurers come from broken homes, from alcoholic homes, or from 
        families where parents were emotionally absent. One half to two-thirds 
        of self-injurers also struggle with disordered eating. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nearly 90 percent are survivors of sexual or physical abuse. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To return to your question, J.C.: your friend needs help for a number 
        of reasons. She must be struggling with her own very significant issues 
        and pain, and needs professional help and support. Suggest to her that 
        the two of you make an appointment at the Counseling Center, or talk to 
        someone at the Health Center or Res Life, if those seem less anxiety-provoking. 
        Tell her how concerned you are, how much you care about her pain, how 
        you want to help her get help.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although your friend's cutting does not represent a desire to take her 
        own life, it can nonetheless be very dangerous. A cut could go too deep, 
        or involve an unseen artery, tendon or nerve. An untended wound could 
        become infected. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are a large number of helpful websites to consult about self-injury. 
        Among them, S.A.F.E. Alternatives (&quot;Self-Abuse Finally Ends&quot;) 
        at www.selfinjury.com includes a good deal of information about various 
        aspects of self-injury, including treatment options and referrals, and 
        books, audio and video resources. Deb Martinson's &quot;Secret Shame (Self-Injury 
        Information and Support)&quot; website (www.palace.net/~llama/self-injury) 
        is equally comprehensive, but more personal. &quot;Mirror-mirror,&quot; 
        an eating disorders awareness website (www.mirror-mirror.org/selfinj.htm), 
        explores linkages between disordered eating, abuse and self-injury.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Acts of self-injury often bring out uncomfortable and negative feelings 
        in others, especially friends and care-givers. It is sometimes hard to 
        remember that the self-injurer is only trying to cope with her or his 
        own pain and inner turmoil, not to hurt or frustrate others. What the 
        self-injurer needs most from us all, is care and support and help finding 
        help.</p>

        Be well!</p>
