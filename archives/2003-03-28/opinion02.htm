        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In recent days there have been reports and statements made 
        by government officials hinting toward a return to the United Nations 
        once the war in Iraq is concluded with an American-led coalition victory. 
        Revisiting the United Nations to seek out a post-war resolution would 
        prove to be counterproductive. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The reasons for going to war were clear: to disarm a potentially hot and 
        hostile country, to relieve the Iraqi people from a brutal regime, to 
        take the next step in fighting terrorism, and finally to attempt to change 
        the political climate of the Middle East. There were countries, such as 
        Great Britain, Australia, Spain, Kuwait, and others that shared America's 
        view. France and Russia, most notably, did not. It was apparent that France 
        and Russia wanted no hand in effectively confronting Saddam Hussein; they 
        were willing, in traditional European fashion, to appease a vicious tyrant. 
        The United States and its allies are in the process of removing Saddam 
        Hussein from power and disarming Iraq. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Why should France and Russia have any influence in shaping a future government 
        that comes from a U.S.-led operation? Why should said nations have a part 
        in molding a society that they did not help liberate? Why shouldn't the 
        U.S. and Britain rebuild a country on their terms consistent with their 
        vision of a future Middle East? After all, The United States has a dramatically 
        different vision for the future than, let's say, Russia. Russia has been 
        financially backing the Iranian nuclear reactor development program, essentially 
        providing one of the biggest supporters, both ideologically and financially, 
        of international and regional terrorism with the ability to create nuclear 
        weapons. By giving Iran a means of acquiring a nuclear arsenal, Russia 
        has made a non-verbal statement: we will support any state's ambitions 
        for a price. With such an approach to the dangers in the Middle East, 
        why should Russia have a role in formulating a government in the region? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        French President Jacques Chirac has already stated that he would oppose 
        any rebuilding of Iraq with the U.S. playing a dominant role, which sets 
        up a fierce diplomatic war. The damage of such a political battle, which 
        will not end in the United States' favor, could be irreversible. The United 
        States has a chance now to prove that it is capable of building a free 
        nation in a more hostile climate than Japan or post-war Europe. This precious 
        opportunity to reshape the political landscape of the Middle East should 
        not be hijacked by the French and their sympathizers. A country that has 
        stopped at nothing to undermine America's legitimacy should not compromise 
        U.S. interests and goals. Is that the kind of partner the U.S. needs at 
        such a critical juncture? The certain deadlock that will result if the 
        Iraqi question returns for a second round would draw time and focus away 
        from the objective, to build a new, peaceful, democratic Iraq. Iraq has 
        the wealth and the U.S. and its allies have the resources to build a new 
        Iraq successfully, it does not need the United Nations' support. The U.S. 
        and its coalition should focus its energy and resources on rebuilding 
        Iraq properly, not on fighting a political war with the French and the 
        Russians in the United Nations.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Those opposed to the war in Iraq continuously spoke of how America will 
        face devastating consequences. I say, let those that chose to oppose the 
        war effort also suffer the consequences of their decision. They should 
        not have an economic gain from the rebuilding process nor should they 
        be allowed to influence the political sphere. The United Nations should 
        help on the humanitarian front, not the political. The United Nations 
        was seen as the impotent, partial organization that it is; returning to 
        it would only restore legitimacy to an organization that has not proven 
        to be credible.<br>
