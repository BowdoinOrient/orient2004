      <p align="left">Despite high hopes and great expectations, the men's ice 
        hockey team was eliminated from the postseason in the first round of playoffs 
        on March 1. Dayton Arena was filled to capacity with screaming Polar Bear 
        fans, but the strong crowd support was not enough to counter a potent 
        Hamilton College squad, as the Polar Bears fell to the visiting Continentals 
        6-3.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin's lackluster performance came as no surprise to men's ice hockey 
        fans, as the Polar Bears had won only two of the final ten games of the 
        regular season. Despite out-shooting Hamilton 38 to 27, Bowdoin's offense 
        was no match for Hamilton goaltender Gabe Tash. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meanwhile, Bowdoin's normally solid defensive unit crumbled in the second 
        period, allowing three unanswered Hamilton goals within ten minutes of 
        play. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Talented junior goaltender Mike Healey struggled, making only five saves, 
        and was pulled from the game in the second period. After a solid victory 
        against Bowdoin, Hamilton went on to lose 5-3 to Middlebury College in 
        the second round of NESCAC playoffs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although Bowdoin's season ended on a disappointing note, head coach Terry 
        Meagher was more than pleased with the season's results. &quot;You can 
        always improve,&quot; he said, &quot;but I am a big believer in taking 
        a look at what you did over the long haul. I think we had a very successful 
        season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Indeed, Bowdoin's final record of 13-6-5 was good enough for a fourth 
        place finish in the highly competitive NESCAC. Bowdoin was also ranked 
        among the top ten Division III teams in the country for most of the season, 
        and won in a blowout game against the eventual NESCAC champions, Trinity 
        College.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Meagher was also glowing with praise for his three senior captains Jared 
        Porter, Ryan Seymour, and Sean Starke. &quot;Our senior leadership was 
        excellent this year,&quot; said Meagher. &quot;I never had any question 
        about their quality on and off the ice. They are three very special people.&quot; 
        Starke led by example more than anyone, as he led the team this year in 
        both goals and assists, registering 15 in both categories.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite his struggles in the final stretch of the season, goaltender Mike 
        Healey was also instrumental in Bowdoin's successes, as he made 508 saves 
        this season, allowing only one shot in ten past his glove. &quot;I can't 
        wait to have him back next year,&quot; said Meagher.</p>
      <p align="left">
        When asked about next season, coach Meagher was honest about Bowdoin's 
        prospects. &quot;We will have a very young team next year,&quot; said 
        Meagher. &quot;Youth brings a lot of excitement and enthusiasm to the 
        game, but it also brings inexperience. The learning curve in this league 
        is very steep, and while we have the talent to succeed, next year's squad 
        will be greener than grass.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        For now, Meagher must focus on recruiting. Every graduating senior class 
        needs an incoming freshman class to fill the roster sheets, and for now 
        Meagher has his hands full, making sure the best and brightest hockey 
        players out there choose to spend four years playing under Dayton's hallowed 
        rafters. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the spring still leaves room for reflection and a little relaxation. 
        &quot;We played entertaining hockey this season, and you can tell how 
        much the fans enjoy it. Winning is important, but bringing something positive 
        to the college hold equal weight with me.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Congratulations to the men's ice hockey team for a successful season. 
        GO U BEARS!</p>
