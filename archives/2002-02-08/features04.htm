        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: I've heard that there may be meningitis 
        on campus. Is that true? And does that mean we should all get vaccinated 
        or take antibiotics? B.G.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear B.G.: First and foremost, there have been NO cases 
        of meningitis on campus. No known cases of viral meningitis, and no known 
        cases of bacterial-meningococcal-meningitis (by far, the more serious 
        of the two).<br>
        Meningococcal meningitis is an infection of the central nervous system 
        (brain + spinal cord) caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitides. 
        It often begins as a vague, flu-like illness, but can progress extremely 
        rapidly, with the development of headache, fever, stiff neck, and vomiting. 
        A characteristic rash appears late, usually just prior to collapse and 
        coma. If treated promptly, meningococcal meningitis is highly curable. 
        Untreated, it is likely fatal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fortunately, meningococcal meningitis is quite rare. There 
        are about 3,000 sporadic cases per year in this country. Between 100 and 
        125 of them occur on college campuses. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The natural reservoir of meningococcus is the back of our 
        throats. In fact, Neisseriae can be cultured from up to 15 percent of 
        randomly selected healthy individuals. These &quot;asymptomatic carriers&quot; 
        do not themselves develop meningitis. They may spread the bacteria by 
        sneezing or coughing, however, and others may be more susceptible. Carriage 
        rates rise to 40 percent, among close contacts of people with active meningitis. 
        During a meningitis outbreak, the carriage rate in &quot;closed populations&quot; 
        like college dormitories or military barracks will likely be higher still 
        -- up to 75 percent. <br>
        Carriers can be treated with antibiotics, and cleared of Neisseria, for 
        at least some period of time. That's the reason for treating all close 
        contacts of people with active meningitis. The same rationale underlies 
        treating all residents of dormitories and barracks, during a meningitis 
        outbreak.So: why not test everyone - and treat all carriers - before there's 
        an outbreak? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meningococcal meningitis is rare. The risk of disease among 
        college freshmen in residence is about 1 in 300,000. For purposes of comparison, 
        that's about three times as likely as their lifetime risk of being struck 
        by lightning. From a public health point of view, it makes little sense 
        to test 100 percent of a population, then treat up to 15 percent, in order 
        to prevent an illness that will affect only 0.00033 percent. Plus, you 
        never know when you might become a carrier, or for how long.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of course, there IS a meningococcal vaccine. It's about 
        90 percent protective against four of the five serotypes of Neisseria 
        that cause meningitis. These four serotypes are responsible for about 
        70 percent of meningitis cases. If everyone were vaccinated, then almost 
        2 out of every 3 meningococcal meningitis cases could be prevented.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The vaccine has no significant side effects or risks. Its 
        protective effects last 3-4 years. It is currently manufactured under 
        patent by one company. The vaccine is quite expensive, and is being aggressively 
        marketed to college health centers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Centers for Disease Control have made the following 
        calculation. Vaccination of all first-year college students would likely 
        prevent 37-69 cases of disease, and 2-4 deaths, each year. The cost per 
        case prevented would be about $3 million, and the cost per death prevented, 
        about $48 million. That's many, many orders of magnitude more expensive 
        than any other public health intervention.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Health Center's cost for the vaccine, on the other hand, 
        is $59, and that's what you would pay if you chose to be vaccinated here. 
        <br>
        To return to your original question: should you get vaccinated against 
        meningococcal meningitis or take antibiotics preventively? The only &quot;down 
        sides&quot; to the vaccine are the cost and a mildly sore arm. On the 
        &quot;upside,&quot; you'll be protected against four of the five serotypes 
        of Neisseria for a few years, and so reduce your risk of infection by 
        almost two thirds. That is a significant reduction. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">You should take antibiotics preventively only if you've 
        been exposed to someone with active meningitis. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is one final wrinkle to consider. In the event of 
        an actual case of meningococcal meningitis on campus, all close contacts 
        would need to take antibiotics whether or not they had been vaccinated. 
        The serotype of the infecting Neisseria would take days to determine. 
        Antibiotics are immediately effective against all five strains of meningocococcus. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of us at the Health Center would be happy to discuss 
        any questions or concerns you may have. The final decisions, of course, 
        are yours. <br>
