        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Ranked 13-2-0, the Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey team continues 
        to cruise through its competition. Wednesday night they defeated the 13-5-4 
        University of Southern Maine Huskies by a score of 2-0. Emily McKissock 
        '03 made 22 saves in the match-up to preserve her sixth shutout of the 
        season, setting a new school record for single-season shutouts by a goaltender. 
        Shelley Chessie scored both goals in the game and currently leads the 
        team in scoring.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Assistant Coach James Plumer notes that &quot;Chessie, Ba 
        Lanoue, and Jen Pelkey have all been playing very well offensively, while 
        Kirsti Anderson and Kirsten Larsen are anchoring an offensive-minded defense 
        corps.&quot; He also points out that &quot;McKissock is playing well right 
        now also, with 5 shut-outs in her last 8 Division III games.&quot; However, 
        Plumer is pleased to share, &quot;We are blessed in that we are very deep 
        and our scoring is balanced. We have 10 players who are in double-digits 
        in scoring, by far the most in <br>
        NESCAC.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This season has been full of triumphs for the Polar Bears, 
        perhaps the only true disappointment coming with the homeloss to Middlebury. 
        However, Middlebury's incredible unbeaten streak ended a few weeks ago, 
        and while some Bears are dismayed that the Panthers' dynasty failed to 
        fall at the feet of Bowdoin, they are eager to face the now vulnerable 
        team. &quot;I don't think their (Middlebury's) loss makes it any easier 
        as they are still a strong team and seem to have rebounded nicely, but 
        it sure does make them seem more human. Our coaching staff and players 
        believe that we can beat them if we play well even on their home ice,&quot; 
        states Plumer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The season is beginning to wind down in terms of the number 
        of games remaining, but the emotional and physical limits of the Polar 
        Bears are just beginning to be stretched. The last four games of the season 
        include two versus in-state rival Colby, and also showdowns with NESCAC 
        rivals Williams and the aforementioned Middlebury. Jess Burke '04 observes 
        &quot;We are at a very crucial stage in our season and it is critical 
        for us to stay focused and healthy.&quot; Sadie Wieschhoff '04 also notes 
        the last part of the season will be &quot;...a true test of the team with 
        many hard teams in a short span.&quot; But she also condfidently added, 
        &quot;We are up to the challenge.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is apparent to the team of Polar Bears what it will take 
        to push their opponents into oblivion. They know they have a rough road 
        ahead, but they also know there are certain intangibles they can count 
        on that allows them to outshine any rival. As far as team unity is concerned, 
        nearly all the Bears have their belly-buttons pierced;and as far as fan 
        support, well let's just say Superfan Alex Harris did not just get hers 
        pierced this week by coming up with the idea alone, she was inspired. 
        I think it is apparent what this team is willing to do for you - it includes 
        filling your school with spirit, achieving new heights in Women's Ice 
        Hockey, and providing hours of entertainment. </p>
      <p align="left">The question now is, when this team, who has given you so 
        much needs you the most, what are you willing to do? Will you suffer physical 
        pain to show your allegience as self-proclaimed &quot;Superfan&quot; Alex 
        Harris has done? Will you buy pawprint tattoes from the Softball team 
        and place them all over your body? Will you cheer as if your life depended 
        on it this Friday night at 7 when your beloved Bears play Concordia? These 
        questions need answers, and these Bears need you. </p>
