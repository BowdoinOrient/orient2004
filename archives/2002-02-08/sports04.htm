      <p>&quot;We found a way to win,&quot; head coach Terry Meagher said. &quot;Every 
        game this time of year is big-they all represent points-and we're trying 
        to hold our position.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Their position is a strong one at present. The Bears, who are #3 in national 
        Division III rankings, are still the only team in college hockey with 
        an undefeated record. As the men attempt to keep a hold of that record, 
        some big games lurk on the horizon, including every Bowdoin fan's favorite 
        the Colby home game. As usual, however, they're taking it one game at 
        a time, never looking too far ahead. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In accordance with that philosophy, they dealt losses to Norwich and 
        St. Michael's last weekend, one by one.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Norwich game, which ended in a 3-1 Bear victory, didn't come easily. 
        &quot;We struggled a bit in the first period,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We 
        weren't as secure in our zone play, but we worked our way through it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bill Busch '02 found open net in the first period after Adam Mantin '03 
        fed the puck forward, putting the Bears up 1-0. Sophomore Chris Pelletier 
        beat the Norwich goaltender in the first minute of the second period for 
        another, and Dave Rush '02 finished the scoring with a man-up goal at 
        17:32.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Meagher said, despite the 3-0 lead, it wasn't smooth sailing. &quot;We 
        had to kill some penalties in the second, and it was hard to get a flow 
        going,&quot; he said. &quot;But I thought our rhythm came back and we 
        played the third as the type of period we should have.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Norwich's Phil Aucoin managed a goal at 8:29 in the third, but the Bears 
        were able to hang on to the win with the play of sophomore netminder Mike 
        Healey. He stopped 28 Norwich shots in the game.According to Meagher, 
        he did an excellent job of mitigating the Norwich offense. &quot;He was 
        outstanding,&quot; Meagher said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After Friday's success, it was on to St. Michael's (8-10-1)-an 8-1 game 
        in which six different Polar Bears scored. &quot;Aesthetically, I thought 
        we played a very nice hockey game,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;I was very 
        pleased with Saturday's play from a technical point of view.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mike Carosi '02, Sean Starke '03, Ryan Seymour '03, Shannon McNevan '05, 
        Pelletier, Rush, and Busch all found the net at least once, tallying an 
        insurmountable eight goals against St. Michael's one. Healey made 13 saves 
        in the win.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Meagher said, while he was pleased with last weekend's wins, he was very 
        proud of Bowdoin athletics as a whole. &quot;It was a wonderful weekend 
        for our team,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;But to see the success of all 
        our teams, how the athletes are interacting, the students are supporting 
        them-it's a very healthy environment at Bowdoin right now. That got me 
        really excited.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to several players, looking back over the course of the season 
        reveals some measurable improvements. &quot;I think the biggest difference 
        between the beginning of the season and now is in the forwards,&quot; 
        Healey said. &quot;They are really engaging in the play and finding the 
        seams.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The defensemen have consistently been able to find the soft areas 
        of the ice and aren't making flat passes under duress,&quot; he added.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Carosi agreed. &quot;The team has made the most progress on the defensive 
        end,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears hit the road again this weekend for their last two away games 
        of the regular season. &quot;We're looking to continue our team's solid 
        play this weekend,&quot; Carosi said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Tonight's matchup with the University of Southern Maine is set to begin 
        at 7:00 p.m. &quot;We're looking forward to playing a tough defense against 
        both opponents and we expect to have all four lines producing offensively,&quot; 
        Pelletier said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Meagher said it should be a good weekend for points competition. &quot;[USM 
        is] playing very well right now,&quot; he said. &quot;They're moving up 
        the ladder on their side.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The men face Salem State for the second time this season on Saturday 
        at 3:00 p.m.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Again, it's about points,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We'll make 
        some adjustments; we've got some bumps and bruises that will change the 
        matchups from last time.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Only three regular-season games will remain after Saturday, all of which 
        are home matchups. &quot;It will be nice to put away the suitcases for 
        a while,&quot; Meagher joked.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears look to finish off the White Mules from Colby next Tuesday 
        at 7:00 p.m. If it's anything like December 8's barnburner-which ended 
        in a 6-6 split-it will be one to watch.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;That was a classic,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;Traditionally, we've 
        had close games, but that was like six games in one.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Coming off the way our students were this weekend, we're expecting 
        a fun evening,&quot; he added.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Pelletier agreed. &quot;The Bowdoin-Colby game is one of a kind,&quot; 
        Pelletier said. &quot;The rivalry runs deep and we always get great fan 
        support. The students have a lot of pride in our hockey team, and the 
        game seems to bring out everyone's spirit.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He went on to say that support from Bowdoin fans makes a big difference 
        in the game's intensity. &quot;We play them tough physically and we thrive 
        on the excitement the crowd creates,&quot; he said. &quot;We love to play 
        in front of a big crowd, they make it very easy for us to play the best 
        we possibly can.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>If an age-old rivalry isn't enough to motivate you to get over to Dayton 
        next Tuesday, Carosi said that watching &quot;...arguably the nation's 
        best goaltender, Mike Healey&quot; is reason enough.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Tuesday, 7:00 p.m. Cheer on the Bears as they send those damn Mules back 
        to Waterville!</p>
