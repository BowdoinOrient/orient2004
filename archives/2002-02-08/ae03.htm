        <font size="2">MONICA GUZMAN<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></p>
      <p> Sometimes the most enjoyable movie experiences come when you don't know 
        what you're getting into, when you let the movie and only the movie take 
        you in. What's stopping us from seeing every new movie like this, you 
        ask? Why, the trailers, of course. Those quick commercial thrill rides 
        that often have the annoying effect of spoiling the intrigue of the movie 
        they're trying to sell. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Every now and then, though, a film is released with few if any loud overtures. 
        These films are not nationally advertised; they remain mysterious until 
        you take the initiative and willingly put yourself in their grip. <i>In 
        the Bedroom</i> is one of those movies.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, it's playing at the Eveningstar Cinema-close enough even for 
        car-less first years. The student discount tickets, whose existence some 
        other theaters are completely ignorant of, made my good movie-going experience 
        even better, not to mention the fact that I got to sit in an armchair 
        almost as comfy as the sofa in front of the Language Media Center. Almost.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The film follows the life of a couple in Camden, Maine (Tom Wilkinson 
        and Sissy Spacek) and the romance of their college-age son (Nick Stahl) 
        to a much older woman (Marisa Tomei). About 40 minutes into the film, 
        a shocking event involving the woman's ex-husband catalyzes a change in 
        the characters that leads them to do things they never thought themselves 
        capable of. I can't tell you what the event is. You have to experience 
        it for yourself (genius points if you caught the Matrix reference).<br>
      </p>
      <p>This &quot;dark drama,&quot; as I've often heard it called, is also a 
        chilling character study that shows us the darker side of ourselves. It 
        is especially fitting for us temporary Mainers because these people are 
        homely, hardworking, and superbly Maine-a mirror of our own community. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The film is director Todd Field's first feature (OMG!), which, as far 
        as debuts usually go, is impressive. The strictly observational cinematography 
        suggests a more mature filmmaker who's already played with the rules and 
        is secure with his own style. This guy's going places I can't wait to 
        follow him to.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The performances of both Wilkinson and Spacek were candid and inspired 
        (Spacek got the Golden Globe), and they even perfected the ever-ambiguous 
        Maine accent, a challenge in itself. Nothing their characters do is unbelievable 
        due to the honesty with which they are portrayed. We follow them along 
        without ever stopping to ask why-without ever doubting their fated path. 
        What they end up doing doesn't seem so wrong to us; we know as viewers 
        that it was inevitable. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I walked out of the Eveningstar somewhat changed by the film's sincere 
        presentation of the sinister side of human nature. It's through these 
        films that we're made aware of how fragile our own morality can be-how 
        easily we compromise. Take the risk: plunge into the dark depths of this 
        skillfully twisted small-town drama. It's unspoiled, unashamed, and waiting 
        down the street to enlighten you.</p>
