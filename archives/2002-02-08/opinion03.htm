        <font size="2">HUGH HILL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Enron. The first serious scandal of the Bush Jr. administration (other 
        than the fact that his opponent actually won the election). I'll remember 
        this one with relish.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Democrats are kicking their heels back, waiting for the axe to fall on 
        the oh-so-deserving necks of the Bush administration. Many who remember 
        their eight years of frothy-mouthed persecution by the half-witted religious 
        demagogues of the &quot;New Right&quot; figure that it's payback time. 
        At least this is more clear-cut than Vince Foster or Whitewater.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I was going to restrain myself from this one, as scandal mongering is 
        scurrilous at best, but Mr. Buell's editorial in last week's Orient (&quot;Reason, 
        Politics, and Enron,&quot; 1 February 2002) has prompted me to engage 
        in the mud wars. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sandwiched between a Classical appeal for Platonic reason over passion 
        in politics, Mr. Buell tries to both defend George Jr. and his puppet-master 
        Cheney's conduct in the Enron case and to take the traditional conservative 
        swipe at campaign finance reform. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While I applaud anyone who wishes to bring classical virtue into the 
        political debate, may I remind Mr. Buell that most of our electorate today 
        would be categorized by Plato as &quot;bronze&quot; (i.e. ruled by their 
        passions and not their intellect)? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, I want to compliment Mr. Buell's choice of subject matter. 
        As disparate as they may seem, Enron and campaign finance reform are actually 
        closely linked, though Mr. Buell fails to make that needed connection.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So who's going to do it? Oh, I'll take a stab. Let's try looking for 
        the truth, without the hype, in honor of our Classical forbearers. Let 
        us establish the facts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Enron, a large energy conglomerate, went bankrupt. Its executives hid 
        its financial problems from both the world and their employees. Then, 
        the executives sold off their stock under the pretense that everything 
        was fine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>They encouraged employees to buy Enron stock, and even forbid them from 
        selling their holdings. When news of the company's financial disasters 
        emerged, the executives had cashed out, leaving the employees with worthless 
        retirement funds. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Republicans and Democrats both agree that some of these executives deserve 
        a trip to the Federal White Collar Minimum Security Penitentiary and Country 
        Club. But wait-there's more! <br>
      </p>
      <p>Enron was the most politically connected company in Washington. It made 
        billions off energy market deregulation in the U.S., and showed its appreciation 
        by donating millions of dollars to both political parties in Washington 
        via unregulated &quot;soft money&quot; contributions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Both parties received their largesse, but the biggest beneficiary of 
        all was George Bush's buying of the 2000 Presidential race. This is where 
        we tie back into campaign finance reform. How did most of it get there? 
        Unregulated soft money transfers. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Shays-Meehan, a bill that effectively bans such transfers, is up in the 
        House now. Republicans are in a tizzy, knowing that without being able 
        to raise large sums from corporations and the rich, they will never be 
        able to buy the TV time to dupe poorer people into shooting themselves 
        in the foot and voting Republican.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Buell, knowing what doom the end of soft money might mean for Republicans, 
        tries to dissuade liberals by saying that &quot;good&quot; organizations 
        like labor unions and the environmental lobby will have some of their 
        political power neutered. This is sad, but what these groups donate in 
        soft money is a drop in the bucket compared to what corporations and the 
        rich give.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Most Republicans admit the increased influence granted to the rich and 
        powerful from soft money. Mr. Buell references a wonderful quote from 
        George Will that effectually says that the rich should have more influence 
        because they are most affected by government.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Good for George, at least he puts passion aside and acknowledges the 
        anti-democratic, plutocratic nature of the Republican Party. I hope this 
        pulls at every single one of your democratic impulses and makes you want 
        to puke your guts out, because it's the most elitist, anti-American crap 
        I've heard in a while. Let's all pray that Shays-Maheen passes the House 
        and ends the unfair influence soft money buys.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Back to Enron. Soft money donations allowed the company to create an 
        environment in which it could use shady accounting practices.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To the Bush administration's credit, when Lay and his Enron buddies came 
        begging for a bailout last fall, it refused. There is some hope for President 
        Cheney and his little sidekick Boy George (always getting into trouble 
        he is!).<br>
      </p>
      <p>What should we take away from Enron? Money is too powerful in politics. 
        It allowed a lot of innocent folks to really get hurt. Soft money has 
        to go, so there won't be any more Enrons.</p>
