      <p>Popular rumors at Bowdoin include:</p>
      <p>1) Ivies Weekend is so named because Bowdoin is celebrating our refusal 
        to join the Ivy League<br>
        2) Britney Spears is coming to Bowdoin<br>
        3) There are still underground frats<br>
        4) First-semester grades of freshman year don't count<br>
        5) 60% of Bowdoin students marry Bowdoin students</p>
      <p>While the first four rumors are clearly unfounded fabrications and are 
        often cleared up early in a Bowdoin student's career, the last one is 
        sort of tip-toed around-everyone has heard it, but it's hard to prove 
        or disprove. <br>
        I could probably sit in the Alumni Office and review the Bulletins to 
        calculate the actual figure and report back to the Orient with an authoritative 
        figure, ending the dispute once and for all, but let's be honest, I just 
        don't care enough. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, I don't think the actual figure is as important as the impact 
        of the mere idea on Bowdoin students. In the back of our minds, we all 
        remember hearing it at one time or another, and to some extent it affects 
        us in our interactions. So this week I want to look at the implications 
        of THE MARRIAGE MYTH OF BOWDOIN.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The number of people who believe that when in choosing a college, one 
        may also be choosing where he or she will find a husband or wife is surprising. 
        Lee once told me that his parents met in college and he thought this was 
        the best way to go about becoming betrothed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This is a very scary thought for some people, myself included. It implies 
        that you may marry the lacrosse player who kicked you while he was doing 
        a keg stand last weekend or that cute host of a WBOR show who sits in 
        the back of your Greek class. That's a pretty intimidating thought!<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I don't want to worry about finding a husband at Bowdoin!&quot; 
        exclaims Carrie. &quot;I just want to have a good time!&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some students do take this seriously, though. These are the people who 
        come to school and immediately attach themselves. They generally disapprove 
        of random hookups in favor of searching for a life partner. Once they 
        find this special someone (or someones-these are the breed known as 'serial 
        monogamists'), they rearrange their schedules, spend all of their time 
        both at school and over vacations with this person, and basically try 
        (within the parameters of Res Life) to move in with them. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Edie and Rob are such a couple. Their friends realized it was getting 
        serious when Rob stopped caring about getting fined by his teammates and 
        sat with Edie anyway at dinner and Edie no longer joined her friends for 
        weekly Sunday brunches at Big Top. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Then Rob bought her a toothbrush to keep in his bathroom. Then they split 
        Spring Break to be with his family for one week and with hers for the 
        other (now they alternate all holidays with their families). They don't 
        even go out with their friends anymore, preferring to just stay in together 
        and watch cheesy romantic comedies. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Edie and Rob, at the ripe young age of college students, have essentially 
        gotten married. Not that it is particularly uncommon for young adults 
        to get married, but one has to wonder if they will ever know what it is 
        like to live without each other (not to mention have sex with anyone else 
        ever again.) They are on the track to become that legendary 60 percent.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the other end of the spectrum is Colette. Colette is always hooking 
        up with one guy or another. These aren't random hookups as much as they 
        are a series of anti-relationships. Many people call her different things, 
        but I would like to call her scared. It seems to me that she has chosen 
        not to go the route of Edie and Rob but rather to desperately avoid any 
        possibility of the marriage myth and make sure she is never attached to 
        anyone.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If Edie, Rob, and Colette are all happy, I have no right to judge their 
        choices. I only wish to point out that I believe they all are, whether 
        consciously or not, influenced by the myth that Bowdoin relationships 
        end in marriage. Clearly Edie and Rob are comfortable with this idea and 
        perhaps were seeking it, where Colette fears entering one of these pseudo-marriages 
        because it may lead to an actual wedding. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This is not to say that Bowdoin is alone in this dichotomous social scene. 
        Most of the other NESCAC schools boast the same statistics. But is it 
        really fair to put that sort of pressure on young men and women? Shouldn't 
        we focus on getting to know ourselves and who we are in and out of relationships 
        before we head off into the real world with our liberal arts educations? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>I don't want this week's column to be a condemnation of either of these 
        options, because I am sure there are some who would choose relationships 
        without the influence of the marriage myth. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, the myth does affect many others. To these students 
        I would like to make clear that college is about learning about yourself 
        and becoming a whole person on your own, not actively seeking or avoiding 
        someone else to define who you are. A happy medium does exist; it is possible 
        to be involved with someone beyond hooking up and yet not looking for 
        a ring. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So if you want to be in a relationship, do. And if you don't, don't. 
        Please don't let some statistic that the admissions office threw your 
        way influence your decisions. </p>
