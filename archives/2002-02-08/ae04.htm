        <font size="2">KERRY ELSON<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin students, faculty, and friends attended a veritable 
        s&eacute;ance last Saturday night while attending the staged reading of 
        <i>To Be Young, Gifted and Black</i>. Eight students slowly emerged from 
        the dusky wings of Wish Theater to resurrect playwright Lorraine Hansberry, 
        the first black woman to have a play produced on Broadway and the creator 
        of the play <i>A Raisin in the Sun</i>. As though participating in a monster 
        game of Ouija, audience members hushed and let Hansberry's spirit pass. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Consisting of excerpts from Hansberry's diary entries, letters 
        and plays, the show chronicled the playwright's life from her school days 
        to the successes and failures of her work to her involvement in politics. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The play engaged both real and fictional characters, and 
        it presented events in and out of sequence. This collage of voices and 
        eras had the potential to be confusing, but the elimination of blocking 
        and costume changes made the production more streamlined. The &quot;staged 
        reading&quot; format allowed the audience to focus solely on the words 
        of the playwright. Robinson says, &quot;I really feel like [Hansberry] 
        is in the room with us when we're [reading the script].&quot; Hansberry's 
        ghost is benevolent: no glass vases were smashed and no theater seats 
        were mysteriously jostled during the performance.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Robinson first saw a production of <i>Black</i> at Emerson 
        College, where he used to teach. He was attracted to the show because 
        it had a multi-racial cast and made references to plays and music from 
        different cultures. The show was especially fitting for a liberal arts 
        college, such as Bowdoin, he feels, because it dealt with issues of college 
        life and reached across boundaries. &quot;One thing I loved about the 
        show,&quot; Robinson says, &quot; is that...you have a black woman playing 
        Lorraine Hansberry and then in the next scene it's a white woman playing 
        Lorraine Hansberry. I just loved the idea that her voice moves around 
        through different people.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When he first arrived to teach at Bowdoin, Robinson found 
        it difficult to assemble the multi-racial cast the play required. During 
        the fall 2001 auditions, however, Robinson saw a number of talented actors 
        who could fulfill the casting requirements. &quot;I added [the show] to 
        the season after the auditions,&quot; Robinson says, &quot;because I said 
        'Oh, we've got some good people, we can do this thing.'&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Robinson hopes that the presence of Black's multi-racial 
        cast will encourage students of all nationalities to participate in Bowdoin 
        theater. Corona Benson, a member of the cast, also considers the reading 
        to be a positive step in making Bowdoin theater more inclusive. She says, 
        &quot;It was a tremendously diverse cast. You just don't see that very 
        often across the board at Bowdoin, but especially...in terms of the theater. 
        The show as a whole had a very different flavor than a lot of what Bowdoin 
        has seen.&quot; </p>
