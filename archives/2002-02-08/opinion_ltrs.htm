      <p align="left"><font size="4">Comments on grade inflation</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Grade inflation is no different from monetary inflation; if pressures 
        to increase the average grade for a given performance are not balanced 
        by equal pressures to lower it, the grade will go up. Therefore, in order 
        to understand the process, we have to look at both sides of the ledger.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What pressures are there to increase the grade for a given performance? 
        Students like to receive higher grades, because they feel better about 
        themselves and have improved chances for employment or graduate/professional 
        school acceptance. Faculty members also like to give higher grades; they 
        like to help their students, minimize student complaints, and maximize 
        positive student evaluations. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Departments, in their competition for students, don't want to be perceived 
        as too hard. Given a choice between lowering their course requirements 
        and inflating their grades, the choice is easy-grade inflation carries 
        no penalties. And administrators like to believe that they administer 
        a good institution and have recruited exceptionally strong students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In short, all the incentives favor grade inflation. Call it the Lake 
        Wobegon effect, 'where all the children are above average.'<br>
      </p>
      <p>The balancing pressures must therefore come from the world outside the 
        institution: prospective employers and graduate or professional school 
        admission committees in particular, and society in general. Prospective 
        employers and admission committees' relative comparisons at a given time, 
        not between present and past applicants, are therefore no match for the 
        internal inflationary pressures. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Public opinion frowns on a lowering of standards, and such practices 
        tarnish the reputation of an institution that visibly does so. But that 
        does not prevent a slow, general slide of the standards that is only statistically 
        discernible. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So what happens? As grades slowly inflate and become less useful in identifying 
        top applicants, prospective employers and admission committees start to 
        discount them, and look for other, supposedly more reliable criteria, 
        such as relative class rank and GRE scores. Inflation is incorporated 
        in the judgment; where a straight B record used to be fine, it is now 
        frowned upon.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I have served on chemistry graduate admission committees, where one can 
        clearly see the traditions at different types of institutions. It was 
        obvious that grades from liberal arts colleges were roughly comparable 
        to grades from engineering colleges that were one full letter grade lower: 
        a C from an engineering school was an OK grade, comparable to a B from 
        a liberal arts college. Why? Because the engineering schools as a group 
        apparently have done a better job keeping grade inflation at bay. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is not clear why, in liberal arts colleges, grade inflation has been 
        so much stronger in the humanities than in the physical sciences, but 
        that appears to be a rather general phenomenon. And part of the explanation 
        why grade inflation for, say, chemistry, has been higher in liberal arts 
        colleges than in engineering schools, may well lie in the absence of competition 
        from the humanities in engineering schools. Or, perhaps, deans of engineering 
        are more alert to statistical trends than their liberal arts colleagues. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Now the real question: does it matter? Most likely not, because as grades 
        become less meaningful, society will start using other measures to satisfy 
        its need to differentiate.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That need will remain; the tools to satisfy it can and do change. If 
        everyone earns an A, it will mean that the candidate attended the course- 
        no more, no less-and will be interpreted accordingly.</p>

      <p><font size="4"><a name="2"></a>Academics: our first priority</font></p>
      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I should like to respond to the editorial you published in last week's 
        Orient, entitled &quot;Grades Do Not Indicate Ability.&quot; While I agree 
        with your assertion that good grades do not necessarily equal high ability, 
        there was one sentence you used towards the end of the editorial that 
        I took great issue with. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It reads, &quot;Academics is only one of many, many things that we do 
        at this College, and to assume that all students, or at least the smart 
        ones, are completely focused on 'excelling' in academics is a serious 
        mistake.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>To say that academics is just one of the &quot;many, many things&quot; 
        we do at this college is literally true, I suppose, but the wording obscures 
        the simple fact that, as full-time students attending an extremely expensive 
        four year college, academics is our first commitment. It is, essentially, 
        our job to excel academically, or at least to do the best we can. Everything 
        else we do here, however passionate we may be about it and however important 
        it may be to us, is of secondary importance to our academic experience.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To use an example, if you asked a neurosurgeon what she did with her 
        time and she answered, &quot;Well, I work at the hospital doing brain 
        surgery and whatnot, but what I spend most of my time doing is publishing 
        the hospital newsletter and coaching my daughter's softball team,&quot; 
        I think you would be inclined to wonder what kind of neurosurgeon she 
        could be if she didn't spend most of her time working at it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While I certainly believe that extracurricular activities are important 
        to our lives here at the College, I don't think that we should let them 
        interfere with what should be our principle activity here.</p>
