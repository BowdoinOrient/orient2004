      <p align="left">Early one morning last week, a hawk killed and ate a gull 
        just outside Smith Union. As I watched from the window nearest the caf&eacute;, 
        small groups of campus pedestrians assembled, grew, observed, then shrank 
        again. Because the facial expressions down there were so generally curious, 
        it seemed a good idea to write a brief profile of the predator that, since 
        early November, has been thriving on the campus.<br>
      </p>

      </table>
      <p align="left">She is an immature red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), 
        probably attracted to the Bowdoin campus and the town mall for their large 
        populations of obese, complacent squirrels. The red-tail is a common hawk 
        throughout North and Central America, and feeds generally on small mammals. 
        But like all predators, the red-tail is an opportunist, and that explains 
        the gull killed outside the Union. Birds are difficult to catch, but those 
        unwise or unsuspecting birds that pass or perch beneath a red-tail are 
        worth a try. Meat is meat.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This red-tail seems relatively large, probably female-in 
        almost all birds of prey, the females are considerably larger than the 
        males. Male red-tails weigh roughly two pounds, and females about three. 
        The females' larger size helps them keep eggs and nestlings sufficiently 
        warm. Different body sizes mean different skills, allowing a brooding 
        pair of hawks to depend on more various prey: the swifter males hunt more 
        mice, voles, chipmunks, and small birds, and the stronger females more 
        gray squirrels, rabbits, and hares-and gulls, apparently.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Among other indications that she is immature, the red-tail 
        on campus does not yet have the red-orange tail of the adult birds, which 
        is particularly visible when they are soaring, backlit by the sun. Since 
        she is in immature plumage, we can be sure she hatched sometime in May 
        or June of 2001 and left the nest about two months later, full-grown. 
        In the coming spring and summer she will moult her feathers gradually 
        to assume full adult plumage. She will not reach sexual maturity until 
        her third year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Any immature hawk seen this time of year has already passed 
        hundreds of survival tests. Mortality among red-tails in their first year 
        is between 70 and 80 per cent; from a healthy brood of three red-tail 
        nestlings, one will survive the winter. First the young hawk must fledge 
        safely, then it must begin to deal with the predator's lifelong struggle 
        against its prey's dislike of being caught: mice and squirrels bite, hares 
        and rabbits kick, birds bite and jab. The slightest injury or infection, 
        if it compromises hunting ability, can cause starvation for most hawks. 
        And learning flight and hunting skills in the colder weather of fall and 
        early winter intensifies all other stress in a young hawk's life.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The campus red-tail has been seen hunting most frequently 
        on the quad, between Smith and Moulton Unions, on the Brunswick town mall, 
        and around Farley Field House. During the winter, red-tails hunt from 
        treetops and other high vantage points. The top of Hubbard Hall is a perfect 
        position for surveying most of campus, and our campus hawk has been seen 
        up there several times. She is not difficult to find in early morning 
        or late afternoon, since she is most active then and is followed by a 
        mob of noisy, persistent crows that may be heard from all corners of the 
        campus. A female red-tail will eat a large meal, like a squirrel, every 
        two to four days, depending on weather.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This winter has been mild, which may explain the high number 
        of red-tails seen in southern Maine recently. Red-tail migration is not 
        as straightforward as in other birds of prey. Although many red-tails 
        migrate south from New England in October and November, many do not, especially 
        when weather is so unseasonably warm. The red-tail on campus will probably 
        remain in the area into the spring, when warm air and high winds will 
        encourage her to fly higher and farther from winter residence.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If you see this hawk chasing or catching prey in the area 
        and are interested in keeping track of her throughout the semester, send 
        me an email (<a href="mailto:amiddlet@bowdoin.edu">amiddlet@bowdoin.edu</a>) 
        and I will write an update later in the semester.</p>
