      <p align="left"><font size="5">Hafler's plans for ceramics department take shape</font><br>
        <font size="2">MAIA LEE<br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Tonight at 6:30 p.m., sophomore Jason Hafler will make 
        history. He will open the first ceramics show ever exhibited at Bowdoin, 
        accompanied by wine, hor d'oeuvres and a host of fans. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Disapointed that ceramics are not offered as a credit level 
        course in the Visual Arts department, Hafler decided to complete an independent 
        study in ceramics last semester. His show, which opens tonight in the 
        basement of the VAC, will consist of approximately fifteen of his favorite 
        pieces, all of which were made on the wheel.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though his independent study involved many hours of hard 
        work, Hafler was no newcomer to ceramics when he came to Bowdoin two years 
        ago. Ever since the eighth grade, he has been designing, exhibiting, and 
        selling his own ceramic pieces. In addition to owning his own wheel back 
        at home, he has a full kiln for firing finished work in his basement.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">His first ceramics exhibition took place several years ago 
        at his high school, Buckingham Brown and Nichols, in Cambridge, MA. As 
        a result of this and other shows, he began to sell some of his ceramics 
        at an early age. Recently he was commissioned to make an entire set of 
        dinner ware for a friend's wedding. This should not be too difficult for 
        Hafler, considering he has previously made a full set for his parents 
        and other relatives. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Here at Bowdoin, his show will focus mainly on platters 
        and cover jars of various sizes and styles. Many of his pieces were inspired 
        by Warren MacKenzie, whose work with ceramics is documented in several 
        books on the subject. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was another great potter, however, who gave Hafler some 
        extra help during his independent study. Tyler Gulden, who runs a nonprofit 
        ceramics facility here in Maine got in contact with him through the help 
        of art professor Mark Wethli. His ceramics program is called Watershed 
        and has proved to be a wonderful resource, especially in the absense of 
        an official ceramics program on the Bowdoin campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, Hafler hopes to change this soon. After discovering 
        that most other small liberal arts schools do in fact offer ceramics for 
        credit, he decided to take on the administration and write a petition 
        asking for the creation of a ceramics program. 400 students signed the 
        petition, and it is currently being looked over by Dean McEwen and Wethli.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What Hafler hopes to achieve will be a program similar to 
        that at Bates. &quot;Under the leadership of Paul Heroux, another well 
        known potter, Bates offers a fantastic program in ceramics,&quot; said 
        Hafler. &quot;My goal is to get a larger building here on campus and a 
        teacher dedicated specifically to ceramics. Then we could take courses 
        for credit as part of the art department.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though Bowdoin still does not offer classes in ceramics 
        for credit, the craft center offers a weekly class taught by Nancy Foushee. 
        After taking a safety course, the craft center is available to all students 
        during the academic year and provides wheels, clay, and other materials, 
        including a photo lab. </p>
      <p align="left">However, before graduating, Hafler hopes to move ceramics 
        from the extracurricular into the course catalog, making it easier for 
        interested student to dedicate more time to it.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for Hafler, who is currently dividing his time between 
        the visual arts major and pre med, any extra time would be well appreciated. 
        He already feels as if he doesn't have enough time to dedicate to ceramics 
        as he would like. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the future, Hafler says he's not planning to pursue ceramics 
        professionally (he wants to be a doctor), but he's certain he will continue 
        this type of work as a hobby. Be sure to stop by and see his creations 
        tonight at 6:30 p.m. in the VAC.</p>
