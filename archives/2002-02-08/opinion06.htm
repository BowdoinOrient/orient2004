        <font size="2">TODD BUELL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Some may wonder what Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) is doing 
        now that he has tabled a vote on President Bush's economic stimulus plan 
        and continues to obstruct numerous presidential nominees. The word in 
        Washington is that he's ordering another caf&eacute;, except this caf&eacute; 
        doesn't come with milk or sugar. It comes the way Democrats like it, as 
        a tax that will damage the economy and has been shown to result in nearly 
        2,000 deaths a year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>What tax am I talking about? Its name seems so benign; it doesn't even 
        include the word 'tax.' However, don't be fooled. According to the Americans 
        for Tax Reform and the Small Business Survival Committee, this regulation 
        will increase the cost of SUVs, minivans, and pickup trucks by up to $2,750. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The proposed change to Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF&Eacute;) will 
        increase will increase the miles per gallon (mpg) federally required for 
        minivans, SUVs, and pickup trucks to 40. The plan's defenders argue that 
        by raising the prices on these &quot;gas guzzling&quot; cars, we are protecting 
        the environment. However, as a panel discussion at the Conservative Political 
        Action Conference (CPAC) pointed out, the logic of the bill is flawed 
        and will result in numerous negative consequences both to jobs and auto 
        safety.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For one thing, there is no guarantee that these regulations will reduce 
        fossil fuel consumption. Congress first enacted these CAF&Eacute; measures 
        in the 1970s, but fossil fuel use has increased since then. One reason 
        for this steady increase in consumption is the decrease in real gas price 
        over the last twenty years. A basic understanding of economics dictates 
        that a price reduction in a high-demand market is usually a consequence 
        of surplus. In plain English, that means we're not running out of oil 
        any time soon. <br>
        The regulation may not even be helping the environment. As Frontiers of 
        Freedom President George C. Landrith points out on his organization's 
        website, consumers hold onto older, less-efficient cars for a longer period 
        of time. Therefore, the high cost of new cars probably does not have the 
        beneficial effects that some environmentalists think it does.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus we are left with a regulation making tenuous environmental claims 
        and with widely recorded consequences in auto safety. As more people buy 
        bigger cars, those who drive smaller cars are placed in more danger. USA 
        Today published an article in 1998 that showed that 46,000 people had 
        died as a result of driving in a small car that collided with a bigger 
        car since the first CAF&Eacute; standard went into effect in 1975. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite numerous claims that SUVs are not safe, government studies show 
        that these claims are greatly exaggerated. Half of all car crashes are 
        single-car accidents. The same studies show that one is much safer in 
        an SUV during a single car crash than in a smaller car. The evidence is 
        inconclusive when it comes to multi-car collisions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although it is irresponsible to suggest that a revocation of CAF&Eacute; 
        would have saved those lives, the statistics prove that there is a safety 
        advantage to having a big car. It is flagrantly hypocritical of populist 
        liberals such as Tom Daschle and John Kerry (D-MA) to claim they are supporting 
        the middle and lower classes while opposing Bush's tax cut, then making 
        it harder for people of low means to purchase safe vehicles. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Not only will increased CAF&Eacute; standards make cars more expensive, 
        but the United Auto Workers Union (not known for its conservative activism), 
        argues that the cost of compliance will result in the loss of 100,000 
        jobs in the auto industry. This is not the sort of stimulus our economy 
        needs as it slowly works its way out of a recession. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that energy conservation is important. However, CAF&Eacute; 
        regulations have not done anything to solve the problem. We are more dependent 
        on foreign oil than we were 25 years ago and the economic success of the 
        1980s and 1990s resulted in people buying more cars. The only effect CAF&Eacute; 
        has had on our society is in the death of innocent drivers who could not 
        afford bigger, safer automobiles. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, gas prices will go up, and auto manufacturers will respond 
        by using renewable energy sources. Until that happens, why compromise 
        the safety of the average American and damage the economy through lost 
        jobs? It seems now that if Daschle gets his way with fiscal policy and 
        CAF&Eacute;, there will be more stimulants in his morning Starbucks visit 
        than in our economy.</p>
