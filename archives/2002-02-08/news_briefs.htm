      <p align="left"><b>UCalifornia thinks twice about SATs</b><br>
        In a move that echoes Bowdoin College's decision in 1970, an advisory 
        board at the University of California is weighing the possibility of relinquishing 
        SAT scores as a part of undergraduate admission.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is feared that in the college admissions process, too 
        great an emphasis is placed upon standardized testing scores and that 
        academic achievement is being left by the wayside.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some feel as if the SAT II tests provide a greater assessment 
        of a student's ability, rather than their scholastic aptitudes, which 
        are limited only to Math and English.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Before the creation of the SATs, many schools relied upon 
        individual tests, created by the individual school's admissions department. 
        The University of California is considering reverting to an applicant 
        test, unique to their university system.</p>
      <p><b>Men arrested in conjunction with Wall Street Journal reporter</b><br>
        The Pakistani police force apprehended two men whom they believe to be 
        the authors of emails containing photographs of Daniel Pearl, an American 
        reporter, being held hostage.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The condition of Pearl, who disappeared in Pakistan 15 days ago, is still 
        unknown at this time. Two emails were sent to various news organizations 
        claiming Pearl to be dead. While the US and Pakistani governments attempted 
        to authenticate these claims, a third email was sent, indicating that 
        Pearl was still alive.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another man, who may be involved with the kidnappers, was also apprehended.In 
        addition, the police obtained the computer that was used to send the emails 
        concerning Pearl.</p>
      <p><b>Immoral Harvard Seniors</b><br>
        Two Harvard Seniors were arraigned Tuesday, in Middlesex Superior Court, 
        under charges of felony larceny.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Suzanne M. Pomey and Randy J. Gomes plead not guilty to accusations that 
        they stole nearly $100,000 from an on-campus theater group.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Hasty Pudding Theatricals are the nations oldest theatrical group, 
        with productions dating back to the nineteenth century; the group was 
        originally founded in 1795.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Both Pomey and Gomes served in high positions within the organization, 
        and thus had access to the theater group's finances. It is alleged that 
        the two credited their own credit cards with the funds of the organization.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Pomey and Gomes were released on their own recognizance and will return 
        to the courtroom on March 28.</p>
      <p><b>BIW to release 70</b><br>
        In a sign of increasingly difficult economic times, Bath Iron Works intends 
        to lay off 70 designers by the first of March.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The profession of design workers is not necessary for the construction 
        of Navy ships, and thus the services of several designers aren't in demand.<br>
        This past December, BIW laid off a group of 35 workers, which included 
        twenty-six designers.</p>
      <p><b>Armed forces releases 27 Afghans</b><br>
        United States armed forces released 27 Afghans on Wednesday, after it 
        was determined that they had no ties to the Taliban or the Al Qaeda. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The men had been held since their initial capture on January 23 in Afghanistan. 
        Currently the United States is holding nearly 500 men who are believed 
        to have connections with the Taliban. 324 are being held in various locations 
        throughout Afghanistan, and 158 are being detained in Guantanamo Bay, 
        Cuba. According to indications from the armed forces, more detainments 
        are to be expected in the near future. </p>
