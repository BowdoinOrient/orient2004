      <p>Last September in this space, the Orient recommended progress on the 
        long-awaited 'student portal' website, which would provide an online gathering 
        place for students, since the <a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu">www.bowdoin.edu</a> 
        site is an online gathering place for prospective applicants, and not 
        too interesting for the rest of us. Nothing much has happened, but instead 
        of retiring the point, we direct attention to a smaller-scale issue. Whatever 
        happened to the senior profiles?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Before this summer's site redesign, each new week saw the arrival of 
        three new 'senior profiles' front and center on the home page. Someone 
        from the College would interview selected seniors about their time at 
        Bowdoin, where they were from, what academic projects they were working 
        on, their experience in athletics, and other topics. Hard-hitting investigative 
        pieces they were not. The profiles are admissions tools-attempts to sell 
        the College through the voices of its most experienced students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite that nature, they were fun to read, and added a human face (three, 
        actually) to our online presence. That presence has been missed, as only 
        two senior profiles have been posted this academic year-one in November, 
        and one in December. In contrast, 86 members of the class of 2001 were 
        profiled.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is an unfortunate contrast. Senior profiles were one part of the 
        webpage that interested current and prospective students alike. In addition, 
        there are a lot of disappointed mothers out there wondering where their 
        child's senior profile is.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The trustees' meeting this weekend will feature discussion on some very 
        broad and difficult topics, including the College's operating budget and 
        the role of athletics in our lives here. If the trustees would like some 
        less weighty discussion topics, with simpler resolutions, the question 
        of senior profiles and how soon they can resume should be taken up. The 
        profiles don't need to be brutally honest assessments of the school. We 
        just want to know how the honors projects are going.<br>

      <p><font size="4"><a name="2"></a>What's next? The wet T-shirt contest?</font></p>
      <p>Anyone walking through Smith Union on Tuesday during the early afternoon 
        most likely encountered the college-aged AT&amp;T representatives. Some 
        were standing at the bottom of the stairs handing out bags of &quot;free 
        stuff.&quot; Others were giving out T-shirts to students in exchange for 
        having their picture taken inside the AT&amp;T &quot;grass hut.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This would be no more unusual than the average advertising campaign carried 
        out in the Union, except for the fact that the female representatives 
        were wearing hip-hugging sarong skirts and mid-drift tops and posing as 
        &quot;models&quot; with the students who chose to have their picture taken.<br>
        It is strange that even as Bowdoin is celebrating 30 years of enrolled 
        women, the College is nevertheless allowing an outside company to come 
        on campus and represent females merely as pretty things to have your picture 
        taken with instead of people to be respected for their intelligence and 
        talents.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thumbs down to AT&amp;T for even conceiving of such a foolish and degrading 
        advertising campaign. Thumbs down to the College for allowing it to be 
        realized.</p>
