      <p align="left"><font size="5">The Super Bowl and terrorism</font><br>
        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></p>
      <p align="left"> It's a story you've all heard before. A few stiff vodka 
        drinks, a few shots of tequila, some domestic beer, a chugging contest 
        or two, and the next thing you know you're babbling incoherently and being 
        asked to leave a party. <br>
        I wasn't offended by being asked to leave, but when Super Bowl Sunday 
        rolled around and I was dealing with a hangover that ranks in my top three 
        (and I assure you this is an illustrious list), I began to worry about 
        my condition. Would I be ready for game time? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At three o'clock, I conceded that I wouldn't be able to 
        besot myself the way any good football fan should on the Super Sunday, 
        and I made the difficult and hard-to-respect decision not to drink. At 
        5:30 I was out of bed and had assumed my appropriate position on the couch. 
        In fact, I had risen just in time to experience the overwhelmingly necessary, 
        undoubtedly relevant, and unrelentingly emotional dramatization of the 
        signing of the Declaration of Independence that preceded the game. I was 
        elated to be wearing my stars and stripes boxers, and after witnessing 
        such a poignant display of American patriotism, I truly was &quot;ready 
        for some football.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The game got off to a fairly predictable start with the 
        Rams taking an early lead. I sat, virtually incapacitated, devoting the 
        whole of my attention to the game. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As it moved toward halftime, things began to get strange. 
        The Patriots took a two-score lead, and as a result of a provocative and 
        mind-numbingly expensive TV ad I began to look at drug-use in a whole 
        new light. The innocence of victimless indulgence had been replaced by 
        the notion that people I know, by purchasing illegal drugs, were complicit 
        in terrorist acts.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of these terrorists called me on the phone and asked 
        if I had seen the ad. I was reluctant to speak with him for fear of being 
        the target of a government investigation, or worse, being implicated in 
        a terrorist plot. He tried to assure me that the ad, which cost the White 
        House $1.6 million to run, was simply an attempt to link the popular war 
        on terrorism to the war on drugs. I quickly dismissed this errant claim 
        as the ranting of a radical and subversive thinker who may or may not 
        have ties to the Al Qaeda network.<br>
        As the third quarter droned on, a meaningless prelude to the excitement 
        that was the fourth quarter, I entered a state of deep contemplation. 
        It just didn't seem possible that an administration with such a strong 
        mandate to govern would spend 1.6 million dollars to make claims that 
        were untrue, or arguments that were flawed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then, the second $1.6 million ad (bringing the total to 
        $3.2 million) aired. I was confronted with the confessions of young boys 
        who admitted to helping terrorists get fake passports, and also confessed 
        to &quot;helping murder families in Colombia.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I was deeply moved by this commercial, and outraged at the 
        confessions of these innocent teens that had gotten involved with terrorism 
        as a direct result of searching for a &quot;good time.&quot; I have never 
        agreed with the use of illegal drugs, but prior to Super Sunday I had 
        always been open-minded enough to turn a blind eye to the indulgence of 
        those I know and occasionally consort with.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Things have changed. How can I, privy to the knowledge that 
        those whom with I am (or was) acquainted have murdered innocent Colombians, 
        sit idly by while terrorists all over the country get high and peacefully 
        enjoy themselves? After witnessing the patriotic pregame display, it just 
        didn't seem right not to act. <br>
        I could always justify my refusal to enter the military and serve my country 
        on the grounds of a general aversion to violence, but now with the evil-doers 
        residing so close to home, I found myself implanted with a deep desire 
        to answer the White House's call to arms. Citizens convicted for marijuana-related 
        offenses only serve an average of ten years in prison, compared with an 
        average of 6.3 years for those convicted of murder. This differential 
        is simply too low. Murderers have a variety of reasons for acting. Finding 
        their wife in bed with a New York Knick, hatred of a particular race or 
        ethnicity, cold blood, insanity, being high. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the other hand, terrorists deliberately target innocent 
        civilians. They are evil, as are the drugs they indulge in. Americans 
        spend 32 billion dollars a year on marijuana, making it our nation's number 
        one cash crop. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This simply cannot continue. That $32 billion could almost 
        cover the $38 billion increase in defense spending Bush has proposed in 
        his recently released budget, and would help clear up confusion over the 
        coinciding of massive increases in defense spending and more tax cuts. 
        This money must be seized at all costs. I am willing to advocate the subjugation 
        of civil liberties, in addition to whatever means our administration deems 
        necessary to seek out these stoned evil-doers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The revelation that at least 70,000,000 million terrorists-an 
        approximation of the number of Americans who have tried marijuana-are 
        living among within our ranks binds us to act, quickly and with great 
        force. If you ask me, those ads were worth the $3.2 million.</p>
