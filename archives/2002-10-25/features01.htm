        <font size="2">TIMOTHY J. RIEMER<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p align="left">This year New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer 
        has focused his attention on Wall Street and ending the spree of corporate 
        crimes that have sprung up this year.</p>
      <p align="left">Spitzer has already reached a $100 million settlement with 
        Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. over allegations that the firm privately criticized 
        stock while publicly praising the same stock to help maintain an investment 
        banking relationship. <br>
        Spitzer is even using ground breaking legal theories to bring some of 
        these criminals down. </p>
      <p align="left">While it is a good thing that Attorney General Spitzer is 
        trying to end this rash of corporate crime, he may-at the same time-be 
        stifling the efficiency of the markets.</p>
      <p align="left">Although it is very true that the alternative (letting investment 
        banks and CEO's lie about earnings and firm profitability) would have 
        had a much worse impact on the markets and the economy as we are seeing 
        now, an overreaction by prosecutors and regulators could have a profoundly 
        negative effect as well. </p>
      <p align="left">An overreaction by prosecutors and regulators could cause 
        analysts to be weary of giving firms positive ratings in the fear of being 
        prosecuted for doing so without good cause. Furthermore an overreaction 
        could cause CEO's and other executives to become extremely weary about 
        taking chances with risky investments. </p>
      <p align="left">While it is true that both analysts and executives should 
        be weary of the risks involved in both of these situations, it also true 
        that an overreaction could cause analysts and executives to be too cautious. 
        The down side of this scenario is that this could prevent capital from 
        getting to the firms that deserve it, resulting in the misallocation of 
        capital. The misallocation of capital, although due to improper information 
        about companies, is the cause of our current and much more serious economic 
        woes than an overreaction would cause.</p>
      <p align="left">Attorney General Spitzer should be acting out against people 
        like former WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers. However, using ground breaking 
        legal theories to do so may be a little dangerous. The conviction of different 
        Wall Street figures, such as Martha Stewart, based on these radical theories 
        could provide the legal precedence for further construal or interpretation 
        of securities law that will make many analysts and executives very queasy 
        about their decisions. </p>
      <p align="left">Right now investors are so uneasy about the state of corporate 
        America that they jump at moments notice from stocks to the relative security 
        of bonds. This is why we are seeing such high levels of volatility in 
        the markets. This is one of the reasons the economy is still struggling. 
        Granted, the conviction of corporate crooks will help soothe the worries 
        of investors, but at the same time the daily news of more and more firms 
        and employees being brought up on charges is as equally upsetting.</p>
      <p align="left">There is a very fine line to walk here. Prosecutors and 
        regulators want to set a strong tone in corporate law that will hopefully 
        prevent further corporate malfeasance, but at the same they should not 
        go to far. In other words, people in the position of Attorney General 
        Spitzer should not make the end of corporate corruption the backdrop of 
        their political platform. This is the type of action that will lead to 
        an overreaction, and most likely more economic troubles. Even if economic 
        troubles resulting from an overreaction are less problematic than those 
        that have resulted from corporate crimes, it does not mean that these 
        crimes should be ignored. </p>
