        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Clich&eacute;s are tired, trite, generally miss the point, 
        and deserve to be mocked, especially when used as substitutes for a real 
        argument. To some degree, all ideologies use slogans or clich&eacute;s 
        to make a point, but peacenik clich&eacute;s are notorious-perhaps just 
        because they are more famous and used more often. Regardless, it is a 
        shame. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Make Love Not War,&quot; &quot;Violence Doesn't Solve 
        Anything,&quot; and &quot;Global Justice&quot; are cute and simple and 
        are easy to chalk on pavement, but they are no more an argument than &quot;I 
        Want Steak For Dinner.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Arguments require substance and should be used to make others 
        question their beliefs. None of the aforementioned statements do, at least 
        to anyone who has thought about an issue for longer than it takes to tie 
        their shoes. No doubt, when plastered around campus, these statements 
        are usually intended just to raise awareness, but even this is a failure; 
        without more to back them up, people are bound to ignore them, or merely 
        echo them, without an understanding of what they mean. </p>
      <p align="left">When used as an argument, such clich&eacute;s represent 
        intellectually lazy people letting prefabricated phrases do their thinking 
        for them. It really is a shame because most people I see who do this are 
        quite smart-Bowdoin caliber, after all. They could probably offer a post-modern 
        deconstruction on anything from Hegel to a Dominoes take-out menu, but 
        they rely on statements with all the depth and originality of &quot;Yankees 
        Suck&quot; to make their arguments for them so often that they cannot 
        be taken seriously. </p>
      <p align="left">The &quot;Does Might Makes Right?&quot; argument is a perfect 
        example of a clich&eacute;d phrase intended to substitute for clear thought. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;Does Might Makes Right?&quot; usually shows up shortly 
        after a statement along the lines of &quot;The United States can and should 
        prevent Saddam Hussein from developing nuclear weapons, even if it requires 
        us to go it alone.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;So, we can impose our will on Iraq because might makes 
        right?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">The &quot;Does Might Makes Right?&quot; question is intended 
        as a rhetorical device to essentially end the conversation. It is one 
        of many debater's tricks used to confuse and confound, and ultimately 
        to change the subject. When confronted with such a statement, one is expected 
        to stutter and grasp at thoughts for a minute before stumbling back to 
        the conclusion that no, might does not make right, but&#133;what was I 
        saying? </p>
      <p align="left">The observant reader will note the subtle switch in the 
        debate, of which sometimes the initiator is even unaware. The debate has 
        moved from the relative threat of Iraq or the morality of unilateralism 
        to whether might, in fact, makes right. This is an entirely different 
        topic.</p>
      <p align="left">Fortunately, there is an easy answer to anyone who uses 
        this approach; No, might does not necessarily make right, but we are lucky 
        that in this case might is on the side of right. </p>
      <p align="left">Consider if the United States dismantled its entire military 
        and was even less mighty than Superman in a Kryptonite prison cell. Would 
        this in any way change the morality of allowing Saddam Hussein to bully, 
        blackmail and murder his way to greater power with the backing of a nuclear 
        arsenal? No, the only thing that would change would be our ability to 
        put a stop to it. </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, one could make the opposite argument, that right 
        makes might. Perhaps America is the mightiest nation in the world by sheer 
        happenstance, but perhaps it is because our policies, institutions and 
        politics are better than anyone else's. That is not to say perfect, just 
        better. </p>
      <p align="left">Is it so hard to believe that a country which values academic 
        freedom, freedom to engage in the market and to live in the manner of 
        one's own choosing would have a stronger economy, civil society, and therefore, 
        a greater influence on the world? And not just in terms of greater military 
        influence, but a greater cultural influence as well? </p>
      <p align="left">There are interesting questions that can be raised if one 
        takes a critical eye to clich&eacute;s. Are there times when it is better 
        to make war than love? Might war be the least bad solution to a problem? 
        Might trying to love our enemy get us killed? Does violence really never 
        solve anything? Did a willingness to use violence not save Jackie Chan's 
        butt countless times? </p>
      <p align="left">People can disagree on what kind of threat Iraq poses, or 
        whether the U.S. needs the United Nations approval for an attack, but 
        both sides need to present real arguments for their case, not something 
        they cribbed off the bumper sticker of a '91 Honda Civic. </p>
