        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Washington, D.C. is a tense city. Over the last three weeks, 
        a sniper has killed ten people and wounded three in a murderous rampage. 
        Reading the major D.C. newspapers, The Washington Post and The Washington 
        Times, helps one grasp the impact the sniper has had on the region. </p>
      <p align="left">High schools have postponed or relocated many football games 
        and other athletic activities. Many communities have cancelled public 
        festivals and outdoor events. The State of Maryland has postponed its 
        hunting season. Judging from the way the metropolitan population altered 
        its daily life, the sniper has reason to believe what he wrote on a Tarot 
        card following one of his early attacks: &quot;Dear policeman, I am God.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yet this mass reaction is not rational when one looks at 
        statistics. Despite the flurry of murders in recent weeks, a recent Washington 
        Times article shows that one's chances of being a victim of the sniper 
        are remarkably low. According to National Safety Council statistics, one 
        has a 1 in 465,000 chance of being killed by the sniper. One has a far 
        greater chance of perishing as a result of an auto accident. The council 
        reports that 100 people die daily in the United States from road accidents 
        and that one's odds of dying in that fashion are 1 in 5,887. </p>
      <p align="left">This means that roughly 2,000 people have died from auto 
        accidents during the three weeks that the sniper has terrorized the D.C 
        area. If one divides the 2,000 deaths by the number of states plus D.C. 
        (51), one gets about 40 traffic deaths per state over the last three weeks. 
        That is four times the number of sniper victims.</p>
      <p align="left">These statistics beg the question: Why does our society 
        obsess over a sniper but complacently accepts deaths in traffic as an 
        inevitable consequence of life?</p>
      <p align="left">One answer lies in how we understand ourselves philosophically. 
        The late contemporary philosopher Leo Strauss argues in his book What 
        is Political Philosophy? that one of the fundamental tenets of modern 
        philosophy is the idea of &quot;conquering chance.&quot; Strauss was referring 
        to the Italian philosopher Machiavelli, who devised aggressive and morally 
        dubious means in his seminal work <i>The Prince</i> to help a prince acquire 
        or maintain his power.</p>
      <p align="left">Strauss knew of course that he was not only describing Machiavelli 
        but was also indicting the way contemporary society views our condition. 
        We attempt to conquer chance in innumerable ways. Everything from the 
        daily weather report to human cloning is a manifestation of the principle 
        that humans not only can fully understand seemingly random events but 
        also that we can conquer them and use them for our own improvement. </p>
      <p align="left">We as a society have become beholden to the principle that 
        we can overcome all of the contingencies and chance that intersperse our 
        existence. This helps to explain why we so easily ignore preventable deaths 
        in auto accidents. We attempt to reassert our control over the situation 
        when we think about these scenarios. How often have we all uttered statements 
        such as &quot;I am a good driver; I won't get into an accident.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cars at least theoretically present us with a way to avoid 
        the risk: one can hopefully drive safe cars, obey the speed limit, live 
        in rural areas (like Maine), or take public transit in a city. The sniper 
        on the other hand has shown that he is willing to kill anyone of any profession 
        at any time. As George Gray the acting director of Harvard's Center for 
        Risk Analysis explains &quot;in this case, it's hard to think of one thing 
        you could do to avoid risk.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The dearth of escape routs around the sniper is the root 
        of our fear of him. He removes us from our protective shell of airbags, 
        seatbelts, exercise, fat-free cream cheese, and all of our other scientific 
        risk buffers that we use to control the most inevitable chance: death. 
        The sniper scares us because he violently reminds us that there are certain 
        things in the world that we cannot control. More precisely, he shows us 
        that we cannot control anything perfectly; even in our most advanced and 
        modern society, some things are always left to chance and no advancement 
        of science or police protection can ever change that fact of life.</p>
