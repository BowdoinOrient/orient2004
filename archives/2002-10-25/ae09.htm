        <b>Kid A</b>: How many Riot Grrrrls <br>
        does it take to screw in a light <br>
        bulb?<br>
        <b>Kid B</b>: I dunno, how many?<br>
        <b>Kid A</b>: Five-one to screw it in <br>
        and four to write a zine about it. </p>
      <p>These are what are referred to as inside jokes. But they go a long way 
        towards defining the subcultures- and warring factions- that came to a 
        head on Monday night at the Roxy in Boston, Massachusetts. The draw was 
        three bands, each with three members, who were touching down in Boston 
        for a tour date. The openers, San Francisco up-and-comers the Quails, 
        were followed by garage rock's shiny new thing the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. But 
        the belles of the ball were the women of West Coast rock sensation Sleater-Kinney, 
        a band that is almost never mentioned in a sentence without the words 
        &quot;critical darlings&quot; or &quot;rock's salvation.&quot; </p>
      <p>If a band's rock star credibility can be gauged by the level of testosterone 
        in the crowd, than these three bands have already earned their place in 
        the pantheon. I use testosterone not as a synonym for masculinity, but 
        for competitiveness, as this was easily the most competitive show I had 
        ever been to. </p>
      <p>Even before the Quails took the stage and displayed their talent for 
        taming a legion of disparate styles into each teeming punk-paced song, 
        you could tell that the crowd was preoccupied with position jockeying 
        and crowd jostling. The pogo stick energy of the Riot Grrrls was trying 
        the patience of the stoically detached Indie Kids, while their own motionless 
        music appreciation and general view-blocking height was rubbing the riot 
        girls the wrong way. It was like watching the Jets and the Sharks rumble 
        over their turf-a good view of the stage-but armed only with steely glares 
        and the occasional well placed elbow. </p>
      <p>Even those in the crowd who had not pledged allegiance to either camp 
        were infected by the tension, and suddenly the shaggy haired individual 
        who had just squeezed their way in front of you represented everything 
        that was amoral and disingenuous in the world. Things were looking bad. 
        By the time the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had finished their own explosive set, 
        full of panting, posing, and throat shredding screams of &quot;Art Star!,&quot; 
        the crowd had collectively crammed forward to the point of combustion. 
      </p>
      <p>Now might be a good time to mention that, despite showing up late, I 
        was four rows from the front. I'm not proud of the dirty tricks it took 
        to get me there, but from this location the musicians of Sleater-Kinney 
        rocked me hard enough to make it all worthwhile. </p>
      <p>Anyone unfamiliar with their music should attend to this deficiency in 
        their life and get familiar with them, but by way of an introduction, 
        Sleater-Kinney is comprised of two guitars (wielded by Corin Tucker and 
        Carrie Brownstein) and a drum set (operated by Janet Weiss). While all 
        of the women contribute vocals from time to time, part of Sleater-Kinney's 
        unique sound comes from Corin Tucker's signature trembling wail. Since 
        their first self titled record came out in 1995, Sleater-Kinney have proved 
        to be masters of consistency without stagnation. You can always count 
        on them to put on a good show-tight and energetic but never overly slick 
        or canned. </p>
      <p>You can also expect that with each successive album they will experiment 
        and improve musically, breaking new ground while simultaneously referencing 
        everyone from the Clash to Led Zeppelin, from the Rolling Stones to the 
        Ramones. Most importantly, however, they remain unfailingly accessible 
        to their fans, play in decent sized venues, and introduce deserving new 
        acts. All these attributes contribute to a deep sense of ownership among 
        Sleater- Kinney's fans, and this ownership multiplied by a couple hundred 
        fans, creates a combustible atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Sleater-Kinney took the stage under the glow of purple light and the 
        suspense inspired by a single chord held until they were in position. 
        It was all very Rock Star. They might have opened their set with &quot;O2&quot; 
        off their most recent album, One Beat, but I really can't say for sure, 
        as I was certainly not taking notes. Whatever they opened with, it rocked 
        the crowd hard enough to shatter the tension bubble, and the masses became 
        angst free-content to bask in the glow of Sleater-Kinney's magnetic appeal.
