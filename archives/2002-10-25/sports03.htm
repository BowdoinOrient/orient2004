      </table>
      <p align="left">Five games into the season, the Polar Bears have taken steps 
        forward in improving their play but many back as well. Due to a 1-4 record, 
        one might deduce that, aggregately, more steps have been taken in the 
        negative direction. Those close to the Bowdoin Men's Football Team bear 
        a differing opinion. </p>
      <p align="left">The team is currently making strides that it did not in 
        the past. In talking to some alumni football players this weekend, conversations 
        to the tone of, &quot;You guys are playing much better than the team has 
        in years&quot; were quite common. Statistically speaking, yes, they have 
        been. That is a main reason why the losses this year have been particularly 
        painful. </p>
      <p align="left">Coaches talk to their teams about the game within a game. 
        This is the battle that each player has with the player of a different 
        team. The Bears, almost all the way across the board, feel that they are 
        winning the game within the game. </p>
      <p align="left">For the most part, their work ethic and emotional connection 
        to the game grants them the strength to win their own personal battles. 
        But in reality, the game within the game stems deeper.</p>
      <p align="left">Vince Lombardi said, &quot;In great attempts, it is glorious 
        even to fail.&quot; Each member of the team will concur that the Bears 
        have put forth incredible attempts this season. Therefore, some glory 
        and sense of satisfaction comes with these attempts. But, the ups and 
        downs of the game within the player is more important than that. To retain 
        the will of a champion is difficult on a team with a losing record. </p>
      <p align="left">This resilience is why every player on the Bowdoin Football 
        team is so admirable. In times of loss, the team still shows up on Monday 
        with a desire to improve. It is an internal battle fought between resilience 
        and surrender. </p>
      <p align="left">The will of the Bears always chooses the prior. Therefore, 
        the battle is not being fought against the other team. The real game is 
        in the mind of the player. First Year Bryan Duggan spoke on the issue 
        and said, &quot;The pure resentment of losing inspires us to improve.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">These are times that try men's souls. To be repeatedly knocked 
        down and to always get up is a quality that exists in every player on 
        the team. The Bears are uniquely tested in ways consistently winning teams 
        are not. Players on winning teams never need to dig for the power to compete. 
        The Bears do this on a daily basis.</p>
      <p align="left">As each player consistently wins more and more internal 
        battles, the wins will come. I have no doubt that every member of the 
        team will pursue the ever-sweeter taste of victory with an intensity that 
        augments by the minute. The wins will come, as the foundation is in place.</p>
