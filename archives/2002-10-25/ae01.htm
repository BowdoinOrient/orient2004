        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Sandi DuBowski is milking his film for all its worth. After 
        spending five years negotiating interviews, traveling the globe in search 
        of sources, and crafting hundreds of hours of footage into a cohesive 
        80-minute documentary, DuBowski is not content to simply sit back and 
        watch as the awards pile up (The Teddy Award for Best Documentary at the 
        Berlin Film Festival, The Mayor's Prize for the Jewish Experience at the 
        Jerusalem Film Festival, The Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at 
        OUTFEST Los Angeles) pile up. No, DuBowski is now launching a national 
        education program based on the film, as well as the fall tour that brought 
        him, and his film, to Bowdoin's Kresge auditorium Tuesday before fall 
        break.</p>
      <p align="left">The film's achievements, and DuBowski's growing plans for 
        it, are even more impressive when the subject matter is considered. The 
        film is called <i>Trembling Before G-d</i>, and it seeks to tell the stories 
        of gay and lesbian Orthodox and Hasidic Jews. A film dealing with such 
        a closeted minority of what is already an often overlooked subset of the 
        population could have easily never found its audience and gone completely 
        unnoticed. </p>
      <p align="left">However, as Bowdoin's Professor Aviva Briefel commented 
        when she introduced DuBowski on Tuesday night, he was &quot;turning the 
        unspeakable into words, and the invisible into images.&quot; The profound 
        difficulty of what DuBowski has sought to create, coupled with the film 
        community's cries of his success, has resulted in a word of mouth wildfire. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The film, brought to Bowdoin as the commencement lecture 
        on the twenty-fifth anniversary Harry Spindel Memorial Lectureship, introduces 
        us to several Orthodox and Hasidic Jews in Israel and the United States 
        who are struggling with the relationship between their sexuality and their 
        religion. </p>
      <p align="left">Devorah, a married Israeli woman with children and grandchildren 
        who told her story under the anonymity of silhouette, realized she was 
        a lesbian only after marriage. David, an Orthodox gay man living in Los 
        Angeles, spent a decade trying to follow the advice of his rabbis and 
        pursuing therapies that would help him change his homosexuality. </p>
      <p align="left">Malka and Leah met in their Orthodox high school and now 
        share a home together, even if it has meant alienating parts of their 
        family and their community. Mark, born in London and sent to Israel by 
        his father after learning of his homosexuality, abandoned his Orthodoxy 
        for many years; however during the period that the film was made, attempted 
        to reinvest himself in this community, despite his homosexuality and HIV-positive 
        status. </p>
      <p align="left">These people, and the other individuals who were willing 
        to tell their story under varying levels of anonymity, share a common 
        burden. Jewish law (or rabbinic law for those engaging in lesbian relationships) 
        forbids them to act upon their homosexuality. It seems that either they 
        must abandon their faith, and often their family and community as a result, 
        or they must live a lie or constantly struggle to change. The problems 
        branch out from here. Devorah describes her greatest regret being the 
        pain she has caused her husband, who can never truly understand her coldness 
        towards him. Malka and Leah worry that, despite devoting their lives to 
        doing good works, they will be denied &quot;a place in the next world 
        with each other.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">In the question and answer segment after the film, DuBowski 
        explained that they tried to stay away from the approach of creating a 
        &quot;video debate&quot;-instead of simply pitting one rabbi's argument 
        against another regarding this issue, they chose to develop an understanding 
        of these peoples' lives. </p>
      <p align="left">The rabbis, both ultra Orthodox and more progressive, seem 
        to agree that that there is almost no way to reconcile homosexuality with 
        Jewish law. This is not nearly as hopeless as it sounds. The reception 
        in the Jewish community has proven that putting a face to this issue, 
        and deftly drawing out the implications for the entire community, will 
        instigate a dialogue. </p>
      <p align="left">DuBowski described just how far reaching this dialogue has 
        become, explaining that, besides screenings across the globe, he has also 
        shown Trembling Before G-d in Mormon communities in Utah, as well as to 
        Orthodox and Hasidic youth who have never seen another film before. Even 
        the Bowdoin audience consisted mostly of community members, many of whom 
        had no direct ties to either the Orthodox or gay community. &quot;I don't 
        know why I decided to come tonight&quot; said one Brunswick local, &quot;I 
        was just a little curious&#133; but now I think everyone should see that 
        movie.&quot;</p>
