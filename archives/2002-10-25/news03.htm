        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p>Better reaction times, smarter kids, better quality of life--can bio-engineering 
        offer these results and more? Or, is the path of genetic improvement too 
        overshadowed by a dark past and, perhaps, a darker future?</p>
      <p>Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University 
        of Pennsylvania, addressed these questions and more in Bowdoin's Arnold 
        D. Kates Science Lecture, entitled Ethics and Neuroscience: Should we 
        place any limits on engineering the brain?, on Tuesday night. </p>
      <p>Caplan began by simply stating that &quot;Yes, I think we should enhance 
        our brains.&quot; However, the arguments that he used to support this 
        statement, the history that the statement recalls, and the moral baggage 
        that his opinion carries with it called to attention a wide range of material.</p>
      <p>The most immediate response to genetic engineering or bio-engineering, 
        said Caplan, is &quot;Yuck.&quot; The reaction is one based more on &quot;ethical 
        intuition,&quot; and, though he admitted that &quot;there may be some 
        truth&quot; in this gut reaction, he emphasized that intuition is the 
        &quot;start of the moral argument, not the end of it.&quot; In fact, Caplan 
        said that if we look back at history, it is sometimes the moments during 
        which we get &quot;past an intuition&quot; that we are able to make the 
        most progress.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Caplan also noted that there have been times in human 
        history when bypassing basic human intuition has had disastrous results. 
        The most blaring historical example of this is the &quot;greatest crime 
        committed in the name of science--the Holocaust.&quot; Many of the experiments 
        done during this gruesome episode of history were for the sake of the 
        &quot;improvement of the species&quot;- which was what Nazi eugenics was 
        all about. </p>
      <p>Caplan acknowledged that, even though the holocaust was horrific and 
        done in the name genetic improvement, the Nazis were applying this improvement 
        to a group of people rather than to individuals. Today, when bioengineering 
        is considered as a means of improving the brain, such improvements are 
        on an individual level. Furthermore, while the Nazis enforced these improvements 
        by means of coercion, present day bioengineering is based on individual 
        choice and consent. Thus, &quot;it is not fair to lump together all eugenics 
        with the outcomes and the processes used during the Holocaust.&quot;</p>
      <p>Having addressed the historical arguments about genetic improvements, 
        Caplan discussed problems associated with availability of bioengineering. 
        He said, &quot;If these technologies come to pass, there will be great 
        inequity,&quot; not only between social classes within the United States, 
        but also between developed and underdeveloped countries. Caplan admitted 
        that he is &quot;very concerned about inequity but those are not arguments 
        against improvement, those are arguments against inequity;&quot; a problem 
        which can be solved through laws concerning the technologies available.</p>
      <p>However, according to Caplan, not only are there inherent arguments against 
        bio-engineering, there are also inherent arguments in human nature in 
        favor of the improvements made available by present day technology and 
        genetic research. &quot;Every ethical code says that the number one duty 
        of the parents is to make it better for your kids.&quot; This is true 
        across cultures, across classes, and across the globe. </p>
      <p>In response to the question of limiting the engineering of the brain, 
        Caplan commented that because it is the inherent moral attitude of each 
        individual to improve the lot of those whom they beget, such improvements 
        will essentially be limitless. </p>
