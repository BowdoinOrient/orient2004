        <font size="2">ACADIA SENESE</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I embarrass myself daily. From stepping on the sparkling 
        clean, mirror-like boots of a Marine nice enough to hold open the door 
        for me to turning fire truck cherry-red at the hint of a faux pas, there 
        is never a dull-or should I say unnoticed-moment in my life.</p>
      <p align="left">My embarrassing moments started at a young age, and it was 
        not before long that I realized I was never meant to be an orator. Kindergarten 
        show-and-tell was the first indicator that speaking in front of a group 
        was not going to be my elementary school forte. I only wish now that my 
        fourth grade teacher had realized this before she nominated me to be my 
        town's student &quot;Veteran's Day&quot; speaker.</p>
      <p align="left">November 11 will be a day of infamy. I was given a poem 
        to memorize, and at our town's ceremony was to recite it in front of an 
        overwhelmingly large crowd. I was up to the challenge, and determined 
        to overcome my fear of public speaking. Diligently I memorized the poem, 
        and practiced day after day. By the time Veteran's Day rolled around, 
        I was well and ready.</p>
      <p align="left">The ceremony began quite uneventfully, and I scanned the 
        crowd for familiar faces as I sat on stage. Our town veterans proudly 
        wore their medals of honor, and my entire school, as well as most of the 
        community, gathered to honor them. American flags blew in the wind, and 
        I sat rehearsing my lines.</p>
      <p align="left">Before long, I was called to the pulpit. It was at that 
        moment, that adrenaline rushed through my body as if I was being hunted 
        by a saber tooth tiger. My hands began to quiver, my mouth dried, and 
        my eyesight blurred. But I still believed I could deliver the poem. I 
        meandered to the pulpit, took one scan of the crowd, and froze like that 
        same saber tooth tiger caught in the ice age.</p>
      <p align="left">I was paralyzed. I couldn't move, I couldn't talk, I couldn't 
        even whisper. No sounds of any nature could escape my mouth. A mime would 
        have been more audible than me at that moment. I knew I had to talk, or 
        remove myself from the podium. Cold, cruel stares pierced me from the 
        audience, and fear froze me like I had never been stunned before. My mind 
        was racing, and my body couldn't react. I was utterly mortified.</p>
      <p align="left">And so, after a long, excruciating pause in front of the 
        entire crowd, my school's principle-out of pity, out of sympathy, out 
        of a necessity to get my sorry 4th grade butt down from the stage-came 
        to the podium, whispered some remark to the audience about my IQ ranking 
        amongst the extinct Dodo bird, took my hand, and removed me from the stage. 
        It was the last time a teacher ever nominated me to speak in front of 
        a crowd. They should have asked me to lead a moment of silence.</p>
      <p align="left">But as with any weakness, I confronted my fear of public 
        speaking head on. I forced myself to forget the paralyzing fear I felt 
        in front of a large crowd, and throughout high school continued to push 
        myself to speak in front of others. While I no longer despise public speaking 
        like I once had, I still have plenty of other embarrassing moments to 
        mull over. And if there is one certainty, it's that I will still turn 
        bright red on the drop of a dime, especially if I just left my clumsy 
        muddy footprint on the spotless shoe of an attractive Marine. </p>
