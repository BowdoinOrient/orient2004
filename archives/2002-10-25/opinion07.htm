      <p align="left"><font size="5">Uncovering the Complex Covers Controversy<br>
        <font size="2">MACAELA FLANAGAN</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I once read somewhere that four out of five people fear 
        change in some form or another. That said, one would not assume that the 
        complex art form that is the cover song would have much audience approval, 
        since a cover song is a remake of the original. Despite this statistic, 
        covers have managed to become an integral part of the music industry; 
        not to mention that remaking songs has provided a huge economic boost 
        to all those bars with house bands that don't have an original song on 
        their set list.</p>
      <p align="left">First off, I should expand on these bands that lack original 
        material. They don't just live in the bars anymore. Me First and the Gimmie 
        Gimmies have based their entire punky output on covers from Dylan to show 
        tunes. They seem to be well loved in their domain, but they can get old 
        pretty quickly in my opinion. Nonetheless, there is something shockingly 
        pleasing about fusing Barry Manilow and fast punk.</p>
      <p align="left">Making a cover unique is one of the keys to its musical 
        (but not necessarily its commercial) success. The Flying Lizards do a 
        demented cover of James Brown's &quot;Sex Machine.&quot; The fact that 
        it adapts the soul daddy's energetic vocals into a dull monotonous hum 
        makes it stand on its own. It's sort of like the Backstreet Boys in that 
        listening to it more than once makes you want to throw your stereo out 
        the window, but its experimental nature makes it worth checking out.</p>
      <p align="left">Covers are interesting pieces of musical history because 
        not only do they allow different artists to experiment with songs, but 
        a familiar song in one genre of music can be completely transformed in 
        another. &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; can be found in both the reggae 
        and rock sections of your favorite CD shop. Bob Marley's original is one 
        of the reggae god's most well-known songs, yet it leads a second (and 
        not so special) life as a greatest hit on The Cream of Eric Clapton as 
        well.</p>
      <p align="left">In my musical snobbery days, I found it strange when covers 
        became enormously successful. It seemed to me the original should be the 
        most famous version, yet I have grown to appreciate covers like I appreciate 
        a Duchamp ready-made: a creative adaptation of a well known thing. What 
        musicians can do with a song they really connect with, even if they didn't 
        write it, can be amazing&#133;or appalling.</p>
      <p align="left">Regardless of my view of covers as acceptable music or not, 
        there are many instances when we catch ourselves more attached (or at 
        least more familiar) with the cover as opposed to the original. Aretha 
        Franklin's infamous &quot;Respect&quot; isn't her baby at all, but written 
        by the late and lovely Otis Redding. While Otis is certainly well known, 
        Aretha's version is one of the most popular and empowering songs in modern 
        music history. The same is true for Jimi Hendrix's &quot;All Along the 
        Watchtower&quot;. Hendrix does a marvelous job making it his own unique 
        piece although Dylan was really the originator. Either way, I don't think 
        Hendrix or Dylan ever did anything I couldn't find some bit of pleasure 
        in. But they are the minority&#133;</p>
      <p align="left">Britney Spears' cover of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; 
        is the worst cover I have ever heard in my life. I'm not kidding. I almost 
        cried when I heard it, on top of feeling alarmingly nauseous. Why she 
        thought she could successfully make a cover of one of the anthems of rock 
        and roll is beyond me, but someone should have clued her in. It would 
        have saved her a lot of embarrassment and spared the rest of us the horror. 
        I could fill my 700 word limit with reasons why it sucks, but I'll save 
        my rant and let you listen to it for yourself. You'll know exactly what 
        I am talking about after you hear it. The reason I despise Spears's cover 
        is not based solely on the fact that I'm a Stones fan-and I'll prove it 
        by throwing some love to Devo's quirky cover of &quot;Satisfaction.&quot; 
        It's pretty fun, baby baby baby&#133; </p>
      <p align="left">In review, there are two ways to view covers: they either 
        add creativity or they suck the song dry. Some make you want to dance, 
        some make you want to cry, and some are much better than a lot of the 
        junk being released as original music today anyway. Is it worth living 
        in a world with covers? Well, would you rather live in an emptier existence 
        without the Talking Heads' &quot;Take Me to the River&quot; and Jane's 
        Addiction's &quot;Sympathy for the Devil,&quot; or in a cheesier world 
        with Puff Daddy's &quot;Come with Me,&quot; a total rip-off of &quot;Kashmir&quot; 
        and Marilyn Manson's horrendous remake of &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;? That's 
        a tough one.</p>
