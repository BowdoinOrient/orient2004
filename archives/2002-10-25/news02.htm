      <p>Between a highly competitive job market and a sluggish economy, the job 
        search beyond Bowdoin can be a daunting, even terrifying process for seniors. 
        However, Bowdoin's Alumni Career Programs and the Career Planning Center 
        aim to alleviate this anxiety of job-seeking students. Both programs help 
        students research a variety of career options and establish a network 
        of connections.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, October 18, the Alumni Career Programs and the Career Planning 
        Center dedicated an afternoon to further assist students in their quests 
        for jobs by co-sponsoring the Beyond Bowdoin Career Panel Discussions. 
        Representing an extensive array of career fields, 22 alumni served as 
        panelists and shared their job-related experiences with current students. 
        Students had the opportunity to ask questions about everything from environmental 
        consulting to graphic design. </p>
      <p>Director of Alumni Career Programs Lisa Tessler played a key role in 
        the planning and generation of the event. According to Tessler, one of 
        the main objectives underlying the discussions was the exploration of 
        the ways that a liberal arts education can be used in a variety of settings. 
        Tessler said that the event was intended to &quot;help students who may 
        not know what they want to do but know their skills. The analytical, qualitative, 
        and communicative skills cultivated at Bowdoin have a value in the marketplace.&quot;</p>
      <p>A prominent topic throughout the discussions was the endless value that 
        a liberal arts education can have in the workplace. Panelist Dale Arnold, 
        sports talk show host and television announcer, said that the Bowdoin 
        education &quot;serves as a base that will lead to everything else. A 
        liberal arts education is better than a communications degree. It's not 
        going to matter if you don't have hands on experience-you'll get experience.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Fellow panelist Kevin Newbury, theater director and supervisor, echoed 
        Arnold's affirmation that a liberal arts education is a priceless resource. 
        Newbury said that his Bowdoin bred &quot;ability to manage, analyze things, 
        and write effectively&quot; helps him greatly in his daily job experiences.</p>
      <p>The panel discussions also emphasized the need for change and flexibility 
        within the job search. After the event, senior Liz Wendell said, &quot;I 
        started to consider jobs that had never even been on my list before. I 
        realize that no one finds their fit right after college; you find something 
        that will be an approximate stepping stone to a later career. The panels 
        took a load of stress off my shoulders.&quot;</p>
      <p>Following the discussions was a reception for the speakers and the guests, 
        giving students a chance to establish connections with alum and ask them 
        additional questions. Tessler hoped that the event would stress the importance 
        of networking. &quot;Networking goes a long way to helping you find your 
        niche in the world,&quot; Tessler said. This spring, the Alumni Career 
        Programs and Career Planning Center will host additional networking events 
        and discussions, giving students numerous opportunities to establish a 
        Bowdoin based link with the outside world. </p>
