      <p align="left"> Do you like scary movies?</p>
      <p align="left">No, I don't mean the kind of slasher crap that question 
        made you think of, but the real deal-the un-gory, un-sexy, unmerciful 
        psychological thriller that blast you out of your seat like minefields, 
        and leave you shaking like a freakin' chihuahua as you put the key in 
        the ignition and drive the hell away. Ironically, the genius of these 
        films is that they don't require any thought whatsoever, because no matter 
        how carefully you think you're sneaking through its turf, those mines 
        are gonna blow you right back into submission. You may as well be blind.</p>
      <p align="left">That kind of unconquerable suspense requires major cinematic 
        skill-a piercing mastery of timing, radical domination of music, and irrational 
        exploitation of editing. </p>
      <p align="left">The Ring has got this skill; it's got it bad-and it surges 
        through the film like a two-hour seizure. </p>
      <p align="left">The plot begins like this: four teenagers die grotesque 
        but unexplainable deaths at the exact same time miles apart. Driven by 
        a personal connection to one of them, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts, Mulholland 
        Drive) digs deeper and discovers that the culprit is a mysterious videotape 
        that dooms all those who watch it to death in exactly seven days-a tape 
        she watched. In the next seven days, she, her boyfriend Noah (Martin Henderson) 
        and her son Aidan (Davdi Dorfman) uncover the mysteries of the tape in 
        an attempt to save themselves. </p>
      <p align="left">Read critic's reviews and you'll see them tear up this story 
        for what it doesn't explain. But that's not even the issue; they're missing 
        the point entirely. The core of this film is visual; the story is just 
        the background. It's important, yes, but definitely not the active ingredient. 
        The images are the monster here. The killer works through a videotape, 
        after all, a tape made up of solely images with no narrative whatsoever. 
        Fear doesn't require explanation. In fact, it's far, far more efficient 
        without it. </p>
      <p align="left">What is so scary? A pale little girl with her hair draped 
        over her face walking toward you. A chair spinning around statically in 
        the air. A stone well in the middle of a field. A blank television screen. 
        Nothing like what you'd expect. And then there's the ring; the image you 
        see before you die. Sound random? It's not. Every random image on the 
        tape, the teens' deaths, the seven days, all have a reason for being; 
        this isn't a cheap horror flick where the killer is just a guy with an 
        axe whose mother didn't love him. All these images actually end up tying 
        together all the elements of the mystery into its twisted, haunting resolution.</p>
      <p align="left">With this electric lab experiment in visual suspense, director 
        Gore Verbinski (figures) seems to have finally found his calling. His 
        last project, The Mexican in 2001, pissed a lot of people off: critics, 
        viewers, and, of course, Mexicans. Unlike that disaster, this film is 
        tighter and more potent. It knows what it's doing and loves it.</p>
      <p align="left">There is a downside for actors acting in pure horror movies-they 
        can never win any awards for their performances. It just doesn't take 
        that much talent to scream and jump and stare openmouthed, and even when 
        they manage to inject a special spunk to their high-pitched scenes, most 
        of the audience is too scared to watch anyway. That being said, Naomi 
        Watts did the best she could. Rachel is not a particularly nice woman; 
        we root for her only because we want to find out what's really going on. 
        But it's quite intriguing to watch her ruthlessness take over her character 
        as the movie progresses.</p>
      <p align="left">The other actors didn't go far beyond their expectations 
        either, though it is worth mentioning that Daveigh Chase, who plays Samara 
        Morgan, the freakiest little girl demon since Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist, 
        last worked on Disney's Lilo and Stitch as the voice of Lilo. Now that's 
        versatility.</p>
      <p align="left">The Ring will be one of the most frightening films you've 
        ever seen. Short of closing your eyes for the entire film, you can't escape 
        it. So just take a deep breath, watch closely, and get ready to jump.
