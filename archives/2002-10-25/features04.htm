        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        </font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;I keep coming across information that 
        &quot;safer sex&quot; isn't nearly safe enough. The argument seems to 
        be that condoms do not adequately protect against STD's, especially HPV, 
        and that the only &quot;Safe sex&quot; is &quot;NO SEX&quot;. What do 
        you think?&quot; P.S.</p>
      <p>Dear P.S.: I've seen some of that information, sometimes put out by medical 
        authorities, and always promoting abstinence as the only safe option. 
        For many, abstinence may in fact be a good choice. For many others, however, 
        the issues may not seem so black-and-white.</p>
      <p>Health educators suggest we think through the risks of sex and safer 
        sex like we do other risks in life, such as driving a car. Some of us 
        choose not to drive for fear of getting hurt in an accident. Most people 
        seem willing to accept some level of risk, and try to find ways to reduce 
        it. They wear seat belts, maintain their cars, drive defensively, and 
        avoid driving after drinking or in bad weather.</p>
      <p>People have safer sex to protect themselves and their partners from STD's 
        and from unplanned pregnancies. They understand that sex is more enjoyable 
        if they are not afraid. Safer sex is about what they do, or don't do, 
        and not about who they are. It is about figuring out their own &quot;risk 
        limits,&quot; and then avoiding sexual activities that fall outside of 
        them. </p>
      <p>Safer sex practices require self-reflection, a great deal of communication 
        between partners, and some familiarity with the &quot;tools of the trade,&quot; 
        especially condoms.</p>
      <p>A 1996 consensus panel at the National Institutes of Health reviewed 
        studies on Human Papilloma Virus, cervical cancer, and condoms. This panel 
        reported controversy over the scientifically-proven protective efficacy 
        of condoms against HPV. </p>
      <p>&quot;Abstinence Only&quot; campaigns have focused in on this one small 
        part of the NIH report, and use it to instill fear and to further their 
        own political agenda. <br>
        The Heritage Foundation, for instance, always refers to HPV as &quot;the 
        deadly HPV,&quot; even though more than 99 percent of people who contract 
        the virus never die from it. Representative Billy Tauzin-Republican representative 
        for Lousiana and Chair of the House Commerce and Energy Committee-has 
        been pushing for legislative action that would require condom packages 
        to carry a warning label about not being protective against HPV, &quot;the 
        cause of nearly all cervical cancer.&quot;</p>
      <p>Human Papilloma Virus is by far the most prevalent of the sexually transmitted 
        infections. The numbers involved are truly staggering. It is estimated 
        that 75 percent of sexually active people contract HPV at one time or 
        another, and that at any given point in time, 20 million Americans have 
        genital HPV infections that can be transmitted to others. </p>
      <p>Every year, over 5.5 million people become infected. Very fortunately, 
        however, the majority of HPV infections are overcome by our immune systems 
        and resolve without further complications. </p>
      <p>Two of the over 30 sexually transmissible strains of the virus, though, 
        cause cellular changes which can lead to cancer. In particular, cervical 
        cancer is virtually always associated with untreated HPV Type 16 or Type 
        18. </p>
      <p>Cancer of the cervix is one of the most common malignancies in women, 
        accounting for nearly 16,000 new cases and almost 5,000 deaths in the 
        U.S. each year. It is also one of the most treatable and preventable cancers. 
        Microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix is nearly alway curable surgically. 
        More importantly, it has a long pre-clinical phase which permits early 
        detection. </p>
      <p>In fact, regular screening Pap smears very effectively pick up early, 
        pre-cancerous changes, and treatment at these early stages is curative. 
        More than half of women newly diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer 
        have never had a Pap smear, and another 10 percent have not had one in 
        the previous 5 years. Cervical cancer may indeed be an HPV-related &quot;STD&quot;, 
        but it is more importantly a disease of medical neglect.</p>
      <p>Now, back to condoms! Because HPV can infect genital areas not covered 
        by condoms, condoms provide incomplete protection against the spread of 
        HPV. This is the crux of the &quot;No such thing as safer sex&quot; argument: 
        &quot;HPV is rampant, cannot be fully prevented by condom use, and by 
        causing cervical cancer, kills thousands of women each year.&quot; </p>
      <p>The suggested solution? Abstinence, followed by lifelong, mutually monogamous 
        marriage.</p>
      <p>Obviously this argument oversimplifies and distorts many of the critical 
        elements of the problem mentioned above. It is also important to note 
        that, according to this same NIH report, condoms do in fact offer not 
        just some, but some VERY worthwhile protection against HPV, particularly 
        against cervical infection. Even more importantly, condoms offer VERY 
        effective protection against the spread of HIV, an STD that has claimed 
        almost 500,000 American lives over the past 20 years, and which threatens 
        to kill untold tens of millions more around the world. </p>
      <p>Condoms also offer VERY effective protection against chlamydia, an STD 
        that infects over 3 million people in this country each year. </p>
      <p>Condoms, finally, also offer reasonably effective protection (about 85 
        percent) against unwanted pregnancies. From a public health standpoint, 
        it seems to me simply criminal to discourage condom use.</p>
      <p>Total abstinence would presumably offer nearly 100 percent protection 
        against STD's and unplanned pregnancies. And for some people, abstinence 
        remains the best choice. For others, however, it is not. And those individuals 
        need useful, scientific information to make their own best choices. </p>
      <p>Take a look at the Health Center webpage. Talk to someone at the Health 
        Center, the Counseling Center, or the Women's Resource Center. Talk to 
        members of the Bowdoin Gay/Straight Alliance or HIV/AIDS Peer Educators. 
        Check out cdc.gov, consensus.nih.gov, goaskalice.columbia.edu, fenwayhealth.org, 
        or ourbodiesourselves.org. And to be fair, take a look at heritage.org, 
        medinstitute.org and worththewait.com.</p>
      <p>Think hard for yourselves, and take good care of yourselves-and each 
        other!</p>
