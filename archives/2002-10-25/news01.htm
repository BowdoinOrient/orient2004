      <p align="left">Time will tell how the Bowdoin Outing Club's new home, the 
        Schwartz Outdoor Leadership Center, will shape the students, BOC members, 
        and faculty that will pass through its doors; but the atmosphere at its 
        dedication on Friday, October 18 indicated that those changes will be 
        positive. </p>
      <p align="left">A reception attended by trustees, administrators, and students 
        was held at 5:30 p.m. in the new building. Remarks were given by President 
        Barry Mills '72, Director of the Outing Club D. Michael Woodruff '87, 
        Allison M. Binkowski '03, and trustee Steven M. Schwartz '70 and his wife 
        Paula Mae Schwartz, who donated the lead gift for the building. The value 
        of outdoor education was a common thread through all the speeches. All 
        who attended the dedication received a free t-shirt commemorating the 
        event. The shirt, gray with green trim, features a drawing of the OLC 
        and the Churchill quote.</p>
      <p align="left">After Chair of the Board of Trustees Donald M. Zuckert '56 
        opened the ceremony, Mills gave the welcome. The President shared some 
        anecdotes of his recent adventures in the outdoors with his wife, Woodruff, 
        and Associate Vice President for Development and Alumni Relations Scott 
        Meiklejohn, and remarked on the role of the Outing Club, Bowdoin's most 
        popular student organization. </p>
      <p align="left">Woodruff thanked the donors and paid tribute to Jim Lentz, 
        Bowdoin's football coach from 1968 to 1983, who was hired in 1984 as the 
        BOC's first full-time director. </p>
      <p align="left">Binkowski, the BOC's Hiking Club head and Equipment Room 
        Manager, reflected upon the BOC's impact on her Bowdoin career and remarked 
        on how the new facility has made her job as Equipment Room Manager much 
        easier than when BOC equipment was stored in &quot;the dungeon&quot; of 
        Burnett House's basement. She then presented a polar bear welcome mat 
        to the Schwartzes. </p>
      <p align="left">Steven Schwartz also commented on the importance of outdoor 
        education. He characterized the OLC as &quot;a thank you to Bowdoin.&quot; 
        Paula Schwartz talked about some outdoor adventures with her husband and 
        said, &quot;I hope that the Schwartz Outdoor Leadership Center will provide 
        good feelings for all of you, inside and out.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Schwartz was a James Bowdoin Scholar and member of Phi 
        Beta Kappa. He graduated magna cum laude with a Government major and English 
        minor. He founded Schwartz Communications with Mrs. Schwartz in 1990. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The event capped off a big day for the Outing Club. Jill 
        Fredston, co-director of the Alaska Mountain Safety Center and one of 
        America's leading avalanche experts, visited campus. Fredston has worked 
        on mountain stunts and safety for several feature films, including Seven 
        Years in Tibet. She is also a master rower. Fredston spoke at Common Hour 
        about her book Rowing to Latitude: Journeys Along the Arctic's Edge, which 
        relates to her many rowing expeditions along Greenland, Alaska, Norway, 
        and more. </p>
      <p align="left">Fredston gave two classes for BOC leaders while she was 
        here. In the morning she talked about avalanche knowledge and in the afternoon 
        she gave a workshop on leadership and decision-making skills. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;She was very informative and a wonderful speaker, 
        very personable, and an inspiration to all of us that are interested in 
        outdoor activities and making a life out of them,&quot; said Laura Jefferis 
        '05, who attended the afternoon class.</p>
      <p align="left">The OLC opened this summer and was used to launch the annual 
        pre-orientation trips for the Class of 2006. The building was designed 
        by Richard Renner at Van Dam &amp; Renner Architects of Portland and features 
        the environment-friendly &quot;green design.&quot; The 1.25 million dollar 
        facility includes staff offices, a map room, a kitchen, an equipment room, 
        and trip lockers around the central Beebe Room, which was provided by 
        a donation from E. Colman Beebe '33 and his wife Janet M. Beebe. </p>
      <p align="left">The Beebe Room features the James S. Lentz Hearth, dedicated 
        to the Outing Club Director Emeritus and built using contributions from 
        many of the football players Lentz coached at Bowdoin and Harvard. The 
        room now has furniture around the hearth and is decorated with student 
        art and donated snowshoes, skis, and a moose head.</p>
