        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p>The past five years in the United States have been one of the darkest 
        periods in mainstream music. The staleness of early 90s rip-off bands 
        and overblown teen sensations has ruined any hope of an American music 
        revival. All the while, the Brits have been have been enjoying much more 
        prosperity fueled by the dynamics of bands, both new and old, who are 
        interesting and who constantly push the boundaries. </p>
      <p>After Coldplay, the new heroes of British radio, broke into to the world 
        of Britpop with their 2000 release, Parachutes, they went into the studio 
        in 2001 looking to redefine themselves and make an album with a little 
        bit more ambition. </p>
      <p>A Rush of Blood to the Head (rumored by the band to be their last album) 
        truly finds Chris Martin and company in their best form. </p>
      <p>Coldplay took what they did best on its last effort and added a bit of 
        edge and energy that Parachutes certainly lacked. While many of the yearning 
        love songs from Parachutes were certainly great in their own right, they 
        lack the depth and power of most of the material that these Londoners 
        put forth on this latest release.</p>
      <p>The opening track, &quot;Politik,&quot; pulsates with an urgency that 
        is entirely new to Coldplay, and the Britpop scene. It immediately builds 
        its tension around a pounding three chord sequence that only moments later 
        moves into a chilling chorus that would raise the hairs on the neck of 
        any battle hardened Britpop fan. Nonetheless, it is, like the rest of 
        the album, still distinctively Coldplay.</p>
      <p>However it feels not only haunting, but absolutely sincere, unlike some 
        of the tracks on Parachutes which seem years behind the progession of 
        A Rush of Blood to the Head. This feeling is once again very clear on 
        &quot;A Whisper&quot; and &quot;God Put a Smile Upon Your Face,&quot; 
        which find Coldplay at their most experimental.</p>
      <p>The only flaw that the Coldplay team made with A Rush of Blood to the 
        Head was the lead single, &quot;In My Place.&quot; Not only is it not 
        up to par with the singles from Parachutes, but it doesn't show the casual 
        listener the songwriting leaps that this quartet made in the past two 
        years. </p>
      <p>The piano-ballad, &quot;The Scientist,&quot; is by far the best track 
        that Coldplay has ever done, and one of the best songs to come from the 
        Britpop scene in years. It combines Bono's vocals of Achtung Baby and 
        the feeling of early Radiohead circa The Bends to create a moment, coupled 
        with their new edge, that alone warrants the purchase of the album.</p>
      <p>The following track, &quot;Clocks,&quot; combines this same magic with 
        the distinctive Coldplay sound to truly convince the listener that Coldplay 
        has finally found what they were looking for. </p>
      <p>On the previous outing, Coldplay created an album that was cohesive and 
        beautiful, but never spectacular. This time around, they create a feel 
        that is much more eclectic as songs like &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;The 
        Scientist&quot; fit perfectly into the mix of louder tracks like &quot;Politik.&quot; 
        Consequently, some much-needed diversity is added to the mix. Now let's 
        just hope that Coldplay will stay together and amaze us again. </p>
