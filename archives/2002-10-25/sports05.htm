      <p align="left">Although last Saturday's 19-17 loss to Colby ended the regular 
        season on a decidedly sour note, the ruggers in black have plenty to smile 
        about these days. Currently, they are preparing to travel to suburban 
        Boston tomorrow and face off against Babson College, Middlebury College, 
        and the United States Coast Guard Academy in the 2002 New England Division 
        II Championships.</p>

      <p align="left">Before a huge gathering of rugby alumni during Homecoming 
        weekend, both teams put on a show in a game that went back and forth until 
        the last seconds ticked away. Bowdoin still held the lead by the end of 
        the first half, but Colby quickly came back, and managed to sneak by with 
        a two-point lead going into the final minutes of the game.</p>
      <p align="left">Dennis Kiley '03 gave the Bowdoin fans quite a stir when 
        he scored what appeared to be a game-winning try with only a few minutes 
        left in the game. Kiley grabbed the ball on a breakaway and burned every 
        Colby rugger on his way to the try zone. But before anyone could break 
        out the champagne, Kiley was called for a knock-on way back at the other 
        side of the pitch, and the try did not count. </p>
      <p align="left">In the final seconds of the game, Bowdoin was able to push 
        all the way to Colby's five-meter line, but time ran out before Bowdoin 
        had a chance to make a run for the try zone, and Colby left the field 
        victorious.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We played a good game, but Colby was pretty evenly 
        matched against us,&quot; said coach Rick Scala. &quot;[Colby] did an 
        excellent job playing to the referee, and they had a very talented team. 
        We could have done some things better, but it's hard to be disappointed 
        when we are the team going to playoffs [this] weekend.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Even though Colby beat Bowdoin, both teams finished the 
        season with a record of 4-1-0, as did the University of Maine at Orono; 
        because Bowdoin had the highest point differential among the three clubs, 
        Bowdoin was declared the conference champion.</p>
      <p align="left">After Colby departed for lovely Waterville, the Bowdoin 
        ruggers and alums relocated to the adjacent pitch to play an alumni match, 
        something that has become a tradition every few years during homecoming 
        weekend. </p>
      <p align="left">The match saw the participation of many illustrious Bowdoin 
        rugby alumni, and most of the players were still in good enough shape 
        to play five, and in some cases ten minutes before needing a substitution. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Without question, the finest performance of the alumni match 
        was turned in by Aryeh &quot;ajasper28&quot; Jasper '02, whose quick feet 
        and unstoppable speed made him nearly impossible to stop on the pitch. 
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;I have been sticking to a pretty rigorous fitness 
        schedule these days,&quot; remarked Jasper after the match. &quot;My job 
        in the advertising industry is extremely demanding, both psychically and 
        mentally. If I didn't take care of myself, I don't know how I would last 
        in such a high-pressure environment.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Another surprise performer of the day was Hugh &quot;Hank&quot; 
        Hill '02, who became the first rugby alum to ever participate in a match 
        holding a lit cigarette in his mouth. When asked about his performance, 
        Hill was quite sentimental. &quot;I (cough) loved playing rugby when (cough) 
        I was a student here, and I was so excited about (cough) coming back up 
        to Bowdoin and (cough) reliving some of my glory days. Now, (cough) have 
        you seen what happened to my bottle of scotch?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Alan &quot;Beaker&quot; Barr '02 played in the first half 
        of the match, but unfortunately had to take an important phone call and 
        leave the pitch before the game was through. &quot;There are few things 
        in life I love more than playing rugby,&quot; he said, &quot;But when 
        [my life partner] Mary Jane dials up, you have to answer the call.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Some of the current ruggers got a chance to get in on the 
        action during the alumni game, and no one was more excited about this 
        than freshman forward Ross Butschek. &quot;I have had a lot of fun this 
        season, and I think I am getting a better understanding of how rugby works. 
        I know this is only my first year, but I had some great runs in some of 
        the matches, and I haven't dropped the ball once. It's like I'm batting 
        1.000 or something.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">After the match, most of the current players and alums retired 
        to Daggett Lounge for a quiet evening of nostalgia and conversation. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think everyone had a good time at the banquet,&quot; 
        said coach Scala. &quot;It was really nice to see so many different generations 
        of Bowdoin rugby players together at one gathering. The camaraderie was 
        great, and everyone had plenty of punch and cookies.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">No one was more inspired by the Bowdoin rugby gathering 
        than junior Warren &quot;Roadkill&quot; Dubitsky. &quot;When I ate dinner 
        with all of the guys who have worked hard over the years to make this 
        team what it is, I was pretty moved,&quot; said Dubitsky proudly. &quot;All 
        I could think about was getting in better shape and lifting more weights. 
        Lifting really big weights-so big you need a license to carry them down 
        the street.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Captain Dave Kirkland '03 summed up the entire Homecoming 
        experience best: &quot;[expletive].&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The ruggers now face an impressive array of foes at this 
        year's New England championships. Although Bowdoin has never played Babson 
        (4-0-0) or the U.S. Coast Guard Academy (4-0-0), Bowdoin lost to Middlebury 
        in the Northeast championships last fall. </p>
      <p align="left">With a 5-0-0 record this season, Middlebury shows little 
        sign of weakness. Nevertheless, everyone on the team is excited simply 
        to be participating in the postseason, regardless of the outcome.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I really hope that we win at New Englands and advance,&quot; 
        said Rambo &quot;Jed Miller&quot; '03, &quot;but no matter what happens, 
        this season has been a huge success for us.&quot; </p>
