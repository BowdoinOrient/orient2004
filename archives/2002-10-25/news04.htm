      <p>Five members were inducted into the new Bowdoin College Hall of Honor

        '86, Kenneth Martin, '69, Joan Benoit Samuelson, '79, and Sidney Watson, 
        were chosen out of 120 nominees.</p>
      <p>Alumni and supporters of Bowdoin athletics attended the ceremony at a 
        brunch in Thorne dining hall. </p>

      <p>The five inaugural inductees &quot;represent the best of the best of 
        Bowdoin athletics,&quot; said Mary King '80 in her welcome address. According 
        to King, one of the goals of the ceremony was to celebrate &quot;all that 
        athletics has meant to those of us who have spent time beneath these pines.&quot;</p>
      <p>Commenting on the function of Hall of Honor, Director of Athletics Jeff 
        Ward explained, &quot;The creation of the hall helps [students] remember 
        that they are on the same team with the inductees. Their accomplishments 
        fill us with pride and raise our expectations.&quot;</p>
      <p>Sean Hanley, who presented Nelson Corey's induction, praised Corey as 
        being an &quot;intense athlete [who had] an ability to balance his intensity 
        on the playing field with humor.&quot; Once a star baseball, hockey, and 
        football player at Bowdoin, Corey came back to coach those sports as well 
        as lacrosse. Remembering his days as Bowdoin's first lacrosse coach, Corey 
        admitted, &quot;No one played the game&#133;there was one book written 
        about lacrosse, and I would read it every night like the Scripture.&quot;</p>
      <p>In her induction acceptance, Jill Isenhart praised the &quot;camaraderie 
        and chance to work together with teammates and coaches&quot; she experienced 
        in her athletic career. &quot;The foundation gained from playing sports 
        has proved more valuable than anything I gained from books and professors,&quot; 
        she added.</p>
      <p>Presenting Joan Benoit Samuelson's induction was Dana Krueger '99, who 
        told Samuelson, &quot;You are, without question, the world's finest distance 
        runner&#133;your accomplishments propelled women's running to the national 
        consciousness.&quot; Samuelson, a four-time All-American, recounted the 
        &quot;trials and tribulations of practicing with men's cross country and 
        track&quot; and training that she found &quot;challenging and fulfilling,&quot; 
        before the days of established women's sports.</p>
      <p>The final induction was Sid Watson, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. 
        Watson coached Bowdoin's hockey team from 1959 to 1983, and served as 
        athletic director from 1981 to 1998.</p>
      <p>Thanking the college in his acceptance, Watson said, &quot;I enjoyed 
        every day of getting up and coming here&#133;If I had to do it I again, 
        I wouldn't want it any other way. I have had a wonderful time [at] Bowdoin 
        College.&quot; He joked that in the course of his time at Bowdoin, &quot;some 
        of the chants [at games] have changed.&quot;</p>
      <p>Henry Burns, a member of the Hall of Honor selection committee, remarked 
        on the connections that Bowdoin athletics fosters among its athletes. 
        Burns declared that there are &quot;connections among everybody. Nels 
        Corey hired Sid Watson, who was here during Joan Benoit's time. They tell 
        a story of Bowdoin athletics together. [We are] picking individuals, but 
        honoring entire an entire spectrum of Bowdoin athletics.&quot; </p>
