      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>It took a few years, but I finally discovered why I liked Bowdoin so 
        much. For a school that has earned itself a fantastic academic reputation, 
        pretension simply has not infiltrated our campus. Without a doubt, every 
        student here is intelligent and academically successful, yet talking to 
        other students, I don't often get the feeling that they have dedicated 
        their lives to reading and studying. We make time for friends and activities 
        and we don't worry about scowling eyes judging us based on however high 
        or low we set our academic bar. It's easy and it's fun to be smart on 
        your own terms.</p>
      <p>But now, when people ask what's so great about Bowdoin, I don't know 
        what to say.</p>
      <p>I don't like raising my hand and repeating uninteresting facts to prove 
        that I've done my reading. I don't like putting my hand down because I 
        know my professor won't agree with my point of view. I have no interest 
        in scrapping for extra points in class, or forgetting my friends, or forgetting 
        my life for the sake of seeing a &quot;+&quot; in the mail in January. 
        I don't care if my 89 is indistinguishable from Frank's 80 or Louise's 
        85. I would rather spend time with Frank on Wednesday night at my house 
        than look for him in the library among the abyss of other souls in the 
        ECR. I'd rather take Louise to Portland for dinner than have her speed 
        by me on the quad, hurrying to meet with Professor Whitherspoon to &quot;just 
        prove she cares.&quot; </p>
      <p>There is no doubt in my mind that this new system has affected the essence 
        of Bowdoin College, and reading last week's editorial, I realized just 
        how little the Faculty care. Let's understand something; college is for 
        us-the students-to use as we please. Last spring, an overwhelming majority 
        of the student body screamed into the deaf ears of the college administration. 
        Somehow, we were outvoted by 45 professors who hoped to dictate our level 
        of effort. </p>
      <p>Maybe I'll start telling people that about Bowdoin. I'll say that if 
        I'd wanted a plus/minus system, I would have gone to a school that had 
        a plus/minus system. Perhaps I'll subtly imply that others, whether they 
        be students or professors, take the same advice; if they want a plus/minus 
        grading system, they ought to go somewhere where their opinions will be 
        respected, rather than imposed in a totalitarian-or at least high school-regime</p>
      <p>The grading system is ours. Give it back.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Too much ado about grading</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>These are sad days at Bowdoin College. This week, as I walked by what 
        appeared to be a mausoleum constructed of plywood, I mourned the death 
        of the glorious era where grading at Bowdoin was free of the insidious 
        plusses and minuses the faculty voted to implement at the end of last 
        semester. In the days when we were not plagued by the tyrannical plus/minus 
        system, Bowdoin was a kinder, gentler place, where having an 80 was just 
        as good as having an 89, and writing a fifteen page research paper only 
        took me ten hours as opposed to the twenty I must spend this semester. 
      </p>
      <p>If pluses and minuses had really turned students into grade-obsessed 
        saboteurs of their fellow classmates, I might share some of the outrage 
        expressed in numerous and redundant editorials appearing in The Orient 
        and on campus. However, I have not seen anyone &quot;lining up to get 
        an extra edge,&quot; and I'm tired of hearing the same complaints before 
        anyone has even received a transcript with pluses and minuses on it. I 
        am not in favor of the new system, yet it disturbs me that in a time of 
        impending war and extremely close and important political races, the most 
        notable, or at least visible student activism on our campus concerns grades. 
      </p>
      <p>The number of editorials and demonstrations regarding plus/minus tells 
        me that our priorities as a student body warrant more scrutiny than does 
        the new grading system. The latest editorial in<i> </i>the<i> Orient </i>reads, 
        &quot;the decision to change the grading system without waiting for at 
        least the Class of '03 to graduate is evidence of a self-interested choice.&quot; 
        I am curious as to how one can accuse the Faculty of acting in self-interest 
        while perceiving a decimal change in their GPA as a huge injustice. </p>
      <p>Perhaps all of this stems from (dare I say) too much self-esteem among 
        Bowdoin's student body. I fear that at Bowdoin, our pursuit of success 
        and appetite for praise has dulled our sense of duty to the common good, 
        the one that extends beyond grades. </p>
      <p>The ultimate power to shape the atmosphere at Bowdoin lies in its students, 
        not its grading system. I would urge the critics of the plus/minus system 
        to reconsider the atmosphere they are striving to create and the means 
        by which they hope to create it.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Faculty's call on grading unfair</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I agree with last week's editorial concerning the change in grading system. 
        What is most discouraging to me is not that the system has changed, but 
        that faculty seemed to give so little consideration to student opinion 
        on an issue that affects students more than anyone else. Some faculty 
        members claimed that too small a percentage of students voted in the internet 
        poll for it to be taken seriously. </p>
      <p>It is ironic that an even smaller percentage of faculty voted in the 
        first meeting on the issue. It is claimed that the new system will involve 
        improved accuracy. However, grades are neccessarily subjective, and it 
        is simply not possible to accurately distinguish student ability as precisely 
        as this system implies. The Faculty has also said that the system will 
        encourage students to work harder because they will not be able to slack 
        off, working just hard enough to secure a B. </p>
      <p>While some students did take that approach to academics in the past, 
        most Bowdoin students are obviously driven and motivated and have achieved 
        academic excellence in the past. </p>
      <p>There is no reason to assume that we need a stringent grading system 
        to motivate us, but it is quite possible that such a system will increase 
        stress and competition, thus detracting from Bowdoin's academic atmosphere. 
        Students invest a lot of time, energy, and money in this place we call 
        home for four years. (I am not implying that faculty don't invest time 
        and energy in Bowdoin College-they do). </p>
      <p>It was inconsiderate and closed-minded of the faculty to make such a 
        decision without extensive consultation with the student body. I hope 
        that in the future, issues will be discussed in a more open manner that 
        fosters exchange and considerations of various points of view. </p>
      <p>Sincerely, </p>
      <p>Lauren Poppone '03</p>
