      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are one of those die-hard Film Society fans who still 
        has the copy of our schedule that we mailed to you back at the beginning 
        of the semester, you may be scratching your head right about now. The 
        schedule says that we'll be showing <i>Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>, 
        the Coen brothers' latest film, but that film hasn't even been in theaters 
        yet. Is it possible that those film kids actually scored an exclusive 
        premiere of Joel and Ethan latest?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Well, no, actually we didn't. Last May, when we made this 
        schedule, <i>Oh Brother</i> was supposed to be in theaters over the summer 
        and available for showings in mid November. The film's release was delayed, 
        and consequently, was no longer available for public showings. This generally 
        screwed up our plans. But since the Film Society has collective reflexes 
        that make Batman jealous, we quickly made a new plan - one that will still 
        make your Saturday night great even if you don't have a date to the Jr./Sr. 
        ball.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we will be having two filmmakers from <i>National 
        Geographic Explorer</i> presenting their work on Sunday night. All films 
        will be shown both in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall and are free and open 
        to the public. </p>

        <i>Raising</i> <i>Arizona</i> (1987) <br>
        Written and Directed by</font>: <font size="2">Ethan and Joel Coen Starring: 
        Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter, John Goodman, Frances McDormand, M. Emmet 
        Walsh </font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; An ex-con played by Cage falls in love with a cop played 
        by Hunter. They get married, but learn that they are unable to have children. 
        This seems like an unavoidable problem until the Arizona family is blessed 
        with quintuplets. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; No one is really going to notice if Nic and Holly steal one, 
        are they? Well the lucky father, Nathan Arizona does, and he wants his 
        baby back. What other way to do this than hire a motorcycle riding axe-murderer? 
        Nic Cage narrates the entire film, and it's great. Everything about this 
        movie is great. Too bad the John Knapp that's off-campus this semester 
        is off-campus, as it's one of his favorite movies. You could ask him about 
        it, and he'd tell you it's one of the best comedies ever (and he'd be 
        right). Rated PG-13 </p>
      <p>Friday at 9pm <br>
        <i>Blood</i> <i>Simple</i> (1985) <br>
        Written and Directed by: <font size="2">Ethan and Joel Coen Starring: 
        John Getz, M. Emmet Walsh, Dan Hedeya, Frances McDormand </font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only film this weekend I have yet to see, so 
        I can't say much about it. The story concerns a man who hires a sleaze-ball 
        private detective to murder his cheating wife and her lover. The movie 
        takes your standard genre-the murder mystery-and completely twists it 
        around as only the Coens can do. Also, it is their first film. Rated R</p>
      <p>Saturday at 7pm <br>
        <i>The</i> <i>Big</i> <i>Lebowski</i> (1997) <br>
        Written and Directed by: <font size="2">Ethan and Joel Coen Starring: 
        Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, 
        Philip S. Hoffman, Flea, Sam Elliot, John Turturro </font><br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; OK, this film rocks. Bridges plays "the Dude," a bowler and 
        stoner who is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname-Lebowski. 
        The Dude and his bowling buddies Goodman (as a psycho veteran) and Buscemi 
        (who is always great) get mixed up in kidnappings, the porn industry, 
        auto theft, rug purchasing, and a group of nihilists. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in this film does a top notch job (especially Turturro, 
        who portrays perhaps the greatest fictitious bowler in recorded history), 
        and the script, soundtrack and camerawork match this level. All-around, 
        it is a great film. You don't want to miss it Rated R</p>
      <p>Saturday at 9pm <br>
        <i>Fargo</i> (1996) <br>
        Written and Directed by: <font size="2">Ethan and Joel Coen Starring: 
        William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This film, arguably the brothers' greatest, is an extra-dark 
        comedy. It is about a car salesman who hires two thugs (punks, if you 
        will) to kidnap his wife so he can collect a large amount of money from 
        her rich father. Policewoman Margie (McDormand's Oscar winning role) is 
        assigned to the case, and she travels across the snow covered lands of 
        North Dakota and Minnesota trying to solve the case. It may be a slightly 
        disturbing film, but it is amazing to watch. Too bad my buddy Johnny Yost 
        is studying away this year, as this is his favorite film. You could ask 
        him about it, and he'd tell you it's one of the best movies ever (and 
        he'd be right). Rated R</font></p>
      <p>Sunday at 8pm<br>
        <i>National Geographic</i> Filmmakers Mick Davie and Sean Fine Davie and 
        Fine will join us for an evening of their films, each of which has been 
        shown on <i>National Geographic Explorer</i>. Mick's films are <i>From 
        Cape Town to Cairo</i>, a documentary about a 7-month trip between the 
        two cities he made by any means necessary. He also made <i>War Child</i>, 
        a film about the refugee crisis in Albania and Kosovo. Fine's film is 
        entitled <i>The Pigeon Murders</i>. Both filmmakers will be present at 
        the screenings and will take part in a Q&A session afterwards. </p>
