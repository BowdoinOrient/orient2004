      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When most Bowdoin students think of a chamber choir, they 
        probably picture a sedate group of singers in orderly rows, chanting something 
        in Latin. Most people probably don't picture a small horde of musicians 
        storming into the Chapel performing a dance mildly resembling the Funky 
        Chicken, voices raised to the beat of West African drumming. As it turns 
        out, the Bowdoin Chamber Choir is both serene and wild in performance, 
        a delicious paradox that comes from its unique and offbeat approach to 
        music.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Originally begun when the College became coed, the Chamber 
        Choir has been under the direction of Robby Greenlee since 1983. Since 
        then, the group has developed a reputation for performing an incredibly 
        diverse selection of pieces, from renaissance masses to Puerto Rican, 
        Acadian, and Irish folk music to modern South African compositions. This 
        broadening of the Choir's repertoire is due entirely to Greenlee, known 
        affectionately to his students as Robby. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A musically rich background has contributed significantly 
        to Robby's choice of varied pieces. As a singer, pianist, and organist, 
        he has performed in orchestral groups and, in addition, composes original 
        music. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In choosing students to perform in the group, Robby says he 
        looks for "many different vocal colors," and that "once the choir is assembled, 
        I try to find the best sound it can achieve as a unit." On choosing pieces 
        to perform, his approach is remarkably democratic. The choir has a great 
        deal of input on which works they perform, and often make suggestions 
        early on in the year regarding pieces they would like to work on. Says 
        Robby, "I look for what the group can best do…I'm always looking for new 
        things."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The choir itself even reflects this method of drawing from 
        myriad resources to create a diverse musical unit, on and off the risers. 
        Choir members come from all different musical backgrounds, and many are 
        involved in one or more musical groups on campus outside of Chamber Choir. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that does unify the group's members, however, is 
        their admiration of Robby as a director. Says Brian Ryu '01, "One of the 
        reasons singing in Chamber Choir is so enjoyable is the fact that Robby 
        Greenlee is the director…I just can't get enough of what he has to say 
        and share musically, especially his creatively intense analogies." Robby's 
        impact as a director is evident even in newer choir members; Colin Dieck 
        '04 says "Working with Robby is great. This is my first semester and already 
        I've learned so much I never knew about my voice."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This sense of admiration has only grown for the seniors in 
        the group. Chris Stearns '01, choir assistant and four-year member of 
        the group, remembers that he came to Bowdoin "to sing with Robby." "He's 
        just such a talented, versatile musician. My voice has improved a thousand 
        fold since I began singing with him. He should be in a conservatory; Bowdoin's 
        lucky to have him."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Another perk to participation in Choir is the highly anticipated 
        biannual tour abroad. The group has sung in Europe three times, including 
        Ireland last year, Puerto Rico, and South America. One fond memory Robby 
        has of singing abroad is the response it produces in the people of that 
        country.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He notes that when the group members went to Ecuador, they 
        would often sing on the street. When they began to sing Ecuadorian folk 
        songs, people would stop and join in on the impromptu performances. Experiences 
        such as these were also part of the Ireland tour, which made the experience 
        even more vibrant. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, one of the most rewarding aspects of participating 
        in Choir is performing for the Bowdoin community. This Saturday's concert 
        promises to be an intense musical experience, complete with pieces by 
        the World Music Ensemble, a new group that performs different types of 
        percussion-based music. Among works being performed are several African 
        drumming tunes, "If ye love me" by Tallis, a Ladysmith Black Mambazo piece, 
        and even a selection from James Taylor. While most tickets for the 7:30 
        p.m. concert have already been snapped up by community members, there 
        is a chance that some will still be available at the Smith Union info 
        desk. Some students are already anticipating the high-energy performance; 
        says Meredith Hoar '03, "Chamber Choir always puts on a great show. I 
        like the eclectic mix, especially the folk songs." The Choir is also in 
        the process of recording a new CD drawing from the past four years of 
        songs, so that soon everyone will be able to, as Robby says, "hear people 
        from different backgrounds get together and make something beautiful as 
        a unit." </p>
