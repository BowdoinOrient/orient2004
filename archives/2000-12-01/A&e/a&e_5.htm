      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" --> 
      <p>Much to my chagrin, both copies of the latest Hulk Hogan feature-length 
        film were on loan at Video Galaxy, as well as Women's <i>Penitentiary</i> 
        <i>6</i>. I hope that this week's film, <i>The</i> <i>Peacekeeper</i> 
        starring Dolph Lundgren (<i>The</i> <i>Punisher</i>, <i>Universal</i> 
        <i>Soldier</i>), is a worthy substitute. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When I got the movie home, I noticed that the actual video 
        cassette had been released by Dreamworks and that its running time was 
        204 minutes. Immediately, I knew something was wrong. I popped the cassette 
        into my VCR. To my horror, the movie that played on the television screen 
        starred George Clooney and was called <i>The</i> <i>Peacemaker</i>. I 
        grabbed the tape and stormed into Video Galaxy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I approached a shaggy-haired clerk and announced, "I rented 
        a movie called <i>The</i> <i>Peacemaker</i> starring George Clooney, but 
        what I wanted was <i>The</i> <i>Peacekeeper</i> starring - "The shaggy-haired 
        gentleman cut me off and said "Dolph Lundgren."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He was proud to have anticipated this detail. I was impressed 
        by his knowledge. He looked at me with smug assurance, "Common mistake." 
        Indeed. Obviously I am not the first Dolph Lundgren fan to come home with 
        a movie starring that namby-pamby George Clooney.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Not only does <i>The</i> <i>Peacekeeper</i> feature the esteemed 
        Mr. Lundgren, but also stars Roy Scheider ("Smile you son of a bitch!") 
        as a nameless President of the United States (Mr. President to you and 
        me, and even his closest friends), and none other than Montel Williams. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Dolph and Montel become close friends, as they dodge terrorist 
        machine gun fire together and exchange witty remarks: "How do we get out 
        of here?" "That way." Not since Gibson and Glover has a white guy/ black 
        guy duo been so charming.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; You want plot? Here's your damned fancy-pants plot: Dolph 
        Lundgren is Lt. Frank Cross who is famous for ditching his military duties 
        to pilot cargo loads of rice to starving Kurds. His punishment for making 
        these altruistic but costly deliveries against orders is either a court 
        marshal or a new assignment with the government. Cross chooses the latter. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;His new task is to carry the "black bag," a hi-tech brief-case/ 
        computer which contains the launch codes for our nuclear arsenal. Lt. 
        Cross's job is to follow Mr. President around, protecting the "black bag" 
        with his life. Well, wouldn't you know it, but a bunch of terrorists steal 
        it from him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;But Dolph doesn't give it up too easily. In one of the most 
        ridiculous car chases ever captured on film, Dolph speeds after the terrorists 
        from the roof of a parking garage, hopping from one building to the next, 
        rooftop to rooftop. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Soon enough, Dolph makes his way into a highly secured government 
        nuclear missile silo where the terrorist group has killed every officer 
        but one: Montel Williams! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Montel and Dolph team up and kick some terrorist rump. But 
        they can't act fast enough, as the terrorist leader launches the first 
        missile and destroys. . . Mt. Rushmore. Hmm, oh well. I think I could 
        live without that. Oh right, I guess some people live in South Dakota, 
        but we won't trouble ourselves too much over that detail.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Montel gets shot in the leg quicker than he 
        can say, "Are you raising a Teenage Monster?" so he doesn't play much 
        of a crucial role. Dolph is faced with a knife-wielding terrorist lackey 
        who asks, "You wanna die dick-wad?" Dolph kills him with an axe. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;No one calls Dolph Lundgren a dick-wad and lives to tell about 
        it. No one.The gripping climax puts President Roy into a bit of a pickle. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist leader demands that Mr. President either shoot 
        himself in the head on live national television, or he'll blow up Washington 
        D.C. What do you do, Mr. President? What do you do? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Well I won't tell you what he does, because you'd be best 
        off finding out for yourself. What I will tell you, is that when Montel 
        is asked by a reporter in the wake of the disaster, "Who was responsible 
        for what happened?" he can only answer with one word: "Einstein." B+ </p>
