      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this interview was to portray the band Dispatch 
        as people, not as enigmas. Therefore, instead of asking hard-hitting questions 
        about the music, we decided to let the conversation ramble. And ramble 
        it did:</p>
      <p><b>Orient</b>: If you could interview yourselves, what would you ask?<br>
        <b>Pete</b> <b>Heimbold</b>: That gets dangerous. <br>
        <b>Brad Corrigan</b>: We'd just start talking about cotton balls and . 
        . . how often do you deal with the color pink in your life and what does 
        that do to you psychologically . . . heretically . . . apathetically? 
        <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: But what do you think? 'Cause otherwise we'll just ramble. 
        <br>
        <b>Chad</b> <b>Urmston</b>: Yeah, we're dorks. We're power dorks. <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: We wouldn't say anything about the music. We probably wouldn't 
        say anything. <br>
        <b>Brad</b>: A Nicolas Cage-type interview. Orient (intelligently): Well 
        . . . I guess that would be bad. <br>
        <b>Chad</b>: Nicolas Cage? Brad: Yeah, John Cage's brother. <br>
        <b>Pete</b> (taking over the interview): So, guys . . . Tell me a little 
        bit about the music. I've heard a lot of different things. How would you 
        describe yourselves? <br>
        <b>Chad</b>: Tribal skank. <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: Wow. <br>
        <b>Orient</b>: Oh, that's good. <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: I sense you're definitely a band with a bit of an identity 
        complex and a mediocrity complex. <br>
        <b>Chad</b>: I'd call it more of a crisis. <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: Crisis . . . <br>
        <b>Orient</b>: Why is that? <br>
        <b>Chad</b>: Oh, just because we deal with things in manianical, like, 
        visions. <br>
        <b>Pete</b> (thoughtfully): Really. <br>
        <b>Orient</b> (encouragingly): That's not necessarily a bad thing. <br>
        <b>Brad</b>: They're gonna be, like, looking through the dictionary - 
        what's manianical, dude? (laughs) It's not here in Webster's! <br>
        <b>Pete</b>: Chad's a wordsmith. <br>
        <b>Orient</b>: That's good to hear. Welcome to the school.<br>
        <br>
        (Laughter on all sides. At this point the interview becomes a bit incoherent, 
        lots of rambling, etc.) <br>
        <br>
        Five minutes later, after discussing the song "The General" for some time 
        . . .<br>
        <br>
        <b>Brad</b>: We're kind of glad that that's one of our . . . that people 
        have connected as much as they have to that song. If there is an anthem 
        that we really feel good about in its message and how funky we play it 
        and how people jump with us and react to it, "The General " is one that 
        we still have a lot of fun with. <b><br>
        Pete</b>: But, I don't think that it's as much about the message as it 
        is about energy in the show. I mean, people can interpret the lyrics any 
        way they want. For me that doesn't concern me as much. For me, what concerns 
        me is the energy that comes from the music. Lyrics can go all different 
        places with people, you know? And I think that's what we've been trying 
        to develop through the live performance. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: So if you have an apathetic crowd, does that make it a bad 
        show for you? <b><br>
        Brad</b>: We walk away feeling like, what happened? It's totally our fault. 
        Orient: What do you guys think of MTV? <b><br>
        Pete</b>: It's pretty terrible. <b><br>
        Chad</b>: MTV2 is okay. Brad: It's so money-based. I don't feel like there's 
        any soul. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: I don't really think there is. <b><br>
        Brad</b>: Remember when you used to watch it because you were so addicted 
        and interested in it. You know, it was new and edgy and you'd be exposed 
        to something that - <b><br>
        Pete</b>: And money controls that. There isn't any good music, no good 
        songs or good films. <b><br>
        Brad</b>: And those stupid shows! <b><br>
        Pete</b>: How many . . . Limp Bizkit, Korn, Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Britney 
        . . . If I ever flick through it, that's all I see. Where are the bands, 
        you know? <b><br>
        Orient</b>: Did you ever watch it, did you kind of grow up with MTV when 
        it was more quality or -? <b><br>
        Brad</b>: I remember I wasn't ever allowed to watch it as a kid, so I'm 
        sure that's half of it. Whenever I was at my grandparents' house and they 
        would leave the room, I would go right to it. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: I never had cable as a child. I was the same way.<br>
        <b>Brad</b>: But still, it was the feeling of being exposed to all of 
        the best music and seeing it visually - what an amazing thing! <b><br>
        Chad</b>: The Black Crowes used to be on it when we were in high school. 
        <b><br>
        Brad</b>: But now I would never watch MTV expecting to find a new band. 
        That's part of the problem. I don't know if we would really like to be 
        on MTV, even if they gave us that opportunity. It just discredits you 
        somehow, being associated with it. <b><br>
        Orient</b>: So what do you think the best way to get a new audience is? 
        <b><br>
        Brad</b>: Napster. MP3s. Touring and Napster.We have fans wherever we 
        go now because people have access to our music. <br>
        <br>
        ~Due to the fact that certain band members and Orient staffers like to 
        wax philosophical about album art and the effect of warfare on the psyche, 
        the interview ran a little long.* Can you blame us? The members of Dispatch 
        were interesting, friendly and funny. The concert was fabulous and fun, 
        and whether or not MTV acknowledges it, their incredible skill and dynamic 
        relationship (they could not only play each other's instruments, they 
        were also all amazing singers!) has and will earn them much respect and 
        acclaim in the music world. And we can't think of a band that deserves 
        it more. They also wish to inform anyone who "plays live" to contact Jack 
        Gauthier of Lakewest Recording at lakewestrecording.com. Be sure to check 
        out Dispatch's website at www.dispatchmusic.com. <br>
