      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This Sunday Bowdoin will enjoy a private showing from two 
        of the foremost creators of documentaries in America today. Mick Davie 
        and Sean Fine create films for National Geographic, and they will introduce 
        a showing of three of their movies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Starting at 8:00 p.m. Davie and Fine will give a brief introduction 
        of the three movies. Davie will introduce the two movies he produced, 
        entitled <i>From Capetown to Cairo</i> and <i>War</i> <i>Child</i>. Fine 
        will speak a few words on his film <i>Pigeon</i> <i>Murders</i>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Davie made From Capetown to Cairo when he was only 22, and 
        it is an account of his seven-month journey from South Africa to Egypt, 
        by any means possible. He covers many different areas and topics, starting 
        with police violence in Johannesburg. He then documents conditions among 
        street children in Zimbabwe, detailing their dreams for their country 
        as well as themselves. He also treats the issue of land mine deaths among 
        the people of Mozambique.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Davie first got his job at National Geographic from this 
        film. He first showed it on Australian television, where National Geographic 
        found it and decided to buy the film and hire its producer. He also produced 
        War Child, an account of the status of the innumerable refugees in Albania 
        and Kosovo. What makes both of these documentaries fascinating and incredibly 
        moving is their first person perspective. This gives the viewer the sensation 
        that s/he is actually there, and conveys an immediate sense of what it 
        means to be a refugee in Albania, or someone in Mozambique who lives in 
        fear of his/her every step. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Davie still works for National Geographic, and some of his 
        current projects include a film dealing with Pakistani honor killings, 
        and he returns to a theme in <i>From Capetown to Cairo</i> in making a 
        movie about post-apartheid South Africa. He has a prominent place at National 
        Geographic, which earned him a place in a <i>National Geographic Explorer</i> 
        episode, opposite National Geographic notable Dr. Robert Ballard, titled 
        "The New Explorers."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The episode was an examination of the few areas of nature 
        left to be explored, since virtually the entire globe has been discovered. 
        In addition to other answers, such as the bottom of the world's oceans, 
        was the area in which Davie specializes, namely cultural investigations 
        and expeditions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Accompanying Davie is Fine, a talented filmmaker and producer 
        in his own right. Fine, after having finished <i>The Pigeon Murders</i> 
        (which he is introducing), continued making films with National Geographic. 
        He is currently working in collaboration with Davie on a piece called 
        <i>Frontline</i> <i>Diaries</i>, which, judging from both their past work, 
        promises to be quite good.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Both men, in addition to showing their films on National Geographic, 
        have shown them on other television stations, such as the Australian release 
        of <i>From Capetown to Cairo</i>, but their movies have also been shown 
        in America on other channels, such as CNBC.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After the introductions and the films, each producer will 
        hold a question-and- answer period. The questions will obviously deal 
        with the films just shown, but the audience is free to ask any questions 
        about their past work, their current projects, or even filmmaking in general, 
        such as how one gets into the business.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The movies themselves are not incredibly long. The entire 
        event, from introduction to question and answer, should take more than 
        two hours. The showing is free to all members of the Bowdoin community,
