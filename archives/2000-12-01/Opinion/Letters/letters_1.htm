      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We were disappointed and frustrated to read the editorial 
        in the last issue of the Orient regarding the upcoming Junior/Senior Ball. 
        The author argued that by making the dance a "swing" event, it aimed to 
        exclude those members of the Junior and Senior classes who cannot dance 
        swing or who do not enjoy this style of music.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that those who selected the music were aware 
        of this sentiment, and they worked to find a band that departed from the 
        swing genre, but which would still maintain an atmosphere of panache. 
        The organizers of the Junior/Senior Ball who chose this band did so after 
        listening to dozens of tapes of performers and elected this band because 
        they felt that their sound was unique from the typical "swing" style.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We appreciate the suggestion made by the writer to mix the 
        music up, perhaps by inviting other bands, but the reality is that, due 
        to budget constraints, the classes do not have the means by which to fund 
        more than just one group. With a higher ticket price we would have been 
        able to provide more variety. However, in an effort to be sure that the 
        dance is not "exclusive," we chose to keep the ticket price down to $5, 
        a portion of which, we should add, will go to support a local family for 
        the holidays. With a low ticket price, our hope is that less people will 
        be deterred from joining us in what will be a joyful occasion as this 
        semester nears completion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The quickness to judge the dance as being too exclusive is 
        unjustified for those who donated their time to organize the ball. As 
        class officers, we always encourage your input in the planning of activities, 
        and we hope that in the future you may suggest changes before the details 
        have been set, rather than raise objections after the event has been organized.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely, <br>
