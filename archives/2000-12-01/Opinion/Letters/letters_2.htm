      <p>To the Editors: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing in response to the article "NASCAR: the Scent 
        of America" in the last issue of the Orient. This article covered an entire 
        page of the Sports section, and I am questioning why it received so much 
        recognition.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I find it disappointing that we as college students, who are 
        taught to open our minds and see things in different perspectives, could 
        have such a minute sense of reality of the life outside this Bowdoin Bubble. 
        I find it respectful and honorable when there are people who want to expand 
        their minds, and experience something new, such as a sports event like 
        NASCAR. The article begins describing the event, but eventually focuses 
        only on the people at the event. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, to generalize all individuals at a sporting 
        event is not only ignorant, but completely close-minded. The attitude 
        portrayed in this article is simply pompous and lacks an openness to break 
        down these social barriers that we often put up. It is merely to mock, 
        ridicule, and look down at a group of people that may enjoy a spectator 
        sport that another may not necessarily take part in. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Why does this article have to assume that people who attend 
        this sort of event all act the same way, and have the same mannerisms 
        and ways of life? It is this sort of article, this sort of ignorant predisposition 
        that separates and divides our society today. To say that people at this 
        event can be generalized to "communicate in a series of monkey grunts 
        and whistles," and "collect recyclabes around the campsite" is thoughtless 
        and arrogant. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I feel this article implies that there is a deeply-rooted 
        sense of hierarchy we hold in our society, and that we as college students 
        are higher than these individuals. The end of the article may have been 
        a joke, but to suggest that the students actually digressed from their 
        normal way of life, to become unhygienic and non-verbal does imply this. 
        This article implies negative perceptions and an overall disrespect for 
        others in our society. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We received this privilege to attend Bowdoin to expand our 
        minds, and see these types of labels as a barrier and a hindrance to developing 
        our society. Aren't we taught to overcome them and change them, not to 
        reinforce and support them?</p>
