      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" --> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to tell you about a friend of mine. Her name is 
        Green Squall, but you might also know her by her given name, Alice Turcotte. 
        She and Pat Grover are the switchboard operators here, and you probably 
        see them every day. If you live in the Tower like I do, you probably see 
        them two or three or forty-seven times a day, actually (and anyone who 
        knows Alice knows that even one meeting with her can seem like forty-seven! 
        Har har, Alice!) On those days when she's not caterwauling at me, I like 
        to stop and talk to Alice, listening to her spin a yarn about some juicy 
        piece of Bowdoin gossip, or listening to her yell at me for some perceived 
        indiscretion that I have visited upon her. Sometimes, she even calls and 
        leaves obnoxious voicemails on my machine, telling me to "come down and 
        see the old bag in the booth." She just asked my roommate Chris if he 
        had been smoking "wacky tobacc-y." Yeah, that Alice. She sure is something.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I lived on the ninth floor of the Tower, and I 
        was lucky enough to have Kirk as my "Housekeeper." I put that word in 
        quotes because "Housekeeper" does not even begin to scratch the surface 
        of what Kirk and his colleagues do around here. Remember the time last 
        year when one of the Tower elevators had a pile of chicken bones in it? 
        Or the time that a friend of mine was waiting downstairs for the elevator 
        and, when the door opened, she was surprised to find the lone occupant 
        urinating in a corner? You do? Well, someone has to clean that up, and 
        a job like that does not qualify as "Housekeeping" to me. It qualifies 
        as "cleaning up some freak's disgusting mess." But the thing is that Kirk 
        would always bend over backwards for us, helping us out with furniture, 
        or giving us a little slack about always removing our belongings from 
        our bathroom. I know that, even though there are dust buffalo under my 
        bed, I can always be assured that our bathrooms, elevators, lobby, and 
        laundry room will be kept clean by someone other than me. How often does 
        that happen, and how often do we take it for granted?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Too often, I say, and I include myself in this implication. 
        We are lucky here because, in addition to receiving a top-notch liberal 
        arts education, we also have people like Alice to answer our phones, Kirk 
        to clean up for us, Debbie and Patty to run Moulton and Thorne, and so 
        many other staff members who do much more than their meager salaries would 
        indicate. It is disturbing to think what Bowdoin College would be like-and 
        how different our experiences would be-if not for the work of these staff 
        members and countless others like them. I know I'm generalizing, but it 
        would take up the entire allotted space of my column if I were to name 
        every behind-the-scenes staffer and the work that he or she does. There 
        are just so many, I wouldn't know where to start.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;So the next time you go into the dining hall, or see your 
        dorm's "Housekeeper" vacuuming in the hallway, or walk past the switchboard, 
        give a wave. Stop walking and say "hi." Tell the staff how much you appreciate 
        what they do. Because if you don't, Alice will come and get you, and that, 
        my dear readers, would be a most frightening fate. </p>
