      <p>When dealing with the issue of diversity at Bowdoin, it seems to be very 
        much a black/white issue. I don't want to be misunderstood as saying that 
        diversity at Bowdoin pertains solely to one minority group. I would merely 
        like to point out that this college's commitment to ethnic cultivation 
        and diversity is not evenly distributed. Although there is a significant 
        Asian constituency in the student body, the Administration does not heed 
        the economic, academic, and psychological needs of its Asian students. 
        Perhaps Asians do not provide the "diversity" to raise Bowdoin's standings 
        in the U.S. News & World Report. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As a Korean-American student and a senior, it has become an 
        undeniable reality that the Administration does not feel the need to cater 
        to Asians as a minority group. The primary focus of the College is to 
        publicly extend opportunities to the African-American population and, 
        to a lesser extent, the Latino population. Any such attempts for Asian 
        students, however, are meekly pursued and are, at best, temporary. There 
        is a severe shortage of Asian professors and mentors on campus, in addition 
        to extremely limited funding for the development of the Asian Studies 
        department, an increasingly popular major and demand. Also, the Administration 
        does not provide an admissions scholarship for Asian prospectives.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a clear-cut reason for this phenomenon. One can 
        always point blame to the Administration, the executor of academic and 
        financial decisions. But in all reality, it is much more complex. It is 
        not the fault of the Administration, because the Administration gets funding 
        from the Trustees. But there are no Asians sitting on the Board of Trustees, 
        so it is difficult to have a source of influence. Is this our own fault 
        for graduating from this institution and not contributing back to it? 
        Or is it the fault of the institution for failing to provide the nurturing 
        environment that would encourage its Asian students to give back? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple answer, for issues are never "black & white." 
        I do not write to present an answer, but simply to raise some eyebrows 
        and awareness. If the College is truly committed to diversity, it should 
        focus on celebrating it, not merely attaining it in numbers and statistics.
