      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As you read this, there are technically twelve days remaining 
        in this semester during which either a class or a final will take place. 
        Also note that as you read this article, the holiday season abounds-music, 
        lights, and all. That having been said, I've compiled a list of what could 
        appropriately be called the Twelve Days of Finals. It's fitting enough, 
        seeing as that's the only tune we Bowdoin students will be dancing to 
        until the end of the semester <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If you will: the top twelve reasons the end of the semester 
        sucks/ rocks(?)-you decide for yourself.</p>
      <p><b>12</b>) Twelve days. The amount of work due is enough to last months. 
        Enough said. <br>
        <b>11</b>) If the person next door plays Jingle Bells one more time while 
        you are trying to figure out a thesis, you'll strangle them. <br>
        <b>10</b>) Unused polar points = convenience store fun. Can we say Dominoes? 
        <br>
        <b>9</b>) Meeting with professors-yeah, you and everyone else in the world. 
        Good luck getting an appointment in a timely fashion just when your thesis 
        needs revamping. (We won't mention the fact that the thesis should have 
        been written well before Thanksgiving.) <br>
        <b>8</b>) The week before reading period: by the time you get to reading 
        period, you will feel as though you don't even need it, as you can't imagine 
        you should have to do any more work than you did in the previous seven 
        days. <br>
        <b>7</b>) Speaking of reading period, a high-five to the first night without 
        classes. A final chance to let your hair down, run down the stored up 
        goods, and chill for the last time this semester. Here's to the second 
        night of reading period, in case you missed or didn't quite get enough 
        of the first. <br>
        <b>6</b>) The nerd bell at the library during finals: It's kind of fun 
        to sit and watch just how many people come scurrying out of the library, 
        from every corner imaginable, fully intending to stay up all night, faces 
        stressed, and bags weighed down. Yes, only the procrastinators amongst 
        us have an opportunity to really enjoy this adventure. <br>
        <b>5</b>) Golden rings…. <br>
        <b>4</b>) If you hear people say that they have "soooo much work" one 
        more time, they too will be strangled along with your jingle-bell floor 
        mate. <br>
        <b>3</b>) Watching the stress levels rise on campus: People suddenly become 
        the Grinch. Holiday spirit? What 8$#@ holiday?!? <br>
        <b>2</b>) Caffeine, caffeine, sugar, coffee, caffeine, coke, caffeine, 
        candy….did I mention caffeine? <br>
        <b>1</b>). . . . . . . . . One hour of sleep. . . . . . . . . . .</p>
