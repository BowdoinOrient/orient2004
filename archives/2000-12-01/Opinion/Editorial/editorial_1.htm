      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Bowdoin student, past and present, has signed the Academic 
        Honor Code. As stated in the College Catalogue, "The Academic Honor Code 
        plays a central role in the intellectual life at Bowdoin College. Students 
        and faculty are obligated to ensure its success. Uncomprimised intellectual 
        inquiry lies at the heart of a liberal arts education." In signing the 
        Honor Code, students agree to make every effort to ensure the practice 
        of "uncompromised intellectual inquiry."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;However, towards the end of each fall semester, many professors 
        manipulate the final exam schedule so that students have little time for 
        sleeping, eating, and showering, let alone engaging in "intellectual inquiry." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;When professors demand that finals be completed before the 
        official date assigned by the Office of Student Records, finals examinations 
        and papers are less a measure of the quality of a student's intellect, 
        and more a measure of how much work a student can accomplish in the shortest 
        period of time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The Office of Student Records attempts to schedule final examinations 
        so that a student's work load is dispersed throughout the six-day finals 
        period. While it may be unpleasant for professors to remain on campus 
        so late into the holiday season, it is equally unpleasant for students 
        when, due to a lack of time rather than a lack of ability, they are not 
        given the opportunity to accurately demonstrate their abilities. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The College Catalog states: "Final examinations of the College 
        are held at the close of each semester and must be given according to 
        the schedule published by the Office of Student Records." Faculty have 
        voted on and approved this policy and yet, so many professors violate 
        this rule. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While some professors explicitly violate the policy by demanding 
        students complete their finals before the date published by the Office 
        of Student Records, other professors more subtly violate the policy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In many classes, professors assign the last paper or test 
        of the term to be given while classes are still in session. In a syntactically 
        tricky move, assignments are referred to as the "last paper" or the "last 
        test" of the semester, rather than a "final." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of the label, the last assignment of the semester, 
        by any other name, is still a "final." When professors assign final examinations 
        and papers to take place during the last week of classes, students must 
        begin preparing well before reading period. Thus, "intellectual inquiry" 
        is undoubtedly compromised, as students are too busy completing their 
        "finals" to fully participate in the last few weeks of classes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Some professors argue that, in order to submit final grades 
        on time, they need to have all exams and papers completed before the final 
        examination date determined by the Office of Student Records. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;However, if a professor has concerns regarding timely submission 
        of final grades, such concerns should be voiced at faculty meetings prior 
        to the publication of the official finals schedule. If members of the 
        faculty feel they are not given ample time to submit final grades, professors 
        must work with the Administration to resolve the problem. To indirectly 
        deal with the problem through the manipulation of the finals schedule 
        is unfair to students, and most certainly compromises the practice of 
        "intellectual inquiry." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Many students are hesitant to challenge the authority of a 
        professor, so the gross manipulation of the finals schedule is an abuse 
        of professorial power that goes unnoticed by the Administration. We all 
        know students foot the bill, but now they also pay the price. </p>
