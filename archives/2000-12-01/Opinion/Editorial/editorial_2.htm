      <p>During the last several weeks Bowdoin students completed the semi-annual 
        ritual of selecting classes from the cornucopia of interesting-nay, intriguing-classes 
        offered by our esteemed college; each student fulfilling his or her academic 
        ambitions within the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, or…<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wait, turns out that successfully registering for introductory 
        classes, particularly within the social sciences, is about as likely as 
        finding your future husband or wife at Bowdoin: everyone says it happens, 
        and there are stats to back it up, but no one personally sees any evidence.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;A few representative stories: a sophomore who has unsuccessfully 
        attempted to register for Anthropology 101 for four consecutive semesters, 
        a senior who needs Sociology 101 to fulfill the sociology major but has 
        been denied admission by the instructor, a senior who needs a social science 
        class to meet a distribution requirement but was denied entry to Anthropology 
        101, Sociology 101, Psychology 101a, Psychology 101b, and Government 120.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin prides itself on the variety its liberal arts curriculum 
        provides. Yet, while an abundance of fruity seminars is well and good, 
        these savory intellectual treats are only available for students who fulfill 
        the required introductory classes. And with too few sections of these 
        introductory courses offered to meet ever-swelling demands, it is difficult 
        to see how Bowdoin can still sell its admittedly diverse and compelling-but 
        inaccessible-curriculum as a chief attribute of the school. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While it's not particularly glamorous to offer more sections 
        of introductory social sciences, Bowdoin's course catalog should be accessible 
        first, diverse second. And if Bowdoin cannot satisfactorily reconcile 
        curricular access and diversity with its current faculty resources then 
        it must hire more professors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Although Professor X has been a real martyr this year, as 
        always displaying an amazing cross-disciplinary aptitude, perhaps it's 
        time to relieve some of X's workload by hiring a few more tenure-track 
        professors. Denial doesn't seem an appropriate solution, but then again 
        we haven't been able to take Psychology 101, so we could be mistaken.
