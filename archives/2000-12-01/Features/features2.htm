      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time was passing so quickly, it felt like I'd already 
        been in America six months, though in reality it was only three.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homecoming weekend had come and gone, along with my 
        first blind date, followed by Thanksgiving, spent with my friend Simon 
        from the boat and his family in Philadelphia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing about Homecoming had been the Big Game. 
        I forget whom our side played-whether Colby or Bates, Amherst or Williams-or 
        if Bowdoin won. But if we did, I'm sure it was my roommate Harvey who 
        scored the winning touchdown or kick. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I really understood football, a rougher form 
        of rugby it seemed, but fortunately my date did, patiently explaining 
        the finer points to me. We had been "matched up" after lunch on the day 
        of the Big Game in First Parish Church, where Commencements and Convocations 
        were held. The girls sat on one side of the aisle and the boys on the 
        other, with the sexes separated just as in an orthodox synagogue. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last name beginning with R, it took a long time for 
        it to be called, and I was beginning to wonder if there'd be any girls 
        left. The one I was matched up with, though no Marilyn Monroe, was awfully 
        nice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before the game started, all eyes were on a couple 
        walking past the stands to their seats: a glamorous woman in a fur coat, 
        on the arm of a ruggedly handsome man in suit and hat, worn at a jaunty 
        angle a la Humphrey Bogart. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a B-movie actor, and Bowdoin alumnus, called 
        Gary Merrill, my date said, with his wife, Bette Davies, the famous Hollywood 
        star. I hadn't heard of either before. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Gimme a B...gimme an O," pretty cheerleaders chanted, 
        kicking shapely legs high, throwing batons high in the air, and deftly 
        catching them as they came down. Frankly, I enjoyed all the attendant 
        razzmatazz more than the actual game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the house party afterwards, there was dancing in 
        the lounge, to a live band whose bandleader cracked jokes. There was also 
        a great deal of drinking in the basement meeting room, for once stripped 
        of its bogus fraternal mystique, having been converted to a make-shift 
        bar. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, as the lights were dimmed in the lounge and 
        couples started "making out," kind, yet determined-looking chaperones 
        took up positions at the foot of the stairs, making sure no one took their 
        date, blind or not, but by chance blind-drunk, up to their room. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Limy, did you get laid?" Big Charlie cheerily 
        asked the next day. Fat chance. All my date and I did was hold hands. 
        A beanpole of a girl, taller than me. Unfortunately I've forgotten her 
        name. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how could I forget my second blind date, for Ivies 
        weekend-to fast-forward the action again.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonnie was her name. It sounded almost like Bunny to 
        me, the way she pronounced it. A shortish girl, from Newark, New Jersey, 
        but a little sex-bomb. Bonnie, arriving hours late, had planned to fly 
        up to Maine she explained, but due to bad weather her flight had been 
        canceled. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So her dad had "jumped in the car" and driven her all 
        the way to Brunswick. Naturally, by the time she finally turned up, I 
        was more or less "stinko," as Charlie put it. However, we made up for 
        time missed by more drinking, and wild petting, the former leaving me 
        with a splitting headache, the latter with lipstick all over my clean 
        white shirt, and in the end, I felt more frustrated than ever. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure I didn't actually prefer Miss Beanpole. 
        In answer to the same question Charlie had asked me, Harvey defiantly 
        said, "Damn near," as though talking about a daring tackle or a run nearly 
        resulting in a goal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These revels were followed by the more cerebral excitement 
        of the '54 mid-term elections, as described in a previous installment, 
        and a couple of weeks later, by the Thanksgiving Holiday-my first break 
        from college.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family, having invited me to spend this uniquely 
        American feast with them, happened to be Jewish. In fact, Simon was a 
        second-generation American, yet the family was already as American as 
        roast turkey with cranberry sauce, corn-on-the-cob, and pumpkin pie. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Tsarist Russia, Simon's father had started life 
        in America as a dishwasher in the Ghetto of the Lower East Side. The proverbial 
        self-made man, he had worked his way up to being boss of his own business, 
        an outdoor advertising agency in Philadelphia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sister in New York, though not quite a self-made 
        woman, had done alright for herself, too, by marrying a Wall Street broker-a 
        Gentile, she said. At first, I never thought of Simon-or my Bowdoin friends 
        Zal and Ed-as Jews either, simply because, having grown up in Hitler's 
        Germany, I'd never met anyone Jewish before. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon's family lived in Drexel Hill, a pleasant residential 
        area on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Set on a slight rise, a long flight 
        of steps led up to the house, outside of which his mother stood waiting 
        for us as our taxi pulled up. Simon bounded up the steps to be greeted 
        with a kiss and a hug, while I hung back a little, suddenly feeling self-conscious, 
        not sure how to act or what sort of welcome to expert. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needn't have worried. Simon's mother welcomed me as 
        warmly as his aunt had done in New York on the day of my arrival in the 
        New World back in September. I shall always be grateful to her and her 
        son for my first Thanksgiving, in the City of Brotherly Love. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Bowdoin a few weeks later, a fraternity brother 
        called Harold Tucker asked me if I'd like to spend Christmas with his 
        family in Florida. Hal's father was a reverend, originally from Rhode 
        Island, but had just been given a new parish in Daytona Beach. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another timely invitation, immediately and gratefully 
        accepted. Till next week then, and the millennial year's final installment, 
        beneath palms. Some people hold that the new millennium does not actually 
        start until midnight, December 31, 2000. But who cares. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We as a species won't be around in another thousand, 
        or maybe as little as a hundred years, unless we pull our socks up and 
        try to save the planet from destruction by our own kind, possibly extinct 
        by then, NOW. </p>
