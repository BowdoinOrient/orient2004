      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Battle of Gettysburg in early July 1863, 
        the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia retreated south towards the 
        Potomac River and the safety of the Virginian shore. Union General George 
        G. Meade's Army of the Potomac slowly followed, but instead of bringing 
        on another engagement that could have ended the war then and there, Meade 
        let Lee escape.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Gettysburg, Oliver Howard had intended to reclaim 
        his lost reputation after the disastrous rout of his corps at Chancellorsville 
        in May. But instead, Howard's Eleventh Corps, after going into battle 
        on the first day of Gettysburg, was routed yet again. For the rest of 
        the fight, the Eleventh clung onto the high defenses of Cemetery Ridge 
        and earned the disrespect of numerous members of Meade's army. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Otis Howard was not used to failure. He was a 
        tall, broad shouldered soldier with a squared-jaw and serious complexion. 
        He had lost an arm during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 and left his 
        sleeve hanging empty even though prosthetics were available. His battle 
        scars would show that he was a fighter. Since the opening guns of the 
        War, he had known that his duty was to preserve the Union and advance 
        up the military ladder. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as Howard was a fighter, he was also ambitious. 
        Graduating with high standing at both Bowdoin College and the Military 
        Academy at West Point, Howard's career had shown him to be a strong soldier 
        with some talent. That is, until he was assigned to command the Eleventh 
        Corps. Then his star began to fall and Howard did not like that one bit. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to Maine in August for a visit with 
        his family, Howard stopped over in Washington to petition for another 
        command. His petition failed and he returned to his corps, now assigned 
        the mediocre task of guarding communications in the rear of the army. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things seemed downcast for Howard. There seemed to be 
        no future in the army and he probably believed that his name was soon 
        to fade like so many other generals. But fate shined his way when a new 
        opportunity for distinction came in September 1863.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Northern Georgia, the Union Army of the Cumberland 
        was facing a reinforced Confederate force under General Braxton Bragg. 
        At Chickamauga Creek, on September 19 and 20, Bragg's forces crushed the 
        Federal army and sent its commander, General William S. Rosecrans, flying 
        in retreat with the bulk of his men towards Chattanooga, Tennessee. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the bold stand of Union General George H. Thomas 
        halted the Confederate breakthrough long enough for a successful Union 
        disengagement. Still, Rosecrans's army was soon surrounded in Chattanooga 
        with no supply route and no hope of liberation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lincoln administration acted swiftly. Orders were 
        drafted to send Howard's Eleventh Corps and Henry W. Slocum's Twelfth 
        Corps under the overall command of General Joseph Hooker to Tennessee 
        to help Rosecrans. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard, most likely thrilled at the assignment, probably 
        was not too thrilled with serving under Hooker once again. He considered 
        Hooker to be a man of low morals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Hooker, the former commander of the Army of the 
        Potomac probably didn't like the idea of serving with Howard either-Hooker 
        blamed Howard for the defeat of his army at Chancellorsville. Whatever 
        the differences between the two, the movement to rescue Rosecrans got 
        underway. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before departing with his men by rail on the 26th of 
        September, Howard dropped by to see President Lincoln. It was the last 
        time that the two would meet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail trip was relatively fast and soon enough Howard 
        detrained with his men at Bridgeport, still thirty miles short of Chattanooga's 
        western entrance. There, the two corps from the east stayed. Their advance 
        on Chattanooga would only increase the need for supplies in the city, 
        which was completely blocked from the outside world. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a month, the men did not move. Then on October 19, 
        Rosecrans was relieved and a new commander for the department was named. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ulysses S. Grant, the victor of Vicksburg, arrived 
        on the 23, and although he was at the time handicapped by a fall from 
        his horse, he insisted on entering Chattanooga. Through muddy roads and 
        dangerous passages, Grant's small escort got him into the city. Within 
        a few days, things began to stir.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant authorized a three-pronged plan to liberate the 
        Army of the Cumberland. Using Hooker's column to move from Bridgeport 
        towards Lookout Valley, to the southeast of Chattanooga, Grant hoped that 
        this move would protect the supply line he was planning to open to the 
        northeast. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movement began on the 27th with two divisions of 
        the Eleventh Corps and one from the Twelfth. On October 28, the Eleventh 
        Corps was encamped three and a half miles from the town of Wauhatchie, 
        where the Twelfth Corps division under General John Geary rested. Having 
        skirmished with retreating Confederates all day, Howard was weary of the 
        area.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had reason to be. That night, General Bragg ordered 
        elements of Confederate General James Longstreet's corps to attack this 
        wing of Grant's advance. Longstreet sent four brigades under General Micah 
        Jenkins to assault the isolated Federal division at Wauhatchie.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around midnight, Jenkins struck hard and fast. Geary's 
        veterans put up a good fight and a fierce contest continued for two hours. 
        The moment the Confederates opened fire on Geary, Howard ordered his men 
        to march to his aid. He didn't get far. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard wrote: "We had hardly got the Corps under way 
        before we were fired on from a range of hills or spurs on our left as 
        we marched along-My troops drove the rebels from these hills and opened 
        communication…"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever Howard's assertions of a victory, it seems 
        that his corps had been halted by a rearguard left behind by Jenkins to 
        protect the rebel escape route. However, Howard's position may have forced 
        Jenkin's Confederates to retreat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threatened with fighting on two fronts, the rebels withdrew, 
        leaving four hundred casualties. Howard's men drove the rebels from their 
        positions only after they had withdrawn themselves. Howard then rejoined 
        Geary and the fight for Wauhatchie was over.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Howard was not entirely responsible for the Union 
        victory (Geary had held his own), his men did help in winning the contest. 
        The Union supply line was secure. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant waited another month for reinforcements, which 
        came from William Tecumseh Sherman's Army of the Tennessee. By November 
        22, Grant was ready to liberate Chattanooga. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard's corps was detached from Hooker's command and 
        sent into Chattanooga to serve as a reserve for either Sherman or Thomas. 
        On November 24, 1863, the Battle of Chattanooga began. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Union right, Hooker's command charged up Lookout 
        Mountain, a towering fortress that seemed impossible to take by storm. 
        Bragg had stupidly sent Longstreet's corps to Knoxville and had weakened 
        his flank so much that Hooker's men were soon at the top, chasing the 
        rebels before them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left, Sherman's entire army, including reinforcements 
        from Howard, were unable to break the Confederate right flank held by 
        a division under General Patrick Cleburne. Despite Sherman's lack of progress, 
        the battle ended when George Thomas's newly energized Army of the Cumberland 
        charged in parade-style grandeur straight into the rebel center, shattering 
        Bragg's command.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard witnessed the entire battle but took almost no 
        part in it. While undoubtedly disappointed, he would soon get his share 
        of fighting. The tide of the War had turned, and now, as Grant went east 
        to deal with Robert E. Lee, Sherman set his eyes on the heart of the Confederacy 
        at Atlanta.<br>
