      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin sophomore Tom Scifres was arrested in front 
        of Burnett House on Tuesday, November 21 and charged with obstructing 
        government administration, police reports indicate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brunswick Police Sergeant Tom Ridlon had pulled over 
        a red Honda owned by an unidentified teenager in front of the social house, 
        and, according to witnesses, Scifres stood by as the officer searched 
        the vehicle. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scifres was asked twice by the officer to go inside 
        the house, and when he refused, Ridlon placed him under arrest, witnesses 
        said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scifres, who is a resident of Burnett House, is being 
        charged with a Class D offense and faces a court date in January.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Maine state law, Title 17-A Statute 751, 
        the crime of obstructing government administration entails the use of 
        "force, violence, or intimidation…with the intent to interfere with a 
        public servant performing or purporting to perform an official function."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the arrest took place, Scifres was standing on 
        the lawn in front of Burnett House approximately fifteen feet away from 
        the vehicle that was being searched, witnesses said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Scifres, Ridlon approached him and asked 
        him what he was doing. Scifres said that when he explained to the officer 
        that he was watching the search, the officer told him that he would have 
        to watch from inside, and that if he did not go inside the house, he would 
        be placed under arrest. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Scifres responded to the officer that he was under 
        the impression that he could watch the search as long as he remained a 
        safe distance away from the vehicle, the officer told him again that if 
        he did not go inside, he would be arrested.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses said that Scifres was placed under arrest 
        after he refused the officer's second request for him to leave.Scifres 
        was then handcuffed and frisked by Ridlon and placed in the squad car, 
        witnesses said. A second squad car then arrived on the scene, and Scifres 
        was again frisked and relocated to the second car, according to witnesses.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scifres said that when he asked the second officer if 
        he would be read his Miranda rights, the officer responded, "Get in the 
        car."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arresting officers took Scifres to the Brunswick 
        police station, where he was booked, processed, and held for approximately 
        an hour until his bail was posted. Scifres said that at no point in time 
        did officers inform him of his right to remain silent, or his right to 
        speak to an attorney.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have a great deal of respect for law enforcement 
        officers. I am outraged by the way in which the officers conducted themselves 
        on this day," Scifres said. Brunswick police declined to comment on the 
        arrest. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scifres's court date has been set for January 24. He 
        said he plans to plead not guilty if the court decides to hear his case.</p>
