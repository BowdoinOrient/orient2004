      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open forum earlier this month, students and faculty 
        met to discuss a future new look and feel for Bowdoin's online presence. 
        The forum was held with the web-designing firm Smash Advertising, affiliated 
        with Jan Krakowski and Co. of New York City. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's increasingly electronic world, a website 
        is vital to a college, not only for prospective students who rely increasingly 
        on online information and applications, but also for alumni who keep in 
        touch with the college through the internet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Bowdoin, students also depend on the college website 
        for everything from library research, to e-mail, to the online dining 
        hall menu.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, in 1995, Bowdoin's website consisted of 
        one page that said it was under construction. In the winter of 1996, a 
        former student employed at the communications office created a text-heavy 
        website with a brochure-like format. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Internet took off, the site has grown from 
        50-60 pages to 58,000 active server pages and is maintained by a webmaster. 
        However, due to the large volume of sites and the constant need for updating, 
        the management of the College's website has become more than a one-person 
        job.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a professional update has been more apparent 
        with the proliferation of prospective students who use the Internet to 
        help make their college decisions and to apply to college. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Scott Hood, director of communications 
        and public affairs, "If we have prospective students online, they want 
        a sense of the college, so they'll look at actual sites of interest. Our 
        website needs something there that's accurate and consistently lets you 
        know that you're at a Bowdoin webpage."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are no standards for the various pages 
        on the site, and each area or department can have its own style, its own 
        way of site navigation, and its own type of page-building software. All 
        these factors can lead to confusion and do not give web-surfers as structured 
        and user-friendly of an impression as the College would like.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smash Advertising has taken these concerns into consideration 
        and, according to Hood, will provide Bowdoin with more "streamlined and 
        simplified sites." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will return in February with prototypes from which 
        departments such as Computer Information Services (CIS) and the Educational 
        Technology Center (ETC) can choose. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the changes will require a major overhaul of 
        the system and are scheduled to be implemented this spring. The set goal 
        for completion of the project is the fall of 2001.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The web-redesigning will not be undertaken by Smash 
        alone. CIS, ETC, and the Communications Department have formed a web-developers 
        group that specializes in the technical aspects of the overhaul, while 
        the Web Working Group, composed of faculty and staff, will focus on the 
        more "hands-on" and content-related aspects of the website construction.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Bowdoin's goal in the website project is to 
        boost its online image and make the sites more standardized and simplified.</p>
