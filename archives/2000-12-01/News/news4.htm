      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the midst of the stress surrounding the last 
        few weeks of the semester, Student Government, comprised of both the Student 
        Executive Board and the Student Congress, is already working on a number 
        of initiatives to be presented next semester.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These initiatives include the installation of change 
        machines in on-campus laundry rooms, the establishment of a method to 
        efficiently deliver student notifications of parking violations, the creation 
        of an all-student photo directory (due out by the end of January), the 
        institution of a pilot program allowing students to receive free issues 
        of the New York Times, and the initiation of a "Professor of the Year" 
        award chosen by students.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government is working to expand the 
        hours of the Sills Language Media Center, to increase the amount of non-credit 
        courses available, and to create more twenty-four-hour study spaces and 
        computer labs on campus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term issues include sponsoring events and encouraging 
        active student participation in social, political, and civic issues; strengthening 
        relations between the College and the town of Brunswick; and working closely 
        with the student aid office to help address student issues and problems 
        that may arise.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey Favolise '01, chair of the Student Executive 
        Board, said he is excited about the more active role the Student Government 
        is taking this year with student issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're focusing on tangible things, on places where 
        students wish to see improvements. In doing this, we are both strengthening 
        ourselves and the entire community."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these initiatives, Student Government 
        has already made several changes this semester. "This has been a fantastic 
        year for the student government," Favolise said. "I couldn't be more pleased 
        with all the things that are going on."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the major successful changes have included the 
        promotion and financing of non-credit courses such as bartending and public 
        speaking, the expansion of the hours of the Hawthorne-Longfellow Library, 
        and the notification to the Bowdoin community of changes in parking policies 
        in Brunswick.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Student Government has also initiated the Student 
        Matters Committee, with the hope of encouraging students and faculty to 
        voice their opinions about campus issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee is central to a process that allows student 
        grievances and suggestions to be heard and discussed by the Student Congress 
        in a thorough and efficient manner. </p>
