      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To double major or not to double major?" was the question 
        proposed by student government facilitators Kyle Staller '04 and Jennifer 
        Cromwell '01 at the last Common Hour, a Campus Crosstalk debate sponsored 
        by Student Government.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate addressed the question of whether or not 
        double majoring is "contrary to the goals of a liberal arts education." 
        John Turner, a professor in the romance languages department, and John 
        Hahn '01 debated in favor of double majoring. Clifton Olds, a professor 
        in the art history department, and Dominique Alepin '03 debated against 
        it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Bowdoin, approximately one quarter of the student 
        body graduates with a double major, some as similar as sociology and anthropology, 
        and others as different as biology and philosophy. However, it is not 
        agreed as to whether or not double majoring goes against the idea of a 
        liberal arts education.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although both sides stood up for their opinions regarding 
        double majors, in the end, they seemed to agree that double majoring should 
        be neither forced nor prohibited.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alepin began the debate by saying, "The liberal arts 
        education is on the brink of extinction." She said that double majoring 
        limits a student's opportunities to take classes in different areas of 
        study, which is contrary to the very idea of a liberal arts education.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahn countered by saying, "The liberal arts education 
        is not static--it is always changing." He explained that although the 
        liberal arts education at one point may have repre sented the idea of 
        taking a wide variety of classes, today it represents the opportunity 
        to study several topics of interest in depth. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Hahn, the double major is a "fusion 
        of two areas of study that are complementary to each other." In that respect, 
        he said, the liberal arts education is still well-preserved in the concept 
        of a double major.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olds took his turn by saying, "The goals of a liberal 
        arts education include both depth and breadth….I don't debate that disciplines 
        can complement each other…but we [shouldn't] encourage students to double 
        major."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main arguments against double majoring was 
        the lack of breadth in one's subject material. However, Hahn said, "Although 
        I do agree with increasing breadth, at what cost? The cost of depth?…The 
        tradition of a double major provides both depth and some breadth."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turner explained his reasoning for encouraging double 
        majors by saying, "It is between things that truth seems to lie….Everything, 
        it turns out, is connected." By combining two disciplines, he said, one 
        is able to find that connection, and thus find truth.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahn said that he thought that the purpose of a college 
        education was to get skills to sell on the job market. "The double major 
        is a compromise of learning by a free-spirited approach and being competitive 
        in the job market." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, by double majoring, one can gain twice 
        as many skills that could be useful in finding a job after graduation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Turner, who also supported double majoring, 
        said that a liberal arts education is for a life well lived, not for a 
        career. He did say, though, that double majoring is good for students 
        who change careers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alepin responded by asking, "It's not what you major 
        in, it's what you do here….Should you embrace what is offered here at 
        Bowdoin or prepare yourself for the work world?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, both Turner and Olds agreed that the job 
        market is not interested so much in what one majors in, but in how well 
        one does while at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, Turner maintained that "what you can do here 
        that you won't be able to do later in life is…to commit yourselves to…pursuing 
        two things with great seriousness."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olds, on the other hand, said, "Your time at Bowdoin 
        should not be a time for limiting your horizons, it should be a time for 
        expanding them."</p>
