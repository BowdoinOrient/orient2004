      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Men's Hockey Team, currently tied for NESCAC's 
        top spot with three other teams, lost to RIT 6-3, and battled to a 3-3 
        tie with Brockport this weekend in the Bowdoin-Colby Face-Off Classic. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first round of competition, Bowdoin (2-1-1) dominated 
        the first period with RIT (7-0-0) and posted a 2-1 at the break. Mike 
        Carosi '02 put away the first goal of the game with 5:10 elapsed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, sophomore Ryan Seymour found Sean 
        Starke '03 in front of the net for a 2-0 score. Despite the early deficit, 
        RIT came back, scoring the next five goals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by the play of senior Peter Bournazakis, the Tigers 
        went on to net yet another later in the third period, a minute after Bowdoin's 
        Adam Mantin '03 finished a short-handed goal with about ten minutes to 
        play.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are parts of our game we need to improve in," 
        Coach Terry Meagher said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We certainly learned from playing that game. For our 
        young team I was pleased."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Colin Robinson rejected 31 shots in goal before 
        first-year Mike Healey stepped in, saving six. RIT's Tyler Euverman turned 
        away 29 for the win.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day found the Bears facing Brockport in the 
        Face-Off Classic's consolation game. Nine minutes in, Brockport's Darren 
        Kennedy started things off with a power play goal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drew Morley then put the Golden Eagles up 2-0 with 13 
        minutes to play in the second period. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minute later, however, Starke put Bowdoin on the board 
        with assists from Chris Pelletier '04 and Seymour. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less than five minutes to play in the third period, 
        the same two would assist Jared Porter '03 for Bowdoin's second goal. 
        Bill Busch '02 completed the scoring off first-years Mike O'Neill and 
        Mike Stevens with 2:19 remaining. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin fired 35 shots at Brockport's Tom Payment, outpacing 
        the Golden Eagles's 25 shots. Healey turned away 22 in net. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were down 3-1, and fought our way back to tie the 
        game," Coach Meagher stated. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fact that the team never gave up is a very positive 
        indicator of what we can do."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears' next three games are home match-ups. Catch 
        them tonight as they take on Salem State at 7:00 and Southern Maine visits 
        Bowdoin tomorrow at 4:00. Next Tuesday, the Polar Bears will face its 
        arch-rival, and constant punching bag, Colby.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Meagher indicated that Salem State should be a 
        strong opponent. "They've been a great rival of ours, and it should be 
        a tough test," he said. "We're excited; we're a very young team, but are 
        getting solid leadership from the upper classes. We're hoping to be a 
        better team with each game." </p>
