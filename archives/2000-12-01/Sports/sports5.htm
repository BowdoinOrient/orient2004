      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wish you could go skiing all year round? The Bowdoin 
        Nordic Ski Team does just that.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've probably seen them skating around on their roller 
        skis in early September, when the only snow at Bowdoin is piled up awkwardly 
        outside Dayton Arena. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's all part of a year-long training program, instituted 
        by the team's new coach, Marty Hall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will encourage all skiers to train on a year round 
        basis," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With a training program and support that will provide 
        the necessary development to allow each skier to realize their potential."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hall joined Bowdoin's Nordic Ski Team last year, replacing 
        Mike Yeo as the head coach. Hardly a newcomer to coaching, Hall has had 
        an impressive career. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He coached the Canadian national women's ski team as 
        well as the American national team. Now he plans to make champions out 
        of the eleven skiers on the Polar Bear team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, Hall came to Bowdoin very much by chance. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used to run skiing camps in Silver Star, British 
        Columbia, where Cecily Upton '03, had trained in past years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that Bowdoin was looking for a new coach, she 
        called Marty to ask if he knew of anyone who could fill the position. 
        Much to her delight, he told her that he was interested.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was so exited to have Marty as a coach," said Upton. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since coming to Bowdoin, he's been great. He's really 
        good at mixing up training so he makes everyone excited to go to practice. 
        I've already noticed so much improvement since last year, just in terms 
        of our strength and technique." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most practices for the Nordic Ski team include a combination 
        of strength training and distance exercises. The team often does slow 
        runs or skis that last up to two hours; this training continues throughout 
        the academic year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin's competitive season begins in December. Traveling 
        to various winter carnivals, Bowdoin's nordic skiers compete against most 
        other small liberal arts colleges as well as facing off against Dartmouth 
        and UVM. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are six carnivals every year, in which 12 schools 
        compete. Lasting two days, the carnivals consist of several different 
        events including relays, short 5K races, and long 15K or 20K races. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with Squash and Alpine Skiing, Bowdoin's Nordic 
        Ski team is one of three Division I teams at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's pretty competitive," said Upton. "This year we 
        hope to qualify for the NCAA finals to compete against schools in the 
        Western Conference like the University of Colorado and the University 
        of Nevada." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Katie Matthews '01 and Wade Kavanaugh '01 are both hopefuls 
        for this year's finals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the team has not started competing yet this year, 
        they finished the '99-'00 season on a good note. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their last competition was at the EISA championships, 
        held at the Middlebury winter carnival. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin finished 10th out of 19 schools with many noteworthy 
        individual accomplishments. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diann Wood '03 finished 39th out of 63 in the women's 
        5K race. In addition, Wade Kavanaugh finished 31st out of 70 in the men's 
        20K race.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Nordic Ski team has already begun training, 
        they'll embark on an intense three weeks of hard work over winter vacation. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to Bowdoin in early January, the team will 
        travel to a ski camp in Mount Saint Anne in Quebec and continue their 
        training at Sugar Loaf and Lake Placid. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the competitive season fast approaches, they are 
        definitely looking to bury the competition under a big pile of snow. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marty Hall certainly looks forward to this, saying, 
        "Our competitive season will begin in December and carry through to the 
        end of March in our pursuit of excellence and success for each skier and 
        the team."<br>
