      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Women's Basketball Team has begun the season 
        in true form-with three wins and one loss. Coach Stephanie Pemper is beginning 
        her third season at Bowdoin; she will be joined by Kathleen Higgins, a 
        former Williams College basketball and softball standout. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Bowdoin may have a very young team, they are 
        certainly not at a loss for talent. Jessie Mayol '02 and Kristi Royer 
        '03 were both named to the All-NESCAC Third Team last season, while Lauren 
        Myers '01 is only four points shy of one thousand. The impressive first-year 
        class is led by Lora Trenkle'04, who has already asserted herself as a 
        consistent top-scorer. This year's team is captained by Jamie Bennett 
        '01, Myers, and Mayol.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team's season began on November 17th, at the Lake 
        Forest tournament in Chicago. Although Bowdoin lost the first game to 
        Hope, 43-61, the team came back to defeat Lake Forest 77-69, the next 
        day. Royer led the Polar Bears in scoring against Hope, with 11 points. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trenkle's stellar performance of 26 points and 14 rebounds 
        paced Bowdoin's victory over Lake Forest, and her efforts were rewarded, 
        as she was named to the All-Tournament team. Myers contributed 14 points 
        to the scoring effort, while Lindsay Bramwell '04 added 8.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 21st, the lady Polar Bears took their second 
        victory; defeating the University of New England in a lop-sided contest 
        resulting in a score of 88-57. Trenkle led the scoring effort with 14 
        points, while Royer chipped in with 13. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bramwell and Kristina Fugate '04 both scored 10 points 
        and Myers and Mayol also contributed an impressive 9 points each. Trenkle 
        led the team in assists, while Royer dominated the boards. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin basketball earned an impressive win over University 
        of Southern Maine, 77-62, on Tuesday. This game bore special significance, 
        as USM has not lost to Bowdoin since 1981. The scoring effort was led 
        by Trenkle, who earned 24 for the Polar Bears. Also making sizable contributions 
        were Myers and Mayol, who each had 14.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayol also made some incredible passes and led the team 
        in assists with 6; Nicole Fava '03 earned 7 points and also had her share 
        of assists and rebounds. Although some tough calls on Royer caused her 
        to foul out of the game, she did manage to lead the team in rebounds and 
        scored 5 points. Also scoring for Bowdoin were Bramwell (4 points), Bennett 
        (4 points), and Courtney Trotta '04 (5 points). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Women's Basketball Team is on the right 
        track. Standing at 3-1 at this point in the season, the Lady Polar Bears 
        are looking to improve their record this weekend against Babson. At this 
        contest, Meyers will be looking to surpass the 1,000-point benchmark, 
        as she only has two field goals to go. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a young team, Bowdoin can keep an eye on future 
        seasons, but also has some important goals for this one. Mayol speaks 
        for the team: "We are aiming to finish in the top four in the NESCAC and 
        to qualify for the NCAA tournament…I'm excited to see what can come of 
        the talent and charisma that we have this year." </p>
