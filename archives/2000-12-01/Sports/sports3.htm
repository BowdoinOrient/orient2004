      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winter track season has begun and the women are working 
        towards a top-five finish in New England. Last season Bowdoin placed behind 
        Wheaton, Williams and Tufts amongst the twenty other Division III schools 
        in New England.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colby will be another tough rival this season. Bowdoin 
        and Colby's women's teams battled back and forth last season. Each match 
        up proved to be a truly competitive test, often with as little as two 
        and a half points deciding the victor. Colby claimed the Maine State Title 
        last winter, however the Polar Bears will provide another season of fierce 
        competition and hope to claim the State Title for Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that cross country season is officially over, the 
        distance runners can prepare for their races on the track ranging from 
        800-5000 meters. Meredith Godreau '04, who placed 88th at nationals a 
        few weeks ago, will be a strong force in the 3000m and the 5000m races. 
        Libby Barney '03, Bre-Anne McKenna '03 and Kala Hardacker '04 are all 
        in top shape to race the 800m or the 1000m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returning members of the track team turned out various 
        noteworthy performances last season. At the Maine State Meet last year, 
        Shaina Zamitis '02 won the 600m, Julia Febiger '03 won the 400m and Sara 
        Bodnar '03 won the 55m dash. As for the field events Casey Kelly '02 and 
        Karen Yeoman '02 have returned to lead the way in the triple jumps. Yeoman 
        currently holds the school record in the triple jump. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delia Van Loenen, who '02 holds the record in the long 
        jump, high jump and pentathlon, will be a great addition to the team this 
        season since she was sidelined last season with an injury. Kate Waller 
        '02 and Marika Decyk '02, who holds the school record for pole vault, 
        will be strong forces in vaulting, while Shanique Brown '04 shows promise 
        in the throwing events.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a team filled with such impressive performances 
        it is clear that Bowdoin's Women's Track Team will be tough to beat. However, 
        the team did lose a few integral seniors last year. Amy Trumball was All-American 
        in the 800m last year and Maine State Meet champion in the 1000m run. 
        Former co-captain Stacey Jones won the Maine State Meet for both the shot 
        put and the weight throw. Also, Vicky Shen, former co-captain, will be 
        greatly missed as an asset to the distance events.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, with the new talent that the team has acquired 
        with this class of first years, and the returning talent of the upperclassmen, 
        Bowdoin has a promising season to look forward to. </p>
