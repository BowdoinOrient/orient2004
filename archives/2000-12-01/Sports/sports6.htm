      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's squash team is looking at a successful 
        season ahead of them. The Bears have eight returning players to fill up 
        the top of the ladder. Bowdoin has gained five new players including two 
        who have made it into the top ten positions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leading the women are seniors Kate Lubin, Laura Inkeles, 
        and Anne Stevenson with co-captains Dana Betts and Liz Steffey at the 
        helm.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears are eagerly awaiting the arrival of their 
        new coach, Tomas Fortson. Fortson has been hired from Mexico as the head 
        coach of the men's and women's team. He comes highly recommended from 
        Groton where he coached two years ago while the head coach was on sabbatical. 
        Fortson has been detained for a couple of weeks, however, due to visa 
        issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortson and the team have been bridging the gap though 
        email and frequent phone calls to the captains about drills for practice 
        and conditioning. So far the assistant coach, John Moncure, and Charlie 
        Butt have been leading the practices with the assistance of the captains. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team opened the season by beating Colby 
        quite handily. Everyone won their matches, which led to a final score 
        of 9-0. Colby has improved incredibly over the past four years, yet they 
        were no match for the Bears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Colby was quick and ran for everything, Bowdoin 
        was just more experienced and played smarter squash. Superstar sophomore 
        Merrill Muckerman commented, "We looked like a team on Wednesday. There 
        was a lot of positive attitude out there. Colby isn't a bad team- we just 
        have more depth. We are heading off to a great start." She also noted 
        that "Dana and Liz are doing a very good job of taking control of our 
        team in the face of not having our coach. Our team is really going to 
        take off when our three juniors return from studying abroad next semester." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team plays its next match on Dec. 2nd at 
        Wesleyan. </p>
