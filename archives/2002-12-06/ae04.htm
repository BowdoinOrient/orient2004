      <p align="left">Over and over again I have been told not to pop bubble wrap. 
        I have also been told not to touch art in the museum. I think I may finally 
        be able to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The Bowdoin Disconnection&quot; is an interactive art installation 
        which does not adhere to the usual rules. One of the installatations, 
        entitled &quot;bubble.edu,&quot; allows the viewer to pop bubble wrap 
        while musing about abstract notions like the Bowdoin bubble. This is just 
        one example of the many creative projects that the students of French 
        328 are currently getting ready for the show.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Consisting of nine installations, &quot;The Bowdoin Disconnection&quot; 
        will take over the second floor of Sills, next Tuesday. Two students worked 
        on each installation. Most of the artwork will be displayed inside classrooms 
        on the second floor of Sills although some will hang on the stairways 
        as well.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The idea behind the show is the everyday experience. Specifically, students 
        examined the everyday experience here at Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Projects range from female activism on campus to a look at what goes on 
        in the dining hall behind the scenes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lilly Keller '03 and Courtney Gribbon '03 designed a project based on 
        maps of Bowdoin. Their installation compares the traditional map of Bowdoin 
        to a map that might be drawn by a senior after living on campus for four 
        years. &quot;They'll probably show secret passageways,&quot; said Jill 
        Bouyea '03, who is also a member of the class. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bouyea's project addresses similar themes. Specifically, she addresses 
        the issue of conformity on campus and the pressure for students to act 
        one way during the week and a different way during the weekend.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In a project entitled &quot;Bowdoin Women in Sport: a Vision of Today 
        and Yesterday. Can they balance a profession? Is motherhood a profession&quot; 
        Leah Bressack '04 and Gillian McDonald '04 compared interviews of current 
        students with students who graduated in 1986.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bressack's and McDonald's focus was on how female students, particularly 
        athletes, coneptualized their future. They wanted to know if playing sports 
        had anything to do with how they planned for their careers and planned 
        to raise their families.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking at fraternity life at Bowdoin, Louis Plough '03 and Bitzi Gerasimova 
        '05, designed a project focusing on the differences between public space 
        and private space. Their art revolves around a look at the house system 
        and how it has changed residential life in ways beyond just drinking. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Working on this project has been very rewarding,&quot; said Plough. 
        &quot;I haven't done much visual art on campus before so I've definitely 
        enjoyed the opportunity.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Professor Alexandre Dauge-Roth who instructs French 328, is certain that 
        all students, regardless of their knowledge of French, will enjoy the 
        exhibit. &quot;The show is really about the theories of the everyday,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;We wanted to use Bowdoin as the site of investigation and 
        focus on Bowdoin's everyday life.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        For much of the semester, the students of French 328 have been reading 
        anthropology, sociology, and philosophy-all in French mind you-that addresses 
        issues related to the everyday experience.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition, they studied some contemporary artists. Focusing on performance 
        art and interactive installations, they watched documentaries and looked 
        at pictures done by a variety of artists. Sophie Calle, a contemporary 
        French artist, is one example of someone the class studied. Her work, 
        such as an installation entitled &quot;Ritual Birthday,&quot; examines 
        abstract concepts such as giving gifts, social status, and taste, all 
        through the lens of everyday experiences like birthdays.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Because few of the installations are written in French, this exhibit can 
        appeal to any Bowdoin student. Its installations aim to provide provocative 
        angles with which to investigate issues on campus.</p>
