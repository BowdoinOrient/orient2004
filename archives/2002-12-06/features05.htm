        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        </font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;Is there really such a thing as too 
        much exercise?&quot; B.D.</p>
      <p>Dear G.M.: The Surgeon General, the National Institutes of Health, and 
        the American College of Sports Medicine have all long advocated regular, 
        moderate-intensity exercise. These recommendations are based on a very 
        long series of epidemiologic studies that show that moderate exercise 
        is protective against heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, 
        colon cancer, and anxiety and depression, among many other problems. Thirty 
        minutes or so per day, most days of the week, is considered adequate. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Now, if thirty minutes per day is good, is 60 minutes better? Or 90 minutes? 
        Or more? Well -- it depends! And probably most importantly, on your diet. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Muscles preferably burn carbohydrates for fuel, primarily in the form 
        of glycogen, which is stored in liver and muscle cells. Glycogen stores 
        are used up, however, in about 90 minutes or so of moderate-intensity 
        exercise -- if no additional carbohydrates are taken in before or during 
        the workout. When glycogen stores run low, muscles start burning protein 
        (mainly by cannibalizing themselves) for energy. The result is fatigue, 
        &quot;bonking&quot;, or &quot;hitting the wall.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        There's not much you can do to expand your glycogen stores beyond this 
        90-minute capacity. You do need to replenish your stores with carbohydrate-rich 
        snacks after exercising, and to maintain them with carbohydrate-adequate 
        meals every day. If they're not adequately replenished, you'll just hit 
        that &quot;wall&quot; even faster! You also need those carbs to fuel tissue 
        repair and to help build up muscle mass. A reasonable guideline is 6 - 
        7 grams of carbohydrate/kilogram of body weight/day, if you're exercising 
        at moderate intensity for an hour daily. You'll also need to eat enough 
        protein, of course: about one gram/kilogram/day to maintain muscle mass, 
        more to build it up.</p>
      <p align="left">
        And then there's your skeleton. Regular weight-bearing exercise is needed 
        to build-up bone strength. Over-exercising, however, can actually decrease 
        bone density. A number of other factors can as well, including excessive 
        intake of salt, caffeine, soft drinks, alcohol, Vitamin A and protein. 
        Caloric restriction, or inadequate caloric intake for exercise needs, 
        is particularly harmful to bones. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Poor nutrition has direct metabolic effects on bone growth and repair. 
        In addition, low body weight itself prevents bone strengthening, by not 
        providing adequate mechanical support for bone motion. Most importantly 
        for women, however, is a critical balance between exercise, nutrition 
        and hormonal function. Adequate estrogen levels are crucial for building 
        calcium into bones. Over-exercising quickly leads to decreased estrogen 
        production and loss of bone density. If you're not on birth control pills, 
        estrogen loss will be signaled first by amenorrhea, or loss of your periods. 
        In this setting, amenorrhea is a clear warning sign that you are over-exercising 
        or under-eating -- or both. Birth control pills will not replace this 
        lost estrogen. And because you'll still get your &quot;pill periods&quot; 
        (and so won't have an early warning sign), you might need medical and 
        nutritional assessment to determine your risk for osteoporosis.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We exercise for a variety of reasons. Most are health-promoting, but unfortunately, 
        not all. Like eating disorders, some exercising is in no small part driven 
        by our cultural preoccupations with distorted, idealized body images and 
        lifestyle expectations. This is particularly true for &quot;obligatory&quot; 
        or &quot;compulsive exercisers,&quot; who repeatedly exercise beyond the 
        requirements of good health or training, often beyond the limits of what 
        is safe. For them, exercise is no longer fun or satisfying, no longer 
        even a free choice. It becomes something necessary and essential, an obligation 
        to meet, in spite of injuries, too much time taken away from other activities, 
        and possibly damaged relationships. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many people who struggle with disordered eating also struggle with compulsive 
        exercising. It becomes a way to burn calories, to &quot;gain permission&quot; 
        to eat, to &quot;relieve the guilt&quot; of having eaten or binged. Exercise 
        becomes another way to purge, another way to try to take control and hide 
        from emotional pain. Quite appropriately, this kind of exercise has been 
        called &quot;Anorexia Athletica&quot;. It cries out for the same multi-disciplinary, 
        long-term treatments required by all eating disorders. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So: try to eat a rounded, well-balanced diet, and Happy (Moderate) Exercising!</p>
