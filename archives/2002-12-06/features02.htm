      <p align="left">From Biology Professor Nat Wheelwright's corner office in 
        Druckenmiller, one can marvel at the majesty of the Bowdoin Pines, a shelter 
        for wildlife and an endless source of fascination.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;My laboratory is outside the door,&quot; Wheelwright said, smiling 
        as he gazes out generous windows.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin is known for the strength of its science programs, and if one 
        traces the strength of any program to the people who teach it, it is easy 
        to understand why our school can boast. Wheelwright said that Bowdoin 
        offers its science professors an &quot;unusual, but optimal, balance between 
        teaching and professional engagement.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        What does that mean?</p>
      <p align="left">
        To Wheelwright, it means that Bowdoin recognizes that teaching science 
        demands a hands-on approach. &quot;It's simply the way you do science,&quot; 
        he said. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As Director of the Bowdoin Scientific Station at Kent Island, Wheelwright 
        has plenty to put his hands on, and plenty of time to do it. Each summer 
        he leads a team of around eight undergraduates, several graduate students, 
        and other faculty members to do intensive research at the facility, located 
        on an island in the Bay of Fundy. There, he focuses on his research while 
        guiding others in their own projects. He especially enjoys how the two-month 
        field season allows students to escape the culture of the lecture hall 
        and allow their learning to grow from pure curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Wheelwright got an early start in teaching when he was an 11 year-old 
        in western Massachusetts, serving as a guide at a local Audubon nature 
        sanctuary. Teaching has always seemed to be natural to him, but despite 
        a fascination with natural history, biology was not always the field of 
        choice.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;When I was a sophomore at Yale a friend of mine at the School of 
        Forestry told me about a course he was taking where they identified trees 
        by twigs they found in the snow,&quot; Wheelwright remembers. &quot;I 
        joined the class and had a blast, and suddenly I switched from an English 
        major to Biology.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        He took six classes a semester in order to graduate in four years, immediately 
        following which he was hired by Yale to conduct research in Colombia and 
        Ecuador. He maintains close ties with Central America, including Costa 
        Rica, where he has an ongoing research project dealing with tropical trees. 
        Last year Wheelwright received his fourth National Science Foundation 
        Grant, this one for a joint research project with former Bowdoin student 
        Corey Freeman-Gallant. Wheelwright also recently presented a paper at 
        the North American Ornithological Conference in New Orleans, where he 
        was joined by seven former students, who also presented. He has been invited 
        to seminars in such diverse places as Bolivia, Spain, Botswana, England, 
        and South Africa.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Wheelwright focuses increasingly on ecological issues, and he tries to 
        integrate those issues in his classes here, which include Introductory 
        Biology courses as well as more advanced topics such as Ornithology. While 
        Biology is a demanding major, Wheelwright sees benefits for non-majors 
        as well, stressing that being &quot;ecologically literate&quot; is important.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;There is a lot to learn from plants and animals and the way they 
        have developed,&quot; he says. &quot;We face a number of environmental 
        problems, including population growth and the loss of biodiversity.&quot; 
        His seemingly relaxed disposition is a bit more on edge now, and one realizes 
        that he has certainly seen the effects of these problems first-hand. &quot;I 
        think a world with less biodiversity will be a fundamentally less satisfying 
        world for everyone.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        But for Wheelwright, the best weapon against these problems is awareness, 
        and he hopes to foster a love and understanding for the natural world: 
        &quot;You cannot love the natural world without understanding it, and 
        you cannot understand it without loving it.&quot;</p>
