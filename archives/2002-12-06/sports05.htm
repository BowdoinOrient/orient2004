      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Men's Cross-Country Team finished eighth out 
        of 24 teams at the NCAA Division III Championship at St. Olaf College, 
        Minnesota on November 23rd. The results were an improvement over Bowdoin's 
        2001 eleventh place nationals finish. The men's team (267 points) was 
        the second New England school, trailing seventh place Williams College 
        by only 11 points. </p>
      <p align="left">
        First place Wisconsin Oshkosh tallied 66 points, while second place Calvin 
        College scored 122. The two other competing New England teams, Keene State 
        and Connecticut College, finished twelfth and twentieth, respectively. 
        A week earlier, the Bowdoin men had finished second to Keene State at 
        the New England DIII Championship.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The mid 40 degree temperatures in Northfield were optimal for the Bowdoin 
        runners, who had endured sleet and hail a week earlier at the regional 
        championship. The championship race was marked by several outstanding 
        individual performances by Bowdoin runners. Co-captain Todd Forsgren '03 
        finished in thirty-fourth place in a time of 25:47, while Scott Barbuto 
        '03 finished in thirty-ninth place in 25:51. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Because Forsgren placed in the top 35 runners, he was named an All American 
        for the second consecutive year. Scott Barbuto and Todd Forsgren had the 
        races of the day, running heroically with the lead pack for the entire 
        race. After the race, an elated Barbuto-a scientist and patron of the 
        arts--quoted the Roman lyricist Horace: &quot;Exegi monumentum aere perennius!&quot; 
        (I have erected a monument more lasting than bronze).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Co-captain Pat Vardaro'03 crossed the line in 26:14, finishing seventy-seventh 
        overall. Co-captain Jeff Rubens '03 and Ben Peisch '05 were the fourth 
        and fifth runners for Bowdoin, finishing in 113th and 116th place, respectively. 
        The top seven runners were rounded out by senior Dan Gulotta (174) and 
        junior Scott Herrick (196). The race was won by senior Ryan Bak from Trinity 
        College, in a time of 25:01.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Peisch described the start of the race: &quot;It was crazy. Bodies were 
        flying everywhere. I thought I had gotten off the line well and had put 
        myself into a good position, but after the race I found out that Dan Gulotta 
        and I were almost in last place at the mile mark! If I had known this 
        while I was running, I probably would have flipped out and had a nervous 
        breakdown or something, so I guess ignorance is bliss when it comes to 
        running at Nationals.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Peisch and Gulotta ran smart races, and despite starting in the back, 
        both finished in the middle of pack.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Vardaro, an avid outdoorsman, enjoyed the sites and sounds of the trip: 
        &quot;The beauty of Minnesota certainly inspired me to run faster. As 
        far as the eye can see there are rolling hills, lush forests, brooks and 
        streams, and many gaggles of geese. Now that I have my hunting license, 
        I wish I had brought my gun.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Head Coach Peter Slovenski was pleased with the team's efforts from the 
        first race to the last: &quot;There were so many terrific contributions 
        to the program that we ended up with a very powerful season. The more 
        the students gave, the more they got back from the team.&quot; He continued, 
        &quot;This has been the best class of seniors we've ever had in cross 
        country at Bowdoin. I'm proud of how this class improved each year and 
        I'm proud of how well they worked together. It's a great testimony to 
        their intelligence, hard work and talent that they finished as the eighth 
        best team in Division III.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Herrick echoed Coach Slovenski's sentiments: &quot;The seven seniors were 
        a great presence on the team all season. They will be missed next year.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Rubens, who laced up his cross-country spikes for the final time on Saturday, 
        explained the effect of having strong team chemistry: &quot;Working together 
        for four years made us want to run well in this race as much for each 
        other, as for ourselves. We had a lot of talented individuals wearing 
        a Bowdoin jersey on Saturday, but more importantly, we had a strong team.&quot; 
        Rubens continued: &quot;Our team camaraderie was instrumental to our success 
        over the past few years. &quot;The seven of us wanted to end this season 
        without any regrets. We all pushed ourselves to the fullest, and we are 
        very proud of the results.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        After the race, the men's and women's teams went on brief tours of the 
        world-famous Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and the Malt-o-Meal 
        Cereal Plant and the Jesse James Museum in Northfield, Minnesota.</p>
