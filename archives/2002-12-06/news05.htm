      <p align="left">As a result of several factors that influence the showing 
        of films on campus, Bowdoin College has decided to become stricter in 
        terms of enforcing copyright laws concerning the viewing of videos by 
        groups of students. Public performance laws demand that a fee be paid 
        if the film in question is being shown to a wider audience. If the film 
        is shown without paying the fees, the company that owns the film can fine 
        the college.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Associate Dean of Student Affairs, Deb DeGraff, however, emphasized that 
        &quot;Nothing has changed, but the college has established a new policy 
        to try to ensure that we are doing everything we can to adhere to the 
        copyright law in terms of how videos and dvds are used in the classroom.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        While the larger film presences on campus - such as the Bowdoin Film Society 
        and BCN - already strictly adhere to copyright law, it is the more informal 
        cases of film showings that are in danger of infringing on required regulations. 
        &quot;Copyright law regarding videos and films has been that they can 
        be used for instructional purposes at educational institutions without 
        acquiring copyright but that is only to be used in the context of the 
        class. For use in the classroom, you don't need the public performance 
        rights for anything that is shown, said DeGraff.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The question now surrounds showings in the classroom-which are being advertised 
        as open to a wider audience and which are simply being shown to students 
        in the course. The law strictly states that &quot;you can only show the 
        films to students involved in the class,&quot; for example, said DeGraff, 
        &quot;You can't allow other non-participating students or Brunswick citizens 
        who are aware of the film showing to sit in.&quot; As a result, Bowdoin 
        College has taken steps to ensure that these infringements do not occur. 
        Primarily, this means a slight change in the way that professors advertise 
        film showings.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;What we have done that is new is to try to say that when faculty 
        are going to be showing films and videos, and they list these films on 
        the website, they have to include a disclamer saying that the showings 
        are only open to the students in the class,&quot; DeGraff said. The stricter 
        policy will also effect Bowdoin College publications such as the Bowdoin 
        Orient and the Bowdoin Sun. &quot;They are also not allowed to announce 
        the showings places targeting a wider audience that are not within copyright 
        laws.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, there is nothing terribly new about the law. &quot;It shouldn't 
        affect the way that faculty use films and videos in their teaching. What 
        changes very slightly is that we are going to be a little more vigilant 
        about making sure that only the students taking classes view the films 
        being shown&quot; DeGraff said. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The new college policy was implemented as companies that own films have 
        open access to the websites that more and more professors are creating. 
        If it seems that the professor is opening the film viewings to a wider 
        audience and violating the copyright law, the company has the right to 
        call the institution in violation and demand that fees be paid.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Furthermore, the stricter policy may have some effect on more informal 
        student film showings. Degraff said &quot;more informally, when student 
        groups are showing films and videos, there have probably been instances 
        where they have not gone through the process required to attain proper 
        rights to the movie being shown.&quot; </p>
