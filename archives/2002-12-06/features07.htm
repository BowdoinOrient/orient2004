      <p align="left">The summer of 1939 was one of travel for Bowdoin students 
        and faculty alike. Onboard the exploration vessel <i>Bowdoin</i> with 
        famed alumnus Donald B. MacMillan (Class of 1897) were C. Eugene Woodward, 
        Jr. '42 and William Deacon '43. Both had the opportunity to see the arctic 
        explorer in action as they set sail from Boothbay Harbor on June 24, stopped 
        in Labrador, where MacMillan had founded a school for Eskimos, dropped 
        off supplies and then swung up towards Greenland. Across the chilly arctic 
        sea the <i>Bowdoin</i> sailed, her bow cutting the dark blue water as 
        it drifted towards unknown horizons. As the water pealed across the mighty 
        vessel there was peace in the silent air. Nothing but the invisible breeze 
        and the surfacing of whales broke the calm that was so peaceful and inspiring. 
        The Bowdoin students helped the crew of 15, saw plenty of wildlife, and 
        ate large amounts of cod and sea trout. Woodward, feeling adventurous 
        or perhaps just sick of fish ventured to try seal liver, which he pronounced, 
        &quot;not bad&quot; before the <i>Bowdoin</i> returned to port on September 
        9.</p>
      <p align="left">While these Bowdoin men were off in the wintry waters of 
        Greenland, a lot had happened in the world and many Bowdoin community 
        members were on hand to witness it. Professor of Romance Languages Charles 
        H. Livingston was in France that summer, attempting to hire a new member 
        for the French Department, while in London Professor of History, Nathaniel 
        C. Kendrick was finishing up some research. On the other side of the globe 
        a Bowdoin member of the Class of 1942, Joseph Sears Platt, saw first hand 
        the effects of war that fateful summer. Sailing from San Francisco to 
        the Philippines and then onwards to China, Platt landed in a war-torn 
        country. The Japanese armed forces had been systematically destroying 
        the Chinese countryside. Making his way to Shanghai Platt found the city 
        overcrowded with penniless and hungry refugees who were willing to work 
        for almost price. Desperation could be seen clearly on the faces of the 
        men, women, and children who were caught in a war-zone. The Rape of Nanking 
        had already occurred and the Japanese continued to hammer at the Chinese 
        homeland, getting ever closer to a war with the Great Britain and the 
        United States itself. From Shanghai Platt traveled to Ceylon then to Capetown 
        and then back to Boston. On these ships that sailed the suddenly unsafe 
        seas there were precautions taken against attack. Lifeboats were swung 
        over the sides at all times as practice drills and blackouts kept the 
        passengers on edge. Platt's round-the-world trip ended as he returned 
        safely to the campus that fall.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were two members of the Bowdoin community who were on hand to witness 
        the actual outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. Everett Parker 
        Pope '41, who had all but mastered the French language was looking forward 
        to his year of studying abroad. Pope had been industrious and sought out 
        a study-away program himself-the College having not aided in this endeavor 
        as studying abroad was a rarity. Arriving in Europe by a French liner, 
        Pope and members of this study away group made their way to Paris where, 
        as the he remembered, &quot;the fires had begun to burn.&quot; All along 
        the streets of Paris there were recruiting posters and great patriotic 
        themes. At night there were practice blackouts and drills, preparing for 
        invasion. Along Paris' main avenues there were regiments of French soldiers 
        parading with their crisp uniforms and proud flags fluttering in the wind. 
        Many had been alive during the days of the Great War and yet they still 
        marched forth with an air as if theirs was a civilization that could never 
        be dealt the deadly blow. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On September 1, 1939, despite threats of a war with France and Great Britain, 
        German troops crossed the border into Poland and began their Blitzkrieg. 
        A day later Britain and France declared war on Germany. &quot;At that 
        point any possible conception that I would spend my junior year in Paris 
        was gone,&quot; Pope remembered. Still, the Bowdoin junior felt no concern 
        for his personal safety. He and the other members of his study away group 
        were being taken care of by the United States Embassy. Relocated out of 
        harms way, the American students waited for a neutral ship to transport 
        them home, French vessels being too dangerous with Hitler's U-boats patrolling 
        the Atlantic crossings. Pope and his comrades were sent to the town of 
        Nantes, where they watched young men, not much older than they were, disembark 
        and march towards the fighting. These were the legions of the British 
        Expeditionary Force (BEF), crossing the Channel to help defend democracy 
        and freedom. They had cheerful smiles and hidden demons. Fear and uncertainty 
        were etched into their faces as they marched into this, a war they had 
        not wanted. &quot;They had no idea of their future,&quot; Pope remembered, 
        &quot;nor I of mine.&quot; From Nantes the group traveled to Bordeaux 
        where classes attempted to keep going and keep the students busy. This, 
        however, did not work well. Air raid sirens and black outs thrilled the 
        youngsters who were in the midst of a mobilizing nation. Not long afterwards, 
        their time to leave France arrived as the U.S.S. Manhattan docked at Bordeaux 
        and welcomed its American citizens aboard. Among the members of the crew 
        were Mormon missionaries, Rhodes Scholars from England, the U.S. track 
        and field team, and the dance troupe the Rockettes. The seven-day return 
        journey, Pope remembers as being uneventful.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Another member of the Bowdoin community was also stranded in Europe when 
        war was declared. Katrina Nixon, daughter of the Dean of the College, 
        who had been studying at the University of London had to wait several 
        weeks before she was able to secure passage on the liner Washington. Even 
        then the trip was hazardous. There were black outs every night and the 
        anxious passengers prayed that they would not come across the path of 
        a hunting U-boat. Rooms that were meant for one or two passengers were 
        crowded with up to six and even the pool was used as sleeping quarters 
        by some, including the famed actor and filmmaker Robert Montgomery. Katrina 
        Nixon recalled how smoking was banned on the Washington at night but this 
        rule was frequently broken by the author Thomas Mann and his wife! After 
        an uneventful voyage the Washington was once again home and Katrina Nixon 
        could return to campus where the 138th academic year was already in season.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At his opening Chapel to welcome the new Class of 1943-the unfortunate 
        class who would have their college careers disrupted by the largest war 
        in human history-Kenneth Sills spoke of history and responsibility:</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the College begins today, its annual tasks for the one hundred and 
        thirty-eighth time you do not need to be told that for the world and for 
        this country the days are as critical as in 1815, 1861, and 1914, years 
        that marked the Napoleonic, Civil and World Wars. You will soon find that 
        the war going on in Europe will affect you directly or indirectly every 
        day of this term. &#133; the future is dark with threats, this is no time 
        to be complacent or indifferent, least of all is it a time to think of 
        the College in terms of a country club. It is, in a scriptural phrase, 
        a time to be sober and to be vigilant; it is a time to avoid fear and 
        hysteria; it is a time to shut one's ears to rumor and propaganda. &#133; 
        And in the words I used to Bowdoin students departing from this quiet 
        campus to take part in the World War in 1918, this is above all a time 
        to guard the citadel of one's own soul and let no defeat occur there. 
        &#133; to assert that our only duty is to keep America out of war is shortsighted 
        and selfish. &#133; with all these preparations made for the coming year 
        the warning signals are set and we can go about our tasks calmly and happily 
        but never for a moment forgetting our brethren in other parts of the world 
        who are being called upon every day to give up all that they hold dear 
        because they seem to have been caught in a fatal situation from which 
        there is no escape but through war and bitterness and strife. May God 
        save us from such a fate, but save us too from being complacent and selfish 
        and negligent.</p>
      <p>These &quot;brethren&quot; that President Sills noted in his address 
        included a certain Arthur Mills Stratton of the Class of 1935. A writer 
        and traveler, Stratton served with the American Volunteer Ambulance Corps 
        and aided French forces near the town of Rouhling in Lorraine beginning 
        his services at the end of 1938. A member of Chi Psi and a former writer 
        for the Quill and the Orient, Stratton was in the midst of writing in 
        France when the blow finally fell on May 10, 1940. Following a period 
        known to history as the Phoney War-in which no actual fighting was going 
        on in Europe, a menacing sight appeared on the borders of France, Belgium 
        and the Netherlands. One hundred and eighteen infantry divisions supported 
        by sixteen armored or motorized divisions and over three thousand planes 
        of the German army began their invasion of Western Europe. Altogether 
        two and one half million soldiers were unleashed under command of the 
        F&uuml;hrer. The governments of Belgium and Holland, having refused to 
        cooperate with the Allies-declaring themselves staunch neutrals-were quickly 
        overrun. German panzer divisions, neatly arranged in battle formation 
        were used to run over obstacles and pave the way for the infantry. Used 
        in concentrated units and supported by the fighting engines of the Luftwaffe, 
        the German juggernaut was not easy to contain. Desperate fighting raged 
        all over Western Europe as the Allies attempted to shore up their lines, 
        protect their flanks and counterstrike. Nothing, however, seemed to halt 
        the advancing tide that had been kept down for so long. In the Netherlands 
        German paratroopers dropped from the skies and caused havoc as infantry 
        advanced against the ill-fated Dutch defenders. When Allied troops responded 
        to the rush of German troops in Belgium and the Dutch homelands they found 
        that little was left. The Luftwaffe, patrolling the skies with no equal 
        destroyed all that it could in the opening days of the offensive. Allied 
        forces were no match and the British Expeditionary Force-perhaps even 
        those whom Everett Pope had seen disembarking in Nantes-was forced into 
        its legendary withdrawal from Dunkirk. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On June 5, 1940 a new Germany offensive against the French line on the 
        Somme came with over one hundred fresh divisions. Here the panzer groups 
        proved themselves again as they ran over Allied defensive positions, rounded 
        up thousands of prisoners and conquered the lands they had gained once 
        before in the First World War. Paris fell on June 14 and by the 25th the 
        French had been defeated. Resistance would continue throughout the war 
        but for now it was all that stood in the way of the Third Reich was the 
        defiant stance of Great Britain and her bold prime minister, Winston Spencer 
        Churchill.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Among the men who were now German prisoners of war was Bowdoin graduate 
        Arthur Stratton, who had recently, had the honor of becoming the first 
        American to receive the Croix de guerre from the French government in 
        the Second World War. Placed in a prison camp for almost a month Stratton 
        came across a German citizen who assured him that the Third Reich would 
        rule the world and that the British Empire would fall soon enough. Hardened 
        by these words and by what he had seen, Stratton spoke out about how the 
        U.S. should step into the conflict, after he was released from prison 
        camp and sent home. Returning to Maine, Stratton told his fellow Americans, 
        &quot;we are up against the black ages.&quot; &quot;England guards our 
        Atlantic coast and protects us,&quot; the Bowdoin graduated continued, 
        &quot;if England's navy falls, we have no way to protect South America, 
        we would have no way of keeping Hitler from accomplishing his desires. 
        For purely selfish reasons we should be actively in the war.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In Brunswick the spirit of house parties that winter was somewhat dampened 
        by the knowledge that thousands were fighting and dying across the Atlantic 
        and that the United States might soon be forced into the conflict, as 
        she had been in the first global war. This was the same winter that Life 
        magazine sent a photographer to chronicle Bowdoin's parties. Over two 
        hundred photographs were taken, although only a handful were used in the 
        actual magazine. The cover did, however, feature a Bowdoin junior by the 
        name of Ernest Harold Pottle, Jr. with his date. The Orient noted that 
        sales of Life soured in the community and joked that Pottle &quot;has 
        gotten several sweetly scented, wishy-washy fan letters, notes from long 
        forgotten friends and innumerable criticisms of his inexpert horsemanship 
        as shown by his rein-holding.&quot; Aside from this mid-academic year 
        excitement on campus events followed their usual pattern. There were activities, 
        parties, traditions to be fulfilled and elections. All this, however, 
        seemed inconsequential to many. With one eye on their work and another 
        on the situation in Europe the men of Bowdoin College finished the school 
        year still feeling uneasy and uncertain about the future.</p>
