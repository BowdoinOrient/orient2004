        <font size="2">ACADIA SENESE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> We had uninvited guests at our Thanksgiving dinner. They 
        just showed up, made themselves at home, helped themselves to the food 
        in the kitchen cabinet, and nestled their way right into our living room. 
        I don't mind that we had extra visitors for dinner; it made the conversation 
        lively and added some energy and pizzazz to the day that my aging relatives 
        no longer bring. </p>
      <p>Albeit, these visitors weren't of the human kind; in fact, they weren't 
        even primates. They were mice. Lots of cute, little, dark gray field mice. 
        They had big ears, inquiring eyes, and the cutest little noses you ever 
        did see. There was only one problem: they were in the house. And well, 
        mice belong outside the house.</p>
      <p>So, my brother and I, in a valiant effort, attempted to capture the mice-alive, 
        mind you-and return them to the wilderness that is our back yard. But 
        herein is another problem: mice are clever creatures; the quickest, smartest 
        little beggars you've ever hunted. My brother and I cornered one little 
        Fieval Mousquawitz in our kitchen, and having emptied the entire pantry 
        of all the food, had little Fieval backed against a corner. My brother-gloves 
        on hands, ready to pounce-and I, with a makeshift shoebox ready to capture-readied 
        ourselves for the moment of truth. We inched our ways forward, stared 
        directly at the mouse (our hearts were pounding with the fear that the 
        mouse might actually leap at us) and attempted to cover him with the shoebox. 
        But when I say mice are the most clever creatures, I'm not lying. This 
        mouse was more like Evil Knieval than Fieval. He twisted and turned and 
        poofed his way out of our trap. We saw our valiant attempt fail as Fieval 
        Knieval scurried his way down to the laundry room.</p>
      <p>Now enters my father. He says he's going to do &quot;things right&quot;and 
        capture the mouse. Unlike my brother and I, he was getting the mouse dead 
        or alive. So he locked himself in the laundry room with the mouse, and 
        declared that he wasn't coming out until he got the mouse. Man against 
        mouse, my father went at it in the laundry room. And let me tell you, 
        noise came from that room like you've never heard before. On one hand, 
        driers were banging and washer-machines rattling, and on the other hand 
        a slew of expletives were hurling. And despite it all, out comes the little 
        mouse from underneath the door jam-inching, and I swear, laughing-his 
        way down to our family room.</p>
      <p>My father, defeated, embarrassed, and utterly pissed off, has now made 
        it his personal mission to catch Fieval Knieval. With the mouse now secured 
        in our family room, he storms off to the hardware store to get himself 
        &quot;some real mousetraps.&quot; I tagged along-mostly because I wanted 
        to make sure he got the 'live catch' mousetraps-and into the hardware 
        store we went. You wouldn't believe the assortment of mousetraps available 
        until you go and buy them. I thought that they just had the little wooden 
        ones, but now they have sticky paper, and what I like to call the &quot;Terminator 
        Traps.&quot; These traps are metal, and would probably kill a small dog, 
        let alone a mouse, if triggered. I argued for the &quot;live catch&quot; 
        traps, made by the French (the French don't have the death penalty, why 
        should they kill their mice?), but my Dad was all business and went right 
        for the Traps of Death.</p>
      <p>And so, this mouse story comes to an unfortunate end. You see, for all 
        their quickness, their cleverness, and their cuteness, the mice have a 
        vice, and it's not cheese, it's peanut butter. And so, Fieval Knieval 
        didn't go for the turkey on Thanksgiving Day, he went for the Skippy, 
        and well, &quot;Terminator Traps&quot; don't have much mercy for even 
        the most talented of mice.<br>
