        <font size="2">MACAELA FLANAGAN</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Whether it's a cameo, guest appearance, or a full-blown 
        lead role, many musicians have veered from the studios to the silver screen 
        and vice versa. The reasons for these journeys vary by artist; some are 
        actually talented in both fields (think Madonna and Mos Def), many have 
        the ability to make huge box office or arena concert revenues, and some 
        are just pressing their luck. Many of the people swimming between the 
        screen and the stage should probably just be anchored at the bottom, but 
        pop culture is not always an intelligent entity. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The trend of rock stars making movies is not something unique to our day 
        and age. The 1950s were a time of musical revolution, both artistically 
        and economically. Elvis exploded onto the rock scene and the silver screen 
        with Love Me Tender in 1956 and Jailhouse Rock in 1957. Despite the fact 
        that nowadays he is an object of obsession for the 55-plus crowd who religiously 
        make pilgrimages to Graceland each year, the guy was insanely popular 
        in his day.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The four British boys also got their turn to use film in order to appendage 
        their musical success. For every screaming, sobbing teenage girl that 
        wanted to see the Beatles in concert there was a wallet willing to dispense 
        its contents for a glimpse. They quit the touring fad in '66, but their 
        fans' incurable obsession was perhaps eased slightly by viewing the boys 
        plastered on a movie screen.</p>
      <p align="left">
        These films have become a sort of cult favorite, but they aren't exactly 
        Citizen Kane. In other words, they might be fun, but their success is 
        pretty much based on the status of their rock icon lead characters. The 
        few Beatles and Elvis movies I have seen were definitely entertaining, 
        but let's just say I don't think Ringo was nominated for any Oscars.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Modern times bring in a whole slew of actors hoping to own both sides 
        of the superstardom line. Jennifer Lopez might be one of the busiest people 
        in the entertainment biz; she frequents both the airwaves and the screens. 
        Lucky, lucky us. Out of Sight wasn't exactly that, but it sure beats out 
        The Wedding Planner and the unfortunate Bowdoin party fave &quot;I'm Real.&quot; 
        I can't say that I am anything close to a fan, but she certainly has managed 
        to make a place for herself. Forget the first name basis intimacy of Madonna; 
        J.Lo's got initials-and her own clothing line. And her own signature perfume. 
        And an advertising shtick that shows her in the nude. How's that for an 
        overdose?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Eminem is now starring in 8 Mile. Granted his face is plastered on Rolling 
        Stone and his bad-boy popularity was spurred by his battles with the F.C.C., 
        but regardless the film can stand on its own. Despite the clich&eacute;s 
        and unsurprising plot twists that weaken parts of the film, the acting 
        is solid. Even without Eminem's status as a popular music figure, I imagine 
        8 Mile would still enjoy the benefit of many teenagers' movie budget and 
        do decently at the box office&#133;but probably not as decently.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The guest appearance of a musician in a film, while not a full blown attempt 
        at dual stardom, can certainly enhance a film's appeal when used correctly. 
        Let's examine the movie career of Alice Cooper. Nightmare on Elm Street 
        6 and Wayne's World were both blessed with his presence. Without his concert 
        scene in WW, there would be no reason for Benjamin to ship Wayne and Garth 
        to Milwaukee while he attempts to seduce Cassandra. Therefore, not only 
        is his role central to this complex plot, but he plays himself and as 
        viewers we're privileged to see both his musical abilities and his knowledge 
        of Milwaukee's political past. Guest performances are good: they quench 
        the thirst, but do not require a binge. </p>

        No article on pop figures crossing boundaries is complete with a discussion 
        of Marky Mark. If you are a new fan, you may know this talent by his screen 
        name: Mark Wahlberg. But to us children of the early 90s, The Funky Bunch 
        and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; will forever be engrained in our late 
        elementary school memories. Maybe the music is dated but the film career 
        isn't. Who cares if they don't exist simultaneously? The point is that 
        Marky-Mark made his mark in both mediums. Boogie Nights is a modern classic 
        and The Perfect Storm was one of the most popular films of 2000.</p>
      <p align="left">
        And who says you can't be a white rapper turned movie star? Oh yeah. I 
        think it was Vanilla Ice.</p>
