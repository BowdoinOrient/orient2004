      <p align="left">November 25, Bowdoin students united as the Coalition to 
        Raise Awareness About the War in Iraq staged a demonstration aimed to 
        spark debate concerning the recent rise in American military presence 
        in the Middle East. The event attracted a diverse audience that included 
        strong representation from members of Bowdoin's faculty and student body, 
        as well as Brunswick residents, reflecting the wide range of groups and 
        speakers participating in the presentation. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Various on-campus groups hosted tables ringing the edges of Morrell Lounge. 
        In addition, Bowdoin's own World Music Ensemble opened for a large crowd 
        that swelled over two hundred at points. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After opening remarks from Coalition member Vinay Kashyap '05, Bowdoin 
        Women's Studies Professor Kristen Ghodsee roused the crowd with a passionate 
        antiwar speech. She drew upon personal experience and travels in Iraq 
        previous to the Gulf War and outlined her own reasons to oppose American 
        military action. She cited biased, inflammatory American government and 
        media propaganda as particularly galling. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's easy to hibernate in our own little bubbles and ignore what's 
        going on in the rest of the world&#133;what is the ideology of terrorism? 
        Or is this just another ghost&#133;like the ghost of Communism?&quot; 
        She said, &quot;I think we just need a new enemy.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though impressed with the large turnout, Ghodsee challenged the audience 
        to greater action. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;How can we protest the war and still be patriots?&quot; she asked, 
        &quot;If you want to stop the Bush government, hit them where it hurts: 
        in the economy&#133;If this protest is to be heard, it must be a protest 
        of the pocketbook.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Her attitude at points spawned noisy interruptions from certain members 
        of the audience. &quot;I think it's worthwhile to start a dialogue, throw 
        around ideas, make people feel better,&quot; offered Eric Bakkensen, '05. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's a pretty good leftist feel here,&quot; stated Sam Kapel, '05, 
        &quot;I'm not gonna say it'll be especially effective, but I wish them 
        well.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;How do you justify war? And who's the enemy?&quot; asked Walkens 
        Petit-Frere, '05, &quot;Basically I believe the U.S. is attacking [Iraq's] 
        values; by doing that, the enemy is defined. And that's unfortunate.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Miscellania, Bowdoin's all-female a capella group, followed Professor 
        Ghodsee and performed several antiwar pieces. The first was composed by 
        a Miscellania member in the early nineties and the second was a Vietnam 
        protest song. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The night continued with Arthur Whitman, Treasurer of the Maine Veterans 
        for Peace. A former professor at Robert College, an American school in 
        Istanbul, Turkey, Whitman quoted extensively from mission statements of 
        the organization and explained his own personal opposition to a military 
        solution to the troubles in Iraq. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;This is a worldwide ideological conflict between a tribal God who 
        plays favorites, (a God of vengeance demanding retribution as so many 
        seem to be doing) and a universal God of compassion and love of all mankind,&quot; 
        he asserted, &quot;You can decide for yourself which God you are following.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The event continued with Professor of Sociology, Joe Bandi. Painting the 
        proposed military action as a &quot;short-sighted war for oil&quot; and 
        &quot;reassertion of empire&quot; with wide-ranging consequences for the 
        environment, he emphasized the inconsistency of selective American foreign 
        policy positions. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;If we were serious about dealing with nations or states [with the 
        capacity to] use weapons of mass destruction, we might focus on many countries. 
        We might focus on North Korea. We might focus on Saudi Arabia. We might 
        focus on Israel. We might focus on ourselves,&quot; he said. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We look more and more like the terrorists we despise,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;We need to dream of what we might want. We need to envision a new 
        world and then shout it from the rooftops. I want you to graduate with 
        a critical mind and begin to apply that to your lives.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bandi was followed by a well-received performance by Bowdoin Poeting and 
        remarks of Economics Professor Dorothea Herreiner. The Coalition thanked 
        all participants and attendants and encouraged further consideration and 
        contemplation of the issues surrounding the situation in Iraq. As the 
        event ended, lively political discussion broke out in small groups in 
        Morrell Lounge and throughout the Union. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We must focus beyond the immediate effects,&quot; said Bowdoin student 
        Melissa Hudson '05, &quot;We must ask ourselves, as the leading world 
        power, what will our actions dictate to the rest of the world? What do 
        we say to those who watch us about what is reasonable and what is just?&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kashyap and Lauren Pappone '03, commented on the success of the Coalition 
        and the night's demonstrations. With another one of Bowdoin's a capella 
        groups, BOCA, performing in the background, they noted the large audience 
        and spoke of their group's future plans. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We wanted to use this event as a starting point to begin circulating 
        ideas in people's heads,&quot; said Kashyap, &quot;we do plan to follow 
        up with different events. When it comes to war, real debate seems to be 
        lacking in both parties and in the halls of Washington. It resembles the 
        disaster in Vietnam. We feel times have changed. If our elected politicians 
        aren't going to do their duties as citizens, someone has to. That's what 
        our nation was founded on, right? Public participation. Debate.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The group is planning further action, including a trip to Washington, 
        D.C. at the end of Winter Break. </p>
