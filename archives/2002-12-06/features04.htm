      <p align="left">Boss, Eb, Big Ben, Simone and Foxy all really want to be 
        your friend. Yes, they all live at 30 Range Road in Brunswick and invite 
        you to come play, whether it's taking a walk on the forested trails next 
        to their temporary home, or training them to sit, stay or come, upon request. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Anyone who misses his or her pet or loves animals is highly encouraged 
        to volunteer at the Coastal Humane Society. CHS is a friendly animal shelter 
        in Brunswick that invites any Bowdoin student interested in volunteering 
        to work with animals. Volunteers have the option to work with several 
        types of animals. Some volunteers even have allergies to certain animals, 
        but have no problem working with others in different areas of the shelter.</p>
      <p align="left">
        True, many people's notion of a &quot;pound&quot; consists of a sad, dirty, 
        gloomy and overall depressing place with small cages for stray dogs and 
        cats that are behaviorally unstable with workers who have personalities 
        that are more boring than Keanu Reeves and who are as displeasing to look 
        at as Steve Buscemi in Fargo.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This is not the case with CHS. It is nothing like a &quot;pound,&quot; 
        but rather a friendly, welcoming and clean environment where the personable 
        staff members are appreciative of your volunteered efforts. Volunteers 
        will not work with sick animals-only healthy ones (in a separate building), 
        both mentally and physically, that have received all necessary shots and 
        have been bathed recently. </p>
      <p align="left">
        CHS runs 365 days a year offering humane education and animal welfare 
        programs, animal care and training classes, as well as pet therapy visits 
        to hospitals and nursing homes. They facilitate responsible adoptions, 
        foster care for pregnant, injured, ill, stray, abandoned or abused animals 
        and the return of lost pets to their owners. The shelter never euthanizes 
        for lack of space-it only does so when the most severe behavioral or medical 
        conditions make it necessary.</p>
      <p align="left">
        CHS offers 24-hour service to 14 towns and their control officers whose 
        unfortunate duty is to bring in the region's lost, mistreated, or feral 
        cats and dogs. Contract money is the only &quot;guaranteed&quot; income, 
        and it constitutes only one-fifth of the annual budget. Overall, the shelter 
        serves approximately 2,500 animals each year at a cost that exceeds $375,000 
        annually. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Former Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Sharon Turner serves as the Executive 
        Director of CHS. &quot;We always welcome Bowdoin students to volunteer 
        at the shelter and would love to see more come out in the future months,&quot; 
        said Turner. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In case you're busy, lazy or just plain don't want to head down to the 
        shelter, CHS would tremendously appreciate any monetary contribution (great 
        gifts when sent in the name of a friend or family member), which can be 
        made out to The Coastal Humane Society, 30 Grange Road, Brunswick, ME 
        04011. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Friends of the Coastal Humane Society will be selling Teddy packs (microwavable 
        and freezable packs for sore muscles) at their &quot;Sunsplash Booth&quot; 
        in Smith Union on December 12. In addition, on December 15 the shelter 
        will run an open house with a silent auction and refreshments. &quot;Items 
        in the auction will include antiques, art and certificates-all great gift 
        ideas for Bowdoin students,&quot; said Turner. Proceeds for both events 
        will go to CHS.</p>
      <p align="left">
        To get to the shelter from campus if walking or biking, head down Main 
        Street into town, turn left at Pleasant and head down a few miles, past 
        McDonald's. Then, turn right on Range Road /Animal Shelter Road, go several 
        hundred yards, and the shelter is on the right. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you have a chance, even if it's just for an hour, during reading period 
        or anytime Monday through Saturday 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., feel free 
        to volunteer because, as Darwin said, &quot;The love for all living creatures 
        is the noblest attribute of a man.&quot;</p>
