      <p align="left"> My father says I am a rebel without a cause, because I 
        believe in change. I am very cynical about change, but I believe in it. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        At the program on Iraq before Thanksgiving, Professor Ghodsee suggested 
        that change could begin if we stopped shopping. And people laughed. Is 
        the idea so ridiculous?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Consuming is the great American pastime; it's even more than that-it's 
        the American religion. And it feeds off of fear-fear that we don't have 
        as much as the next person, fear that we don't look the way we're supposed 
        to, fear that our appearance, our material goods, are an indication of 
        our worth. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But we like shopping. We like consuming. We apparently like walking into 
        stores so that we can feel completely inadequate viewing all the things 
        we don't have and then wanting them. Shopping is about perpetuating fears 
        and wants. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And we have been obsessed over the past year with fear, with the threatening 
        world of which we are terrified. But we do it to ourselves every day. 
        We are a culture of fear, obsessed with appearances, obsessed with expectations 
        and what we are supposed to do. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This is a free country in which we scare each other out of the exercise 
        of that freedom. And for what? So that we can perpetually be stressed 
        about what we have or don't have, what we look like, what we're eating, 
        what image we are perpetuating. </p>
      <p align="left">
        My father told me that I have no cause, because I want to change a mindset 
        that people are quite happy with-one that is comfortable. And, I wonder, 
        how comfortable is fear? How comfortable is it to judge and fear other 
        people on the basis of superficial qualities like appearance and possessions? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Consumer culture is not just about our recreational shopping habits; it 
        is about buying into ideas, consuming a mindset that may not even be our 
        own. It's about intellectual and cultural hegemony-ceasing to recognize 
        expectations and constructed roles as what they are, and believing instead 
        that they are all there is. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I went home for Thanksgiving break with blue hair, and I was told that 
        something is wrong with me. Something is wrong with me because I am not 
        willing to buy into certain stereotypes and expectations. Something is 
        wrong with m, because I will not allow myself to live a life based in 
        fear. Something is wrong with me because I believe in change. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And I believe in change because the alternative is bleak. I believe in 
        change because there is nothing else in which to believe, except fear. 
        In his poem &quot;A Sword In A Cloud of Light,&quot; Kenneth Rexroth writes: 
        &quot;It would do/ No good to say this and it/ May do no good to write 
        it./ Believe in Orion. Believe/ In the night, the moon, the crowded/ Earth. 
        Believe in Christmas and/ Birthdays and Easter rabbits./ Believe in all 
        those fugitive/ Compounds of nature, all doomed/ To waste away and go 
        out./ Always be true to these things./ They are all there is. Never/ Give 
        up this savage religion/ For the blood-drenched civilized/ Abstractions 
        of the rascals/ Who live by killing you and me.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        It may do no good to write this either, but writing and language is how 
        I believe in change, so I will write it. Change is about value and meaning. 
        How can we not believe in it?</p>
