        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Autumn is a time for love. A time for romance. Frankly, 
        I'm at my most passionate between September and December. As the leaves 
        fall, as the light wanes, as the temperature drops, I'm all about the 
        love. Girls come and go, but college football is always there. </p>
      <p align="left">
        My first game was in the womb, the autumn before I came to be. Just a 
        couple months later, I was born in Ann Arbor, a few miles from Michigan 
        Stadium. At six, I sat in the south end zone and watched the Wolverines 
        smoke Minnesota's Golden Gophers. Simply put, I've been steeped in college 
        football. </p>
      <p align="left">
        That said, the last weeks have been tough, as the University of Michigan 
        ended their season with a tight loss to the Ohio State's Buckeyes; a game 
        the Maize and Blue dominated and should've taken. Until you've seen one 
        of these games for yourself, you simply can't understand the intertwined 
        passions. These are two of the nation's most storied teams - a contention 
        that stats bear out. </p>
      <p align="left">
        According to the NCAA, Michigan's program is 121 years old, while Ohio 
        State's is a sprightly 111 years young. Michigan has the second-best all-time 
        winning percentage amongst all schools and the most overall victories, 
        while Ohio State ranks fifth and seventh, respectively. The University 
        of Michigan boasts the nation's largest football stadium on all levels 
        with an official capacity of 107,501 and routinely sets a new attendance 
        record during each year's Ohio State game. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The rivalry is 97 years old, with Michigan leading 56-36-6. These two 
        teams are the class of the Big Ten; a fan poll conducted by the NCAA last 
        week showed that nearly 32 percent of fans believe that the Big Ten is 
        the nation's strongest football conference, with no other conference within 
        5 percentage points. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It's a huge game, casting a shadow over the rest of the season. Almost 
        every year, one or both of the two teams are contending for the Big Ten's 
        Rose Bowl berth or the national championship. </p>
      <p align="left">
        What am I getting at? The last Orient before Thanksgiving contended that 
        there was no reason to watch Division I football because the Bowl Championship 
        Series takes away from the excitement by focusing on exceedingly complex 
        and excessive calculations to determine a champion. Granted, I've got 
        my own problems with the BCS, namely that it plunders the Rose Bowl once 
        every four years for two teams that are not necessarily from the Pac-10 
        or Big Ten. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Still, that's a separate issue. The ranking system is not necessarily 
        the most desirable means of deciding a national champion, but it has little 
        to no bearing on the quality of D-I football. Maybe the author has been 
        watching the wrong football? </p>
      <p align="left">
        That is possible because the game has become a sectional affair. I'd contend 
        that the SEC is not a &quot;football&quot; conference, or at least that 
        it represents a diminished version. The West Coast offense is not football, 
        either. Football is not played underneath a roof. Nor is it played on 
        anything other than grass-real grass. </p>
      <p align="left">
        That's what makes the Big Ten so great, what makes the Big Twelve so strong. 
        These are conferences where the game is about defense, about the ground 
        game, and the changing seasons. The game has changed for some. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The appeal of college football isn't necessarily in the final score or 
        outcome; it's in the game itself. I don't care one whit about the .01 
        that the Buckeyes needed to gain to overtake Miami for first place. It'll 
        take far more than a nerdy rankings formula to kill my devotion. God I 
        love football. Heads up for January 1st and the Rose Bowl! </p>
