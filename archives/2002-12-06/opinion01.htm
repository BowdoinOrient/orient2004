        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> All students received a World AIDS day pamphlet earlier 
        this week. This pamphlet advocated &quot;medically accurate, and comprehensive 
        sexual education.&quot; This is an appropriate statement encouraging students 
        who are sexually active to do so safely. However, there was more to the 
        pamphlet than simply paper. There was a &quot;raspberry flavored&quot; 
        prophylactic. </p>
      <p>The act of uniform condom distribution offends a number of students. 
        Though there is no need to proscribe the practice, the campus should realize 
        that there are a number of reasons why one might be offended upon finding 
        a condom in one's mailbox and it might be prudent for the group who distributed 
        the condoms to find a less offensive way of promoting its message.<br>
        <br>
        An obvious reason for offense is religious belief. Most religions treat 
        sex in a sacrosanct fashion. However, it is not only the most fundamentalist 
        practitioners of a particular faith who might take offense upon reception 
        of a condom. There are some who for other reasons disapprove of seeing 
        flavored sexual instruments dispensed in their mailbox</p>
      <p>One friend of mine, who is not particularly religious, said that he was 
        offended by the flavoring of the condom. He felt that having a condom 
        with a taste presented sex in a &quot;fun and playful nature.&quot; This 
        decision and that phrasing seriously offended this student's sensitivities. 
      </p>
      <p>His sensitivities or others of that nature do not necessarily have to 
        be religiously or morally based. It is a fact that if people had less 
        sex, then there would be fewer STDs and unwanted pregnancies in our society. 
        This would likely mean fewer single mothers, fewer people on welfare, 
        and perhaps less crime, but this is a topic for another article. </p>
      <p>More to the point, someone who genuinely believes that sex should be 
        discouraged for these social reasons might be seriously offended to see 
        the seriousness of sexual acts downplayed by a flavored condom. </p>
      <p>Some students and members of our community have what one could characterize 
        as a traditional sense of decency and politeness. For example, I have 
        never been comfortable talking explicitly about sex because I remember 
        being told as a child that there were certain words one didn't say &quot;in 
        public.&quot; This is one of the few statements from my generally liberal 
        parents that I embraced unquestioningly. </p>
      <p>More practically speaking, raspberry flavored condoms, signs that discuss 
        vibrators and vaginas, or sidewalk chalk that says &quot;real men take 
        it up the butt&quot; makes me and I know many other people on this campus 
        extremely uncomfortable. </p>
      <p>Though these items are offensive to me and many other students and community 
        members, I do not think our college should be in the business of censoring 
        student organizations. Just as a group wants to distribute condoms to 
        promote World AIDS day and can do so using Bowdoin student mailboxes, 
        so also may the Bowdoin Christian Fellowship distribute pocket-sized bibles 
        in student mailboxes. </p>
      <p>The question then returns to prudence. Is it wise for a group to attempt 
        to enflame the passions of the community? Might angering people detract 
        from the meaningful message that a group wants to advance? </p>
      <p>In the case of the condoms, the group who placed them in mailboxes probably 
        only wanted to educate and not arouse fury. However, some members of our 
        community were offended to receive a condom in their mailboxes. It might 
        be a better method of communication for this student group merely to use 
        the same pamphlet sans prophylactic and inform those who wish to engage 
        in sexual relations that protective devices can be found in the Health 
        Center. </p>
      <p>This would allow the group to propagate its message and remain respectful 
        to varying beliefs on sex. It would also allow students to focus more 
        on the perilous condition of our world vis-a-vis AIDS and the need for 
        &quot;medically accurate sexual education&quot; rather than the &quot;fun 
        and playful&quot; possibilities of raspberry-flavored latex.<br>
