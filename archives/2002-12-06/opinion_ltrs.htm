      <p align="left"><font size="5">Drop the slogan and skip a week</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>What would happen if the <i>Orient</i> didn't publish for one week? It 
        claims to be &quot;the oldest continuously published college weekly in 
        the United States,&quot; but does anyone really care? I don't. And I have 
        a feeling that most people agree with me. The right to proclaim that meaningless 
        statement has turned the <i>Orient</i> into a muck.</p>
      <p>Just look at some of the recent stories to find out what a waste of ink 
        simply printing those thousands of pages is. The issue from the week before 
        Thanksgiving had several provocative pieces. </p>
      <p>The lead story was that Bowdoin had selected a new campus planner to 
        lead us all into the future. Maybe the story should have been titled, 
        &quot;Bowdoin to suck last pennies from alums.&quot; I mean that's what 
        the idea behind the whole thing is. No one hires a planner to figure out 
        new ways to clean old floors. </p>
      <p>Right after that riveting piece, I found out that the college had installed 
        a defibrillator on campus for emergencies. The problem is that this happened 
        six months ago. The intentions are good. Everything else is flawed. First, 
        is this newsworthy? A column dedicated to a defibrillator? For this week 
        I just hope that this letter won't take space away from &quot;Using your 
        vacuum.&quot; </p>
      <p>Maybe it would be better if we left saving someone's life up to a professional, 
        and not to whomever happens to be closest to this mobile electric chair. 
        I just don't trust people who say even a sixth grader could use this instrument. 
        Sixth graders can't do many things, and even my roommate has electrocuted 
        himself in the past year. Leave the defibrillator with security, not in 
        the hands of teenagers. </p>
      <p>What wouldn't an <i>Orient</i> issue be if CIS didn't save the campus 
        from the next gigantic computer bug that has come to harvest our Dells? 
        I don't know anything about computers. No one can write anything good 
        about computers because a good computer story is an oxymoron. No one reads 
        their computer manuals when they want to kill some free time. </p>
      <p>Finally, stop giving everyone a weekly column. Why do you need such an 
        extensive staff? Stop giving space to students whose only job is to fill 
        it. If someone has something to say, let them say it. </p>
      <p>If I go to the dining hall on Friday afternoon, I want to read something 
        that is of interest to me. There's no point in reading something if you 
        don't care about what's its saying. I don't buy that garbage that it's 
        worth reading about to broaden my knowledge, my horizons. I'll broaden 
        my own horizons, you just focus on printing good material.</p>
      <p>Maybe the <i>Orient</i> should just take a week off? Give the writers 
        some time off so they can think of something to write about. Perhaps take 
        the money you save from publishing and buy an idea. People at least respect 
        the <i>Patriot</i> and the <i>Disorient</i> because they don't have to 
        deal with their garbage every week. I promise you, that skipping an issue 
        here or there will not prevent me from reading the following week-publishing 
        some of the recent rubbish will. </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Liberalizing the Democratic Party?</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I'm a Democrat and a liberal, but I read Reinert's article and was nothing 
        short of baffled. His point that Democrats need to be more liberal, seemingly 
        at the expense of logic, is ridiculous. First, let me address Reinert's 
        smaller points.</p>
      <p>For one, there is no &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of the nation 
        that is pro-choice. The number is more like 52 percent. As for the other 
        point, namely that Democrats would be more popular if they supported marijuana 
        legalization, Reinert simply has not done his research. There is a reason, 
        after all, that even Nevada decisively defeated a referendum to legalize 
        the drug. Most people, for better or for worse, do think marijuana should 
        stay illegal. Democrats should not seek to alienate most of the people 
        in the nation.</p>
      <p>Reinert makes other indefensible claims, such as saying &quot;censorship 
        is wrong in all cases.&quot; As &quot;evidence&quot; for this, he says 
        that he should be able to stand &quot;on a corner in D.C. and say he is 
        going to shoot the president.&quot; Never mind that the U.S. Supreme Court 
        has repeatedly interpreted the constitution as saying that speech that 
        poses an imminent danger is not protected. But does Reinert actually believe 
        this? More importantly, does anyone except for the most liberal one percent 
        of the nation actually agree with him? This is not a good issue for Democrats 
        to take a stand. </p>
      <p>As a Democrat, I would be appalled if the Democratic party moved in Reinert's 
        proposed direction. Reinert claims he'd be happy to &quot;fight a revolution.&quot; 
        But America doesn't like revolutionaries, Reinert. I only hope that the 
        Democratic Party is aware of this as well.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Neal Urwitz '06<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Security notification policy in the works</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors,</p>
      <p> I write to amend an editorial I submitted for the last issue of the 
        Orient in which I encouraged Security to inform students about parking 
        violations. After a discussion with Jason Hafler, President of Student 
        Affairs, and Colin LeCroy, Vice President for Facilities, I learned that 
        during the 2000-2001 school year Student Government instituted a system 
        similar to the one I proposed in my letter. </p>
      <p>As it stands, Security is supposed to submit to Student Government a 
        list of vehicles that have been towed, and Student Government is responsible 
        for notifying the offenders, by email, the same day. As of last week, 
        I was one of the many students who were previously unaware that such a 
        policy exists.</p>
      <p>In addition, Mr. LeCroy is working with CIS to build an automated notification 
        system into the ticketing system, so that not only are students notified 
        about tows, but also about tickets. Thus, the multiple ticket problem 
        I raised in my editorial would be eliminated.</p>
      <p>I apologize for any undue backlash that may have resulted from my editorial, 
        but hopefully this discourse has made more students aware of the service 
        that has been and will continue to be provided by Security and Student 
        Government.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="4"></a>BSG encourages student input</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>One of the best aspects of being a Bowdoin student is our ability to 
        get involved and be heard. In recent weeks, students have raised concerns 
        about parking, student organizations, and college committees through campus 
        publications. However, these same issues have not, by and large, been 
        presented to the BSG for our attention.</p>
      <p>The BSG is here for students with any concerns regarding the welfare 
        of&gt;the Bowdoin community. We charter student organizations, allocate 
        money for campus events, select student representatives to college committees, 
        and in general do our best to represent the interests of the student body. 
        While we are not always able to achieve all our goals, we act with the 
        intention of making Bowdoin a better place. We cannot do so alone, however. 
        If the BSG doesn't know what issues are important to you as students, 
        we obviously cannot do anything to alleviate your concerns.</p>
      <p>Communication is essential. We hope that all students will feel comfortable 
        raising issues with the elected student leadership through BSG. Students 
        should feel free to contact any member of BSG with their concerns. Bowdoin 
        is small enough that, with a little hard work and effort, change can be 
        affected in the way it is intended to. Let's see where we can go from 
        here.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Bowdoin Student Government<br>
