<h3>Maselli Marries Photography and Physics<br>
</h3>
<h5>AARON ROSEN &amp; LAURA NEWMAN<br>
  SENIOR AND A&amp;E EDITORS<br>
</h5>
<p>In her sophomore year at Bowdoin, Kate Maselli had the sort of epiphanic moment 
  that legitimizes a liberal arts education. All her classes &#147;seemed to come 
  together and relate to one another;&#148; in particular physics and photography. 
  An examination of optics in her physics course led her to understand the diverse 
  capabilities of her camera and spawned a sense of experimentalism evident in 
  her latest exhibition. Along with Adam Zimman &#145;02, Kate is currently showing 
  several of her photographs in the Bohemian Coffee House on Maine Street.<br>
  In the photo pictured at right, Kate experimented with the technique of time 
  lapse photography. She attempted several different exposure lengths before settling 
  upon this thirty second exposure. She was startled by the results, particularly 
  the way in which a static image could so potently express continuity and movement. 
  <br>
  Kate&#146;s photography also addresses the concept of intimacy. One print focuses 
  on a single leaf of a plant which Kate selected for its unremarkable, yet somehow 
  undismissable beauty. She emphasizes an element of depth, hoping to invite the 
  reader into her photograph in the same way that the leaf invited her into aesthetic 
  contemplation. Kate&#146;s favorite photograph consists of a hand stretched 
  sensuously across a pillow, grasping a rose in the early morning light. There 
  is simultaneously a sense of innocence and a hint of sexuality in this photo, 
  playing upon the mythology of sexual discovery. The work is situational, inviting 
  us to invent the narrative which culminates in this photograph.<br>
  Kate would not limit her works to one particular implication but it is important 
  that there are implications to what she captures on film. She developed her 
  penchant for photographic dialog during her photography classes at Bowdoin with 
  professor John McKee. She remarks that he is an &#147;amazing professor who 
  really makes you think about everything; you have to look at the whole world 
  to take a great photo.&#148; Kate has taken three photography classes at Bowdoin 
  and she is currently a teaching assistant for the introductory photo course. 
  She wants to communicate to other Bowdoin students a sense of the existential 
  imperative of photography. Before discovering photography Kate thought she had 
  no artistic talent, joking that she could not even draw a stick figure. While 
  the sentiment borders on the clich&eacute;, we might say that Kate Maselli&#146;s 
  work demonstrates that it is indeed never too late to discover something about 
  yourself.<br>
  Kate plans to maintain her dual interest in physics and photography after she 
  graduates from Bowdoin this spring. She hopes to become a high school physics 
  teacher and perhaps teach photography. Even if she cannot find room for photography 
  in her life at an occupational level, Kate says she cannot help but involve 
  photography in her life at a philosophical level in the aesthetically attuned 
  way in which she encounters the world.<br>

<h3>The Quill:Bowdoin&#146;s Literary Haven<br>
</h3>
<h5>JULIAN WALDO<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>
</h5>
<p>For the past few years, a very valuable resource of Bowdoin has been deprived 
  of public recognition. Proof of this is when one asks most students what The 
  Quill is, and they are unable to tell you anything about it. However, the staff 
  of The Quill (Bowdoin&#146;s one and only literary magazine, for those of you 
  who don&#146;t know) is just as dedicated as that of any other club or sport 
  on campus.<br>
  The literary magazine is published once a year in the spring, and despite its 
  name, it accepts more than just the usual literary work, such as poems, short 
  stories, plays and the like. It also incorporates original photos, drawings, 
  paintings, sketches, and doodles &#150; basically anything creative that can 
  be displayed on a page.<br>
  Moreover, the magazine accepts such submissions year round, giving students 
  a chance to submit their pieces as soon as they are written, rather than forcing 
  them to languish in a drawer, forgotten, until some distant date in the spring. 
  Another advantage of this policy is that it allows the author to receive virtually 
  immediate feedback, giving them a chance to edit their submission, as well as 
  guidelines for future submissions.<br>
  Because of this rolling admissions policy, the editors must work year round 
  to assess the submissions. So, every Thursday night, rain or shine, the editors 
  of the magazine gather from near and far to discuss student submissions of creative 
  work (and supposedly have fun doing it, although this has not been confirmed).<br>
  The submissions are all judged anonymously, ensuring that no petty jealousies, 
  or even full-blown feuds, can thwart the creative process. Not that the staff 
  is jealous of anyone, and they certainly have no feuds, but the measure is in 
  place, just in case.<br>
  The meetings are about more than just reading student submissions, though. The 
  staff starts by looking at work from masterful artists and authors of the past, 
  not to use as a standard of judgment (for, after all, who can compete with a 
  James Joyce or an Albrecht D&uuml;rer?), but rather to provide some inspiration, 
  ensuring that The Quill never settles for second best.<br>
  For the goal of The Quill, as Larisa Reznik, co-Editor in Chief of the magazine, 
  states, &#147;is to publish a quality compilation of diverse and vibrant work 
  the celebrates the talent of the Bowdoin student community.&#148; Integral to 
  such a mission is the process of examining the work of prior authors, who provide 
  a perspective for the discussions at the Thursday meetings.<br>
  For those students who are interested in seeing what The Quill looks like, back 
  issues are available at the Smith Union Information Desk. Also at the Information 
  Desk is the submissions box for The Quill, which is checked regularly by the 
  Editors, Jenny Morse and Larisa Reznik. <br>
  Students interested in more information about The Quill&#146;s submissions policies, 
  or even in becoming part of The Quill staff, should contact the editors, Jenny 
  Morse &#146;02 (<a href="mailto:jmorse2@bowdoin.edu">jmorse2@bowdoin.edu</a>) 
  and Larisa Reznik &#146;02 (<a href="mailto:lreznik@bowdoin.edu">lreznik@bowdoin.edu</a>).

<h3>Leprechaun 4 is magically delicious<br>
</h3>
<h5>SIMON MANGIARACINA<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>
</h5>
<p>After spending a semester in Italy, watching way too much Italian television, 
  I have happily returned to review some of the best direct-to-video films that 
  Video Galaxy has to offer. While Italian TV was fascinating, I have missed feature-length 
  films such as Femalien, Killer Tongue, and even Killer Eye. <br>
  During the summer I considered changing the format of this column a bit. At 
  first I wanted to cover a terrific program on Italian television that I watched 
  with some frequency, titled Colpo Grosso, which loosely translates to Blow Fat. 
  The program is a game-show of sorts, which involves contestants stripping for 
  money, and also a regular cast of talented female co-hosts who also strip when 
  contestants answer questions correctly. While I never fully understood the rules 
  of the show, I found myself consistently captivated. <br>
  Another direction I considered taking the column was more towards the seedier 
  side of the video market, namely pornographic films, and their relationship 
  to popular film in the more mainstream market. For instance, I could review 
  the role of male/ female relationships in Disney&#146;s popular animated release 
  Pocahontas, as compared to Vivid&#146;s less well known Poke-a-hot-ass. Or, 
  I could compare the revolutionary visuals in Stanley Kubrick&#146;s 2001: A 
  Space Odyssey with those in the softcore classic 2069: A Sex Odyssey. And how 
  about plot-development in Pokemon: The First Movie versus Shut Up and Blow Me 
  Part 4. Well, maybe that last one doesn&#146;t work quite so well, but I think 
  you get the idea. After much consideration, I realized that in order to do a 
  column such as this, I would have to watch quite a bit of porn. While that may 
  be well and good, I would have to frequent the adult section of Video Galaxy 
  on a weekly basis; and let&#146;s face it, I&#146;m way too shy for that. <br>
  So by default, it&#146;s back to the same old grind. For those of you who are 
  not familiar with my column, each and every week I will review a new direct-to-video 
  film. These movies are so innovative and ahead of their time, that a wide release 
  in theaters would not make financial sense, since only a small audience is sophisticated 
  enough to fully appreciate them. This week I am reviewing the fifth installment 
  of the ever-popular Leprechaun series, Leprechaun in the Hood, starring Ice-T. 
  After success as a solo rap-artist, his band&#146;s controversial classic single 
  Cop-killer, and the lead role as an under-cover police officer in the influential 
  film New Jack City, it is only natural that Ice-T would choose to move on to 
  more avant-guard work such as Leprechaun in the Hood. While Leprechaun 4: Leprechaun 
  in Space was a telling and introspective spoof on the sci-fi genre of film, 
  it&#146;s successor takes on a more serious tone. Leprechaun in the Hood is 
  a revealing study of three up-and-coming rap artists from the streets of Compton 
  struggling to make their way to success, and one bad-ass leprechaun who gets 
  in their way.<br>
  Three young rap-artists, Butch, Stray-Bullet, and Postmaster P, need some funding 
  to enter themselves in a rap contest which could send them to the finals in 
  Vegas and win them a record deal. But when the local pimp/record-producer Mac 
  Daddy (Ice-T) turns them down, our down-on-their-luck rappers decide to break 
  into the big man&#146;s office and steal his gold. A flash-back sequence reveals 
  the secret to Mac&#146;s success: years ago he stole his wealth and a magic 
  flute from a leprechaun who had been turned to stone. Our boys botch the heist, 
  and awaken the wrath of the leprechaun, sending the little man after them, as 
  well as one grumpy Mac Daddy. The remainder of the movie is spent in chaotic 
  violence as both Mac Daddy and the leprechaun hunt for the three rappers. The 
  leprechaun spends his time chillin&#146; with his zombie fly-girls, and smoking 
  the chronic. &#147;A friend with weed is a friend indeed&#148;, the stoned ghetto 
  leprechaun rhymes. When he&#146;s not smoking a blunt, he&#146;s seducing women 
  with his new urban-flava of seduction, &#147;Come closer, come closer my lass, 
  let me get a look at you before I tap your ass.&#148; The leprechaun even has 
  a sexual encounter with a transvestite male prostitute. As the little green 
  bad-boy hunts down Butch, Stray Bullet, and Postmaster P, he kills a lot of 
  people. He cuts their fingers off, dismembers them and pickles the body parts 
  in separate jars, blows holes clear through their chests, and impales someone 
  with his arm. But our three heroes don&#146;t leave the leprechaun unscathed. 
  They yell insults at him like, &#147;Yo shorty, you ain&#146;t even as big as 
  my dick!&#148; They set fire to him, and with a little help from the book Leprechauns 
  for Dummies they get him stoned off some weed mixed with four-leaf clovers. 
  With a cameo appearance by Coolio, a bumpin&#146; leprechaun rap sequence at 
  the end, and lines like &#147;Man, bitches and hoes ain&#146;t all the man knows,&#148; 
  Leprechaun in the Hood is one of the finest films I have ever had the pleasure 
  of watching. A++! </p>

  A Musical Weekend with the Bowdoin Film Society<br>
</h3>
<h5>BY JIM FLANAGAN<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR<br>
</h5>
<p>Once again you find yourself on the Bowdoin campus. The summer is now past, 
  along with the rather lackluster bunch of summer movies you thought it would 
  be a good idea to spend eight bucks on, each. Classes have begun and you are 
  slowly remembering why you hate homework so much. Then you pick up the first 
  Orient of the year and you read something that brightens your day: the Bowdoin 
  Film Society is back with a semester jam-packed with lots of great, free movies. 
  What a wonderful time to be a Bowdoin student. You are so overcome with joy, 
  you feel like you could burst out in song. Well, I wouldn&#146;t recommend doing 
  that (especially if you are secretly reading this in class), but don&#146;t 
  fret, because this weekend&#146;s movies will satisfy your urge to sing and 
  dance. As always, the movies will be shown in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall, 
  and are open to everyone.</p>

  Little Shop of Horrors (1986)<br>
  Directed by: Frank Oz<br>
  Starring: Rick Moranis, Ellen Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, 
  Jim Belushi, John Candy, Christopher Guest, and Levi Stubbs.<br>
  Returning film fans will remember the slight mess-up last semester when we tried 
  to show this film, not realizing that the copy we had obtained was actually 
  the 1960 George Romero horror/comedy that this film is based on. We&#146;ve 
  made sure that this time you&#146;ll be able to see the correct musical version.<br>
  This musical&#146;s story is the classic tale we&#146;re all accustomed to: 
  boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boy&#146;s evil space-plant gets a taste 
  for human blood and doesn&#146;t want boy to leave with girl. It features some 
  really classic showtunes: &#147;Skid Row (Downtown),&#148; Steve Martin belting 
  out &#147;Dentist!&#148; and my favorite, &#147;Mean Green Mother from Outer 
  Space.&#148; The acting is also top notch. Rick Moranis is perfect as the nerdy, 
  love-struck florist (I think it&#146;s his best role as a non-Canadian). Ellen 
  Greene is truly unforgettable as Audrey, mainly because of her voice. And Steve 
  Martin, well, is he ever bad? Come on, he plays a maniac dentist who loves to 
  hurt his patients. &#147;Is it safe?&#148; Indeed. There are also a bunch of 
  great cameos by some of the best comics of the mid 80&#146;s. But the real star 
  of the film is Audrey II. She is truly unique in all of cinema. This is one 
  plant Barry Logan hasn&#146;t exposed you to, so you better check this movie 
  out.<br>
  Rated PG-13</p>
<p>Friday at 9pm<br>
  Singing in the Rain (1952)<br>
  Directed by: Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly<br>
  Starring: Gene Kelly, Donald O&#146;Connor, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, and 
  Cyd Charisse<br>
  This is perhaps the greatest of all film musicals (I guess I can say that since 
  This is Spinal Tap isn&#146;t technically a musical). It&#146;s a love story 
  set at that famous period in the late twenties when the film industry first 
  began to use sound in the majority of its movies. Because you had to speak well 
  in order to be an actor, your career could be gone overnight. That is the problem 
  facing the beautiful movie star Hagen, who has a voice just as &#147;interesting&#148; 
  as Greene&#146;s Audrey. To the rescue comes the trio of Kelly, O&#146;Connor, 
  and Reynolds, who have the great idea of letting Debbie say all of Hagen&#146;s 
  lines off stage. Many madcap problems arise (though all my old Hitchcock buddies 
  can see what kind of troubles Hitch went through in making Blackmail).<br>
  Along the way there are all the musical standards: people falling in love, huge 
  dance numbers, and lots of classic songs, including &#147;Make &#145;em Laugh,&#148; 
  &#147;Good Morning,&#148; and Gene Kelly&#146;s classic rendition of the title 
  song. It&#146;s one of the most memorable of all film moments.<br>
  Rated G</p>
<p>Saturday at 7pm<br>
  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)<br>
  Directed by: Trey Parker<br>
  Starring: Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Mary Kay Bergman, Isaac Hayes, George Clooney, 
  Minnie Driver, Eric Idle, Dave Foley, Brent Spinner and &#147;Saddam Hussein&#148;.<br>
  What Mel Brooks did to the Western genre with &#147;Blazing Saddles&#148; Trey 
  Parker and Matt Stone have done to musicals with this film. This movie takes 
  no prisoners and no one is spared. If you don&#146;t want to be offended, then 
  you shouldn&#146;t see this movie. But if you don&#146;t mind being insulted 
  (along with every other person in the theater), then by all means come on out.<br>
  The story is a simple one. The four boys we all know and love happen to catch 
  the vulgar, R-rated Terrance and Phillip movie. This outrages the adults of 
  South Park, and the obvious outcome, a full-scale war with Canada, ensues. This 
  movie is much more than just a silly cartoon, it pays homage to the entire musical 
  genre. Yes, it will help if you are familiar with the television program, but 
  anyone can enjoy this movie. It features such catchy tunes as: &#147;It&#146;s 
  Easy, Mmmkay,&#148; &#147;What Would Brian Boitano Do?&#148; &#147;Blame Canada,&#148; 
  and Trey Parker&#146;s classic ode to old-fashioned uncle loving.<br>
  Rated R</p>
<p>Saturday at 9pm<br>
  Everyone Says I Love You (1996)<br>
  Written and Directed by: Woody Allen<br>
  Starring: Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Natasha Lyonne, Alan Alda, Gabby Hoffman, 
  Natalie Portman, Goldie Hawn, Julia Roberts, Lukas Haas, Tim Roth and Woody 
  Allen.<br>
  Woody Allen&#146;s musical is the story of an upper-class woman from Manhattan, 
  her current husband, her ex-husband, and all of their children. There are trips 
  to Paris and Venice in search of love. Problems arise when new characters are 
  introduced in order to break up the two lovebirds (Hawn&#146;s daughter Barrymore 
  and Norton). <br>
  Although you wouldn&#146;t think of these actors as singers, all except for 
  Drew Barrymore use their real voices. Then again, Allen didn&#146;t tell his 
  actors that they were in a musical until after they signed the contracts, so 
  I guess it was something of a surprise for all of them. Like South Park, this 
  movie pays homage to the old, classic musicals, so it should appeal to both 
  fans of the genre and of Woody&#146;s own brand of humor.<br>
  Rated R</p>
<p>Sneak Preview: Coming next week, a set of movies all you film geeks know and 
  love: the movies of Kevin Smith. Until then, feel free to get some mid-week 
  entertainment by checking out the Film Studies 10 and 101 class films: Sunrise 
  (1927; 9/12 @ 6, 9/13 @ 8) and Scarface (1932; 9/12 @ 8, 9/13 @ 6)<br>
