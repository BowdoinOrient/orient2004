<h1>Opinion</h1>
<h2>Editorials</h2>
<h3>A plea for the community<br>
</h3>
<p>In the past few days, we have debated the content of this, our first editorial 
  of the year. While our initial reaction was to address the derogatory graffiti 
  recently found in Coles Tower, each of us found ourselves, at one point or another, 
  trying to convince another editor to write this piece. Although we were all 
  eager to scold the disturbing behavior, no one wanted the daunting task of trying 
  to ascertain why some people are so threatened by difference, and more so, why 
  some members of our community felt it was acceptable to express their fear in 
  the form of derogatory slurs.<br>
  To these questions we found no concrete answers. Most of us are used to finding 
  the right answers when involved in an academic endeavor. That&#146;s why we 
  were accepted to Bowdoin. When a definitive answer cannot be found, it is tempting 
  to deem the question invalid and move on to a problem we can more easily solve. 
  But, while we are frustrated by the lack of answers or any concrete conclusion 
  regarding the derogatory graffiti in Coles Tower, the question cannot be put 
  away, but rather, must continually be revisited so that with time, perhaps some 
  understanding will lead to positive change.<br>
  Some people have argued that perhaps the perpetrators were drunk. However, while 
  drinking alcohol may remove social inhibitions and affect a person&#146;s judgment, 
  the influence of alcohol cannot transform a person&#146;s true beliefs. <br>
  During the daylight hours, when we sit together in class, eat together in the 
  dining halls, and exchange greetings on the Quad, Bowdoin could be mistaken 
  for a utopian community in which, despite our differences, we freely accept 
  each other. While many members of our community do in fact value individual 
  differences, we too often find that, when not exposed to the community at large, 
  or after having a few beers at a party, people express feelings they know could 
  be deemed politically incorrect and insensitive by many of us.<br>
  Although such closet prejudice may seem less obtrusive than public displays 
  of intolerance, the results are just as damaging, perhaps more so. The graffiti 
  in Coles Tower reminded us that, despite the polite and pristine appearance 
  of our student body, we are not in fact a utopian community. Most frustrating 
  is the fact that we are deemed powerless by such acts of closet prejudice. Because 
  the perpetrator was too cowardly to constructively address his or her fear of 
  difference, we the community are left with no chance for rebuttal. However, 
  we can each make a conscious effort to confront members of the community who, 
  behind closed doors, express prejudiced views. What may seem like merely an 
  offensive comment will inevitably translate to offensive and possibly destructive 
  behavior in the future.</p>
<h2>Letters to the Editors<br>
</h2>
<h3>Republicans Come Out at Bowdoin<br>
</h3>
To the Editors:
<p>I&#146;ll come right out and say it: I am a registered Republican. Not only 
  that, I am an active Republican. At this point, I expect one of three responses 
  from the reader: 1. Oh God, not an evil Republican; 2. Republican? What&#146;s 
  that?; or 3. Yay! I&#146;m not alone! For the number ones, I&#146;m not going 
  to try to convert you in this letter, so feel free to stop reading now. For 
  the number twos, hang in there, you might learn something. For the number threes, 
  you aren&#146;t alone.<br>
  First, what is a Republican? Someone who is anti-choice and anti-homosexuals? 
  Someone who wants a machine gun in every house? Someone who wants to pave the 
  forests and let the poor starve? If so, then I guess I am not a Republican. 
  Unfortunately, those are the things that people associate with Republicans, 
  simply because our solutions to problems are not the easy quick fixes that the 
  other guys offer. I consider myself a Republican because I believe in the power 
  of the individual, not the government. I believe that the government should 
  provide only those services that individuals and private groups cannot perform 
  themselves. In short, I believe that the government should act as a referee 
  in a baseball game, not as a parent caring for a helpless child.<br>
  When I came to Bowdoin last year, I hoped to get involved with a college Republican 
  group and &#147;do something.&#148; Instead, I found that any political talk 
  was taboo and many people had little idea of the principles behind either party 
  and no idea who their congressional representatives were. At a college where 
  government is the largest department and one of the most popular majors, the 
  lack of political activism is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the majority 
  of the student body are American citizens who will shortly be paying taxes and 
  ought to care about decisions which will directly affect their lives. <br>
  To fill the political void here, a few students have organized to bring back 
  the College Republicans. Already, there are Republicans coming out of the woodwork 
  who have felt that Bowdoin has not been a place where they can express their 
  political views. We have been busy recruiting the necessary ten members so that 
  we can have a nationally recognized chapter. In fact, we are receiving a surprisingly 
  enthusiastic response and we expect a membership of between 25 and 30 members. 
  Professor Jean Yarbrough has kindly agreed to serve as our advisor. <br>
  That&#146;s all well and good. But what are we going to actually do to bring 
  some political involvement, activity, and discourse to an otherwise apathetic 
  campus? So far, we have made a small trip to attend George W. Bush&#146;s arrival 
  rally in Portland and several of us even attended the Republican National Convention 
  in Philadelphia, PA, this summer. This fall, we will be supporting local politicians 
  such as congressional candidate Jane Amero, in addition to volunteering for 
  George W. Bush&#146;s campaign. We also will organize on-campus events with 
  guest speakers, debates, and info sessions about the candidates.<br>
  Now, why should you, the persistent reader who is still with me, give up some 
  of your time and join the Bowdoin College Republicans? How about this: you are 
  in the awful situation of having your parents die in an airplane crash. While 
  you are mourning, you receive a call from the Internal Revenue Service telling 
  you that you owe the Federal Government approximately 72 percent of the money 
  that your parents had worked their entire lives for because of the combined 
  death tax and the federal income tax. Or this: the minimum wage increase is 
  passed, and you are excited because you think that you&#146;ll be making more 
  money at your summer job, but when you talk to your boss you find that you have 
  no job at all because the increase means that your boss can no longer afford 
  to keep you on the payroll since the Democratic President refused to give small 
  businesses a tax break to offset the minimum wage increase. Or less personally: 
  Poor people in New York City die in record numbers this winter from the cold 
  because they cannot pay their home heating bill since the Democratic administration 
  refused to allow oil companies to produce more oil. <br>
  I can give you trillions of reasons to get involved. Literally, trillions. Trillions, 
  because that is how much money the government spends each year. That&#146;s 
  your money: you should have a say in how it is spent and see that it is spent 
  wisely. To get involved, please email khorsman or tbuell. Let the debate begin.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>

<h3>George &#147;Dubya&#148; Bush, Idiot Extraordinaire<br>
</h3>
<h5>DAVID BIELAK<br>
  Contributor<br>
</h5>
<p>I really don&#146;t like George W. Bush. To be completely honest, I&#146;m 
  not a big fan of either major-party candidate. I&#146;ve heard quite a few angry 
  remarks regarding Al Gore, some of which are completely rational, and several 
  (thousand) heated comments about George W. Bush, known affectionately to some, 
  albeit few, as &#147;Dubya.&#148; I don&#146;t believe that either man has the 
  strengths nor leadership qualities necessary to become president. However, seeing 
  as how the other candidates are limited to a white-robed, red-faced, cross-burning 
  crusader and an underappreciated environmentalist (and we all know how they 
  never win), I don&#146;t think we have much choice but to decide between the 
  first two. <br>
  Thinking about voting for Nader? Well, so am I, but unfortunately, casting a 
  vote for a third-party candidate is utterly useless. Sure, Nader would gain 
  some recognition. He&#146;d go home to his Green-Party headquarters where he&#146;ll 
  be thrown a splendid (read: dry) party for securing two percent of the vote, 
  and his wife will give him a little extra loving in bed, but where does that 
  leave us? Since every vote for Nader is presumably one taken from Gore, it leaves 
  us with Dubya, a man who admittedly inhaled (unlike Clinton with his little 
  weed experiment) cocaine. Cocaine that was shipped first class from Columbia 
  next to a pound of Juan Valdez&#146;s finest roast. Somewhere outside of Bogota, 
  a baron is being given a French manicure paid for by our potential future president. 
  Keep in mind that this same individual, albeit reformed by the almighty will 
  of God, supports mandatory minimum sentencing for marijuana dealers. Now, as 
  GWBush.com (a parody site) so eloquently pointed out, we&#146;re not just talking 
  seasoned-veteran pot smugglers. No no. Under Dubya&#146;s system of justice, 
  a 40-year-old mother of two would be incarcerated for selling a poppy plant 
  that, unknown to her, was later used to produce opium in someone&#146;s basement 
  lab. This is not just unfair, this is hypocrisy, pure and raw. A man who evaded 
  being punished for his crime wishes to crack down on those committing far less 
  grievous offences. This is like drunkenly running over a small child, then chastising 
  others for jaywalking. Or, to use a more recent and relevant analogy, like condemning 
  a man for having an extramarital affair (it wasn&#146;t even real sex!) while 
  sleeping with your secretary. <br>
  Oh wait. In all of this excitement about Bush, I almost forgot to discuss his 
  cheery running mate, Dick Cheney. But know what? I&#146;d really just prefer 
  talking about his wife. According to Newsweek, her desire to abolish the National 
  Endowment for the Arts was so conservative, even NRA leader/Moses Charlton Heston 
  opposed it. And what does Lynne, an opponent of gays in the military and of 
  homosexual marriages, have to say about the fact that her daughter is a lesbian? 
  &#147;No comment.&#148; That shows a lot of class. It seems to me if husband 
  Dick&#146;s smiling photo weren&#146;t plastered on billboards all over the 
  nation, their daughter would be locked up in the broom closet with a weekly 
  bucket of fish heads to munch on. Compassionate conservatism, eh? Oh, and Dick 
  was opposed to the abolition of apartheid. True fact. But back to Dubya&#133; 
  <br>
  Bush&#146;s main faults lie in the fact that he&#146;s just plain stupid, yet 
  has had everything handed to him on a silver plate since childbirth. You all 
  know the types. Like that kid that made the soccer team just because his dad 
  was the coach? Remember him? Bush attended Phillips Andover Acadamy in Massachusetts 
  for four years with a cumulative grade point average hovering around a C. Not 
  that there&#146;s anything wrong with that; it&#146;s just that it makes the 
  fact that he got into Yale a bit curious. I know students who virtually governed 
  small nations who didn&#146;t get into Yale. And so we ask the inevitable question: 
  who&#146;s pulling the strings? <br>
  Okay, so to speed things up a bit, we&#146;ll now fast-forward through Bush&#146;s 
  adult years as financial devastator for several oil companies, hooded executioner, 
  and courageous educator (he reaches out to those poor Mexican children and addresses 
  them in their own language!!). Let&#146;s jump right to a quote from Alex Nosnik 
  across the hall: &#147;George W. Bush Jr., the present governor of my lovely 
  state of Texas, is a nincompoop. He has done nothing for our state but increase 
  the death toll, both by giving any individual the right to walk the world strapped 
  to the tooth with weapons and by killing more prisoners then ever recorded. 
  He consistently dodges every question that is laid at his door, and not in the 
  manner that we have come to expect from politicians, but in a way that makes 
  me question whether or not he actually understands anything anyone says. He&#146;s 
  a good old boy from the Northeast who struts the world as an egotistical Texan, 
  which turns out to be a very lethal combination. If you&#146;re a fan of gun-slinging 
  Americans who disrespect women&#146;s rights and assume to have a greater knowledge 
  about the &#147;way life should be&#148; then Bush is your man, but for now, 
  all I can say is be afraid. Be very, very afraid.&#148; <br>
  Which reminds me, in an infamously scandalized TV reporter&#146;s pop-quiz, 
  Bush conceded to not knowing the prime ministers of either India or Pakistan. 
  Admittedly, I don&#146;t have the slightest idea as to who the prime minister 
  of Pakistan is. But I&#146;m not running for president. </p>

<h3>Sisterly Advice for First Years<br>
</h3>
<h5>ACADIA SENESE<br>
  Contributor<br>
</h5>
<p>Well, Angie, welcome to Bowdoin College. Welcome to the campus that so many 
  of us adopted &#145;Maineacs&#146; call home. Welcome to one of the most exciting 
  experiences that you will have yet encountered. There is just so much that one 
  can say to an incoming student, so very much to share and to reflect upon-and 
  so very much more to say when that incoming student is your younger sister. 
  But while advice abounds for a younger sibling, most of that information ironically 
  applies to many of us seasoned students.<br>
  As the new year approaches, most of us start class with a heightened enthusiasm 
  and an eagerness to learn. Despite the fact that this enthusiasm will quickly 
  fade as the work increases and the time somehow disappears, we inevitably approach 
  the upcoming fall months with positive anticipation. We all intend to take the 
  class that we never took last semester, join the club we never quite had time 
  for, plan the trip that was somehow forgotten in one of last year&#146;s busy 
  weekends, go to those meetings that you know you should attend, or start training 
  for the sport you are quickly realizing that you should already be in shape 
  for. We all intend to spend more time with our freshman-year roommate, have 
  dinner with the professor who influenced our major, and to attend every common 
  hour offered by the College. It is with great intentions that we begin our fall 
  here at Bowdoin, but, all too often, we end the semester with four-month-old 
  &#147;to do&#148; lists. If there were one thing that would make this semester 
  better than the others, it would be to retain that initial enthusiasm one finds 
  after a summer of mental relaxation, for as long as the semester endures. <br>
  And yes, Angie, you may have no idea what I am referring to, since it is very 
  atypical of you to say and never do, but Bowdoin changes many of us. Be wary 
  first years: hang on to the identity that you brought with you. In the class 
  that is being hailed as the most diverse on campus, keep those things for which 
  you were chosen to be here. Retain those intentions that so many of us upperclassmen 
  see slipping away as fast as the weekends do.<br>
  And so, enjoy these upcoming months. Delve into anything and everything that 
  you have wanted to do. Comedian David Ester who appeared in the pub last Friday, 
  spoke of this very issue. He suggested that for one to get the most out of a 
  very expensive education, you should get involved with everything possible, 
  absolutely everything. He even suggested attending class lectures that we are 
  not signed up for. I say go for it. After all, that is what we are all here 
  for: to get the most out of our Bowdoin education. We are here to carry out 
  those intentions that we all initially bring to campus.<br>
  So, first years, welcome to Bowdoin. To us returning students, here&#146;s to 
  making this semester the best yet. And, Angie, I am thrilled to have you here 
  with me, although I have so very much more advice to give you.</p>

<h3>The Nader Manifesto:The Urgency of Third Party Politics<br>
</h3>
<h5>RYAN WALSH-MARTEL<br>
  Contributor<br>
</h5>
<p>If you have been paying attention to the farce trying to pass itself off as 
  a political campaign this year and feeling more disgusted than an uptight Bible 
  Belter watching South Park, you probably really wish that someone else besides 
  the bickering Democrats and Republicans would present themselves as a legitimate 
  and unique choice. Well that candidate exists, and no, it is not Pat Buchanan, 
  although he would certainly redefine America, albeit more along the lines of 
  Nazi Germany. I am speaking of Ralph Nader, a man who has been tirelessly and 
  thanklessly advocating your rights as a citizen and consumer since before your 
  parents got drunk that night camping and decided to play &#147;Smokey The Bear 
  puts out the bush fire.&#148; <br>
  Ralph Nader is running for President as the nominee from the Green Party, and 
  right now he is America&#146;s best alternative. The process of electing a president 
  in the United States is archaic, is unfair to small parties and panders to the 
  needs and desires of big business. In fact, that sums up the current status 
  of our entire government. At least we have a choice as to who we elect; but 
  in the past few decades that choice has become less and less clear, as party 
  platforms become more and more similar, and both stagnate behind a mask of change 
  and progress. In recent years, our choice of leaders has been effectively reduced 
  to our choice of fast food. The burger looks so good on television, but in reality 
  it is overpriced, cold, tiny, pumped up with hormones, and every restaurant, 
  from McDonalds to Burger King, is the same as the next. <br>
  There hasn&#146;t been a time in America&#146;s history when we and our leaders 
  have so blatantly ignored the shortcomings of government and society and harped 
  only on the positive. I, for one, can&#146;t even use a public restroom without 
  seeing an essay scrawled on the wall about the booming economy. (Whatever happened 
  to witty limericks about that guy from Nantucket?) I&#146;m sure you have all 
  heard the statistics before, but I&#146;ll bring them out again just to refresh 
  your memory. The economic boom is benefiting only the richest percentage of 
  Americans, and that is mostly from special tax breaks for the rich and loopholes 
  in environmental laws for big companies. The richest 20 percent of the nation 
  controls 80 percent of the wealth. The gap between the rich and the poor is 
  the widest it has ever been in American history, and is increasing. Real wages 
  are lower than they were in 1979. For at least half of the nation (i.e. the 
  bottom half), there is no economic boom. None.<br>
  Many in America believe that this government and electoral process has to be 
  changed, and changed more urgently than my roommate&#146;s socks (hey you don&#146;t 
  live with him). But who are our traditional Democratic and Republican candidates 
  with which to effect change? They are George W. Bush, that great paragon of 
  American virtue and intelligence (Oh, nevermind, I was thinking of Dan Quayle), 
  or Al Gore, who is more whipped by Clinton and the latest public opinion poll 
  than my roommate by his girlfriend, and that&#146;s saying a lot. Republicans 
  in their &#147;compassionate conservatism&#148; are adopting, or at least espousing 
  many staples of the Democratic platform. Bush is making concessions on abortion 
  and talking up education, while Gore talks of (seriously) a missile defense 
  system - a goal laughed at by anyone with a shred of common sense who isn&#146;t 
  being paid billions to actually build the silly thing. Let&#146;s face it, there 
  isn&#146;t any more real difference between Gore and Bush than between Burger 
  King and McDonalds, or Pepsi and Coke: You think you can taste the difference, 
  but you can&#146;t. <br>
  Okay, so maybe I have embellished a bit, because there are differences between 
  Gore and Bush, and one could even argue that they are significant. But if you 
  desire the kind of restructuring of the electoral process and of the government&#146;s 
  relationship with big business that I do, then neither is a viable option. Ralph 
  Nader is. Born in 1934 to immigrant Lebanese parents in Winsted, Connecticut, 
  Nader attended Princeton as an undergraduate and then went on to Harvard Law 
  School. He gained national recognition as an activist and a consumer rights 
  advocate when he wrote Unsafe At Any Speed, an expos&eacute; of Chevrolet&#146;s 
  shoddily built Corvair. He is also responsible for founding many civil and environmental 
  activist groups around the nation and has spurred such landmark laws as the 
  Freedom of Information Act and the Clean Air Act. <br>
  Nader is a man who genuinely wants to change the way things are. His biggest 
  goal is to remove corporate interest from Washington and to replace it with 
  (gasp!) public interest. He also wants to completely revamp the electoral process, 
  which is mired in the politics of big business. He wants stricter enforcement 
  of current environ-mental standards and eventually stricter environmental laws. 
  Nader wants people to become active participants in their government and to 
  have children take a class or two in school on how to become active and caring 
  citizens and to let their voices be heard. He wants to crack down on corporate 
  crime and fraud. He wants universal healthcare. He&#146;s not a revolutionary. 
  He desires simply to make all of America great, not just the top 20 percent 
  of it.<br>
  Now, what has Gore or Bush done that demonstrates either deserves to be president? 
  Gore has done a respectable job, fighting in Vietnam and eventually serving 
  in the Senate for a number of years before being elected Vice-President, but 
  his associations with and actions in the Clinton Administration (no, he didn&#146;t 
  have an intern) show that while Gore has good ideas (i.e. protecting the environment), 
  he really hasn&#146;t acted on his beliefs and often sacrifices his ideals to 
  please corporate interest. Bush is another story altogether. He graduated from 
  Princeton with a gentlemen&#146;s C, and then immediately and fearlessly joined 
  the National Guard and defended Texas from the Communists. After that he worked 
  overtime on his alcoholism until someone bought him the Texas Rangers, and poof! 
  he was qualified to be governor of Texas and is now, according to some, the 
  most popular option for leader of the free world. Only in America, right?<br>
  Ralph Nader is a patriot. He believes in the fundamental systems on which our 
  forefathers founded this nation. But he believes that somewhere along the way 
  the explosion of huge, powerful, and unchecked corporations has not only drowned 
  out their voices but has also brainwashed most Americans. The guy working in 
  the local factory who feels abused by his company can&#146;t pay $10,000 for 
  a chance to plead his case to Gore or Bush at a fundraising dinner. Exxon and 
  Dupont can, and do. And they don&#146;t ask for simple things like raising the 
  minimum wage to a livable level. No, they say &#147;Hey Al, buddy, you know 
  that bill that could prevent us from logging the national wildlife reserve, 
  gee that&#146;s really a thorn in our side. We&#146;ve always been a big supporter 
  of you and do you think you could just see to it that it doesn&#146;t get passed?&#148; 
  That is straight-up bribery, it happens all the time, and it&#146;s legal. The 
  last I was aware, everyone in America had an equal voice: one vote. If you think 
  this corporate corruption needs to change, then vote for Ralph Nader, because 
  neither the Republicans nor the Democrats are going to do anything about it. 
  They are the same platform with different clothes on. McDonalds and Burger King.<br>
  Ralph Nader is different. He&#146;s the local hamburger joint where the wait 
  is longer and the food more expensive; but it&#146;s still worth it. Go buy 
  a burger at McDonalds or Burger King, and what do you get? A big roll with pickles, 
  onions, ketchup, and mustard, and an insignificant little pre-formed hamburger 
  patty: all fancy dressing with no substance. Go to your local restaurant and 
  what do you get? A big honkin&#146; half pound of beef that you have to eat 
  with two hands and a plate full of steaming hot fries. <br>
  Vote Nader for the 2000 presidential election and visit his website at www.votenader.com. 
  He brings the beef. (No offense to vegetarians, it&#146;s just an analogy.)</p>

<h3>Back to School, Elian Style<br>
</h3>
<h5>BEN GOTT<br>
  Contributor<br>
</h5>
<p>There&#146;s something about September that appeals to me, and I don&#146;t 
  know why. Even though it signals the end of summer, it also signals the beginning 
  of cold, crisp days, of trees painted red and gold, and of the first day of 
  school.<br>
  I suppose that it&#146;s a bit of a clich&eacute; to be writing my first column 
  about the first day of school, but I read something recently that reminded me 
  of the universality of this experience. Last Friday, the Associated Press carried 
  a story about the return to school of Elian Gonzalez, Cuba&#146;s most infamous 
  youngster. The story chronicles Elian&#146;s first day at the Marcelo Salado 
  school in Cardenas, and relates the seemingly mundane goings-on of a group of 
  children who would otherwise be distant from our lives, if not for their well-known 
  classmate. Perhaps most interestingly (and heart-warmingly), the A.P. article 
  describes the scene as the students go around the room, introducing themselves: 
  &#147;My name is Elian,&#148; the 6-year-old piped up when the teacher asked 
  all 28 kids in his second-grade class to introduce themselves. There was no 
  applause, no commentary, until every child has said his or her name - and then 
  they all applauded themselves.&#148;<br>
  There is something wonderfully comforting and reassuring in that sentiment. 
  While I am sure that Elian has suffered more than his share of sidelong glances, 
  this vignette illustrates that his classmates know something that the journalists 
  don&#146;t: <br>
  It&#146;s time to start over.<br>
  Even for those of us who are not as famous as Elian, the beginning of school 
  oftentimes carries that feeling with it. I can remember only a few first days 
  from my own elementary school, but I&#146;m sure that I always wore my new clothes, 
  and that I always had my shiny new pencils and my Trapper Keeper with the dinosaurs 
  on the front. And, even though I had been going to school with many of my classmates 
  for years, the first day always felt like a day unlike any other. There were, 
  I imagined, so many different possibilities. Anything could happen! As I got 
  older, first days got more and more complicated, and I found myself with more 
  and more responsibilities. Nevertheless, I couldn&#146;t shake that feeling 
  of newness, of beginning again.<br>
  So, as we embark upon another year at Bowdoin College, let&#146;s think about 
  it as a year of firsts. Last week, Craig Bradley reminded the senior class that 
  &#147;the year is almost over,&#148; and, although I understand his sentiment, 
  I couldn&#146;t disagree more. There is still so much to do this year, even 
  if there is so little time to do it in. For those of us who are at Bowdoin for 
  the first time: explore the campus, and the town of Brunswick. Take a drive 
  up the coast. Sign up to volunteer at the animal shelter or at the junior high. 
  Try to get a radio show on WBOR. And, for those of us who are nearing the end 
  of our careers here, take a moment to think about everything that you ever wanted 
  to do at Bowdoin, and do it. Now. Because, hey: this might be your last chance.<br>
  Over the course of the year, you&#146;ll see me write about a lot of things 
  - music, Halloween, the presidential election, people who yell at their children 
  in supermarkets - but I will say nothing that is as important as what I am going 
  to say now: <br>
  Happy first day of school. Now go have some fun.</p>

<h5>EZRA ROSS MILLER<br>
  Contributor<br>
</h5>
<p>Shortly before the end of my first year of college I, a lonely homesick kid 
  from the West Coast was accepted to become a proctor here at Bowdoin College. 
  The contract began two weeks before the majority of students were scheduled 
  to arrive on campus. Now after nearly three weeks, I sit in my homey college 
  brick watching and critiquing the campus from a new but still familiar point 
  of view. I&#146;ll begin with a little letter to the students of Bowdoin College. 
</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:<br>
  What is the deal with campus elections? I find it hard to believe that such 
  a diverse, bright, and accomplished new freshman class has the stomach to allow 
  future sleazy politicians to poster their homes with ridiculous promises and 
  virtually no helpful information. It is very frustrating to walk around campus 
  reading these posters knowing that inevitably one of these promise toting anonymous 
  public servants will someday make some decision that may actually affect the 
  students of the Class of 2004. <br>
  More than anything, this is a call to action. I want to see the first-year students 
  pull their heads from beneath pages and ask those who want to run their class 
  to explain themselves and their goals. And I&#146;m not talking about some high 
  and mighty little paragraph posted on some multi-linked page deep in the Bowdoin 
  technological maze. I want to see students getting up on an orange crate right 
  next to our favorite mascot and fielding questions about what it might actually 
  mean to be the president of a class of four hundred and fifty students. <br>
  Is it really necessary for these students to campaign now? To plaster their 
  names across brick and wood that they barely recognize? Give these future Gore 
  and Bush followers some time to actually form opinions and ideas about what 
  it&#146;s like to live here. How can these William Cohens cope with any problems 
  they encounter or decisions they have to make if they do not have knowledge 
  of either what the problems are or where to find the solutions? <br>
  It&#146;s frustrating for me, an active member of this lovely little &#147;community&#148;, 
  to sit back and watch this atrocity occur. What an opportunity we have to make 
  things happen around this often lonely and monotonous campus. Come one folks, 
  let&#146;s shake things up. </p>

<h5>The Country of the Pointed Firs Revisited<br>
</h5>
<h5>DANIEL JEFFERSON MILLER<br>
  Opinion Editor<br>
</h5>
<p>Sarah Orne Jewett H&#146;1901 once wrote, &#147;When one really knows a village 
  like this and its surroundings, it is like becoming acquainted with a single 
  person.&#148; This Maine born and raised writer was no stranger to the Bowdoin 
  College campus, her father was a professor of the medical College, and in her 
  lifetime she would become the first woman to receive any sort of degree from 
  the College. Aside from being closely associated with the college, Jewett lived 
  with her finger on the pulse of Maine life. Her interest in Maine was sparked 
  as a young child as she made house calls with her father, who served the town 
  of South Berwick as their physician. Arguably no author has paralleled her ability 
  to capture the essence of what she regarded as a vanishing culture, the Down 
  Eastern way of living. Writing with an urgency similar to Melville&#146;s attempts 
  to record the dying breed of New England&#146;s sailors, Jewett pinpoints a 
  way of life that she saw as vanishing, but that may not be completely extinct 
  today.<br>
  On Sunday, August 28, I pull out of my driveway in Saint Louis, Missouri. Ahead 
  of me lies 1,300 miles of highway leading to Bowdoin College, or as I say to 
  many Midwesterners, a small liberal arts college in Maine, just about half an 
  hour up the coast from Portland. They acknowledge the city of Portland, and 
  look back into their short-term memory to check if I said Maine, or Oregon. 
  I cross through the states of Illinois and Indiana before lunch time, passing 
  thousands of Amoco stations, Cracker Barrels, and Steak &#145;n Shakes - Midwestern 
  establishments that become fewer and farther between the deeper into the Northeast 
  I drive. With CDs that skip too often and farm town radio stations that crack 
  and fade before disappearing, I tune out whatever is emanating from the stereo 
  and open my eyes to the mammoth that is the state of Ohio. The seemingly impenetrable 
  final Midwestern state. It is between Columbus and Cleveland, heading Northeast 
  for the first time, that the land first begins to change noticeably. The cornfields 
  have been left behind at this point, and as I briefly cut through Pennsylvania, 
  I sense that I am fast approaching New England. I begin to feel like I am finally 
  making a dent in my journey- that is, before my spirit is crushed by the behemoth 
  that is known as the New York Thruway. <br>
  The globalization of major corporations will be the death of regionalism in 
  the United States; there&#146;s not a major city in this world that hasn&#146;t 
  been tainted in some way by corporate America. There&#146;s a McDonald&#146;s 
  in Saigon. I&#146;ve found though, that Brunswick is a die-hard town when it 
  comes to fighting off the bombardments of fast food, establishments that have 
  been cut straight off the assembly line. Brunswick pushes said businesses to 
  the virtually characterless Cook&#146;s Corner intersection just east down Bath 
  Road. Just across from the Brunswick Naval Air Station, rests Fatboy, the last 
  refuge of independent charm. Ahead lies Burger King, Staples, Papa Ginos, and 
  the like. I like walking into downtown Brunswick, and choosing between Big Top 
  and Broadway Deli, rather than between Burger King and McDonald&#146;s. <br>
  Just after I&#146;ve passed through Portsmouth, NH, and across the Maine border, 
  my gas light comes on, a cruelty as I begin my homestretch. So having come over 
  1,200 miles, and with less than 75 remaining, I&#146;m almost out of gas. Taking 
  the off ramp at the next advertised exit, I come to a fork in the road, with 
  no indication as to the direction of the nearest gas station. Another thing 
  about New England&#146;s charm: it&#146;s assumed too often that everyone already 
  knows where they are, and where they&#146;re going, thus there is no need for 
  road signs, street signs, etc. So I did the easiest thing I could have done, 
  I lost my way. And after pulling several U-turns, I spotted an older man working 
  in his yard. And as I asked him directions, I knew for the first time in nearly 
  four months that I was back in Maine. The dialect is like none other, not so 
  general as say, a Southern accent. Somewhat similar to that of other New England 
  states, but at the same time unmistakably Maine. The man provided directions 
  to the gas station, and from there, he told me how I would find my way back 
  to the highway. I got the sense that he&#146;d been asked before.<br>
  Sarah Orne Jewett feared the disappearance of a people, a way of life, and a 
  culture in itself. As one who comes from halfway across the country, and one 
  who spent his freshman year adjusting to a different way of life, I feel that 
  the Maine Jewett wrote so passionately about is safely off the endangered cultures 
  list. While in the 21st Century Bowdoin College students might be experiencing 
  a diluted version of Maine life compared to a century ago, life in Maine remains 
  unlike any other.</p>

<h3>Eminem and Consistency in the Media<br>
</h3>
<h5>GREG T. SPIELBERG<br>
  Sports Editor</h5>
<p>Christina Aguilera never saw it coming. But then again, neither did he. What 
  started out as a seemingly innocent quote on MTV has created a bitter whirlwind 
  of media that lands both Eminem and the teen pop-queen in a flailing heap on 
  the tongues of just about every American. <br>
  In response to what she thought about the blonde-haired rapper, Aguilera responded, 
  &#147;He&#146;s cute and everything, but he&#146;s got too many girls after 
  him. Besides, he&#146;s married, so I&#146;m going to stay away from that.&#148; 
  While her comments were both complimentary and cautious, Eminem&#146;s replies 
  have come in the form of inflatable dolls, slanderous sexual suggestions and 
  a &#147;Christina lyric&#148; on two of his last three singles (&#147;The Real 
  Slim Shady&#148; and &#147;Off the Wall&#148;). Aguilera, however, isn&#146;t 
  the only figure to be cut up by the sharp tongue of hip-hop&#146;s most controversial 
  artist since Ice T back in the days of &#147;Cop Killer.&#148;<br>
  And that&#146;s just the problem. Though the media and the public are willing 
  to brush off the very lopsided verbal sparring between Eminem and Christina 
  (and Britney Spears, N&#146;SYNC, Insane Clown Posse, his mother, his wife&#133;), 
  his newest CD, The Marshall Mathers LP has brought him a tremendous amount of 
  criticism despite its multi-platinum status. Too many different groups and people 
  have been attacked: from Clinton to Sonny Bono to Versace. In response to a 
  barrage of public outcry, Mathers responds, &#147;I do say things that I think 
  will shock people&#133;but I don&#146;t know how long I&#146;m going to be on 
  this planet. So while I&#146;m here, I might as well make the most of it.&#148;<br>
  It&#146;s safe to say that if Eminem dropped out of the entertainment business 
  tonight, he would create enough stir to carry over until the next white rapper 
  from Detroit appears on the Billboard charts and TRL countdown. However, since 
  it&#146;s also not likely that this will happen, let me address the biggest 
  problem with Slim Shady&#146;s public problems. Though many of his lyrics are 
  undoubtedly offensive, they are also some of the most impressive in the hip-hop 
  world. His constant stream of menacing yet perfectly placed verses puts Eminem 
  atop both the pop charts and the &#147;underground&#148; music scene.<br>
  This is where the dilemma arises. While rap icons such as The Notorious B.I.G., 
  Method Man, and DMX have risen to the top of the hip-hop world, they haven&#146;t 
  entirely crossed over to the mainstream. However, their white counterpart has 
  become fully immersed in a sea of teenage pop fans who bring home his CDs and 
  play them over and over, while their parents read in the next room. All of a 
  sudden, a public outcry is heard because of the offensive lyrics that Shady 
  is pumping into children&#146;s ears.<br>
  With this outcry comes the inevitable volley of accusations and defenses. The 
  latest and most potable complaints have come recently from the Gay/Lesbian Alliance 
  Against Defamation. GLAAD executive director, Joan M. Gerry states, &#147;The 
  Marshall Mathers LP contains the most blatantly offensive homophobic lyrics 
  GLAAD has ever seen.&#148; While the First Amendment rightfully shields Eminem 
  from complaints from the outside world, his own seemingly invincible armor has 
  become dinged up in the argument.<br>
  Mathers was quoted in his defense as saying, &#147;&#146;Faggot to me doesn&#146;t 
  necessarily mean gay people&#133;when I started saying &#145;faggot,&#146; I 
  started getting people going. [They said] &#145;You have something against gay 
  people&#146; and I thought it was funny, because I don&#146;t.&#148; Yet, when 
  you listen to the lyrics in many of his songs, it&#146;s clear that this is 
  not the case. The poster-verse for GLAAD&#146;s argument go a little something 
  like this: MY WORDS ARE LIKE A DAGGER WITH A JAGGED EDGE// THAT&#146;LL STAB 
  YOU IN THE HEAD WHETHER YOU&#146;RE A FAG OR LES// OR A HOMOSEX, HERMAPH// OR 
  A TRANS-A-VES// PANTS OR DRESS// HATE FAGS?// THE ANSWER&#146;S YES. <br>
  To his friends, colleagues and hip-hop heads, Eminem constantly maintains that 
  he says exactly what he thinks; what comes out in the recording studio is what 
  runs through his head. Yet when he is interviewed by the pop-culture media, 
  he skirts around the issues or replies that he has the right to create a stage 
  persona. When asked about his Slim Shady LP track, &#147;&#146;97 Bonnie &amp; 
  Clyde&#148; (in which he murders his wife and steals their baby), Mathers replied, 
  &#147;Me and Kim have a special relation. She knows when I&#146;m just fuckin&#146; 
  around on stage. She can tell that I&#146;m only doing it for fun.&#148; <br>
  If this indeed is true, then Eminem should not claim to be &#147;sharing [his] 
  point with the world&#148; if his lyrics are based on stories he has made up 
  in order to create more record sales. Though his lyrical wizardry is undisputed, 
  his responses to the media are generally different from what he puts down on 
  his tracks and relays to his close circle of hip-hop friends. This takes something 
  away from his hardcore persona, and puts him somewhere between rap icon and 
  showman extra-ordinaire.</p>

<h3>The rambling senior heads off, somewhere<br>
</h3>
<h5>BY PEDRO SALOM<br>
</h5>
<p>It recently dawned on me that I am indeed graduating in a few short weeks, 
  barring serious academic collapse. It&#146;s been four years. Holy shit. Wait, 
  I can&#146;t say that.<br>
  I arrived in Brunswick in the fall of 1996. It was a sunny day and I was a scrawny, 
  dorky looking kid with glasses and no fashion sense, struggling to grow his 
  hair out. Now I have blossomed into quite the stud.<br>
  I&#146;m sure you are all asking yourselves, &#147;What&#146;s Pedro doing next 
  year?&#148; I know I&#146;m asking that question. With a Bowdoin degree under 
  my belt, the world is my oyster, whatever the hell that means. But I have two 
  conditions that guide my future. They are my desire not to work in an office 
  and my need not to live at home. So without any further pomp and circumstance, 
  it&#146;s time to present my top three plans for the next chapter in the life 
  of Pedro.<br>
  I have been working for the Orient in some capacity every semester that I have 
  been at Bowdoin. It&#146;s a bit scary to say, but I am really going to miss 
  it. Ah, the memories. &#147;Bowdoin&#146;s identity may lie in expelling women,&#148; 
  &#147;Victory at Columbine,&#148; &#147;Let the flag fly.&#148; And those are 
  just the headlines. <br>
  There is something about the profession that appeals to me. I can&#146;t quite 
  put my finger on it, but it revolves around the fact that I enjoy writing for 
  an audience. I enjoy soliciting responses, and inspiring discussion. I enjoy 
  pissing people off. Of the hundreds of pages I have typed over the past four 
  years, I have put much more consideration into what is read by my peers rather 
  than what is read by my professors. Sure, this may not be the best strategy 
  for anyone looking to graduate cum laude, but who cares? I have received the 
  greatest comment I could hope for, &#147;I can&#146;t believe you wrote that.&#148;<br>
  Now the life of an aspiring columnist is not fun-filled. Syndication scares 
  me. Perhaps some of you gourmets out there in readers&#146; land have glanced 
  at one of my restaurant reviews. Now those I enjoy. They combine my love of 
  writing with my love of dining out. Unfortunately, my parents smoked throughout 
  my childhood, and I fear that my taste buds are much too dulled to truly sample 
  the subtleties of gourmet meals. <br>
  Regardless, journalism is a possibility. I am a procrastinator by nature and 
  have based much of my academic career on writing under time constraints. I love 
  the idea of people reading what I think they should know or think. Maybe it&#146;s 
  a power trip.<br>
  And on to the second path. I have spent the past four summers and a few winter 
  breaks working in restaurants, and have found that I love the art of hospitality. 
  While washing dishes was a bit too menial to turn into a career, I found my 
  niche in running the door. The mid-priced restaurant-microbrewery might just 
  be the home for me.<br>
  While home over Spring Break, I paid visits to a few friends I have worked with 
  and for, and had offers of management positions. Of course in this business 
  that could mean $9 an hour or 75 hour weeks at $30K a year. But if I like it, 
  is that enough? Perhaps for a few years, but that&#146;s pushing it. I&#146;ve 
  seen people get sucked into the business, and it&#146;s not pretty. Though casinos 
  still appeal to me&#133;<br>
  I have a vision of taking a bus out to Vegas and taking any hospitality job 
  I can get, and living by the seat of my pants for a few years. I had a friend 
  for whom I washed dishes several years ago. I remember him sharing is sage-like 
  advice. &#147;Pete, the best thing about cooking, is that I can pick up and 
  move anywhere in the country and have a job in 12 hours.&#148;<br>
  Rereading what I&#146;ve written, I realize that I have been painfully dull, 
  and you have my apologies for putting up with me, or my congratulations for 
  sticking it out so long. You pick whichever, depending on your mood.<br>
  The most off-the-wall option I have been considering is the military. Not many 
  kids from Bowdoin find their way into the enlisted ranks, which is a shame. 
  My military plan involves my joining the navy and finding myself in the Mediterranean 
  a year from now, operating sonar or weapons systems on a fast attack submarine.<br>
  Of all the answers I have given to the perennial, &#147;What are you doing next 
  year?&#148; this answer always draws the most criticism. There is a general 
  disdain for the armed forces among many of my peers, which is most unfortunate. 
  I have several reasons for pursuing this type of lifestyle for myself, at least 
  for a few years. <br>
  First of all is the superficial; I like the idea of being able to spend every 
  cent I&#146;m worth, and still have a roof over my head and food in my tummy 
  at the end of the day. There is a sense of duty that strikes me every now and 
  then. Many of my relatives have found themselves in the military for a few years 
  both in times of war and times of peace, and I would hate to break the tradition.<br>
  Above all, I see the military as a chance to continue my education. I&#146;m 
  not talking about learning the proper way to salute and how to make a bed that 
  quarters will bounce off of. I have led a very sheltered life thus far, and 
  enlisting would expose me to types of people I have not had the opportunity 
  to get to know. I see the military as a way to become a minority in several 
  ways for the first time in my life.<br>
  So there you have it. Don&#146;t ask me what I&#146;m doing; take a guess. It 
  could be a small town paper, it could be Vegas, it could be the Mediterranean. 
  But whatever happens, you won&#146;t run into me on the streets of Boston.</p>
<p><i>Pedro is really cool.</i></p>

  Big Top brings New York style to Brunswick<br>
</h3>
<h5>BY GREG T. SPIELBERG<br>
</h5>
<p>I called with a request in mind, which I wasn&#146;t sure would be fulfilled. 
  I knew they&#146;d be closing at four, and would most likely want to shut down 
  at 3:59 like most other eating establishments. The phone rang once and a half, 
  and as the other side picked up, I heard the trailing off from an in-house order, 
  &#147;Cordon Bleu&#133;,&#148; followed by the familiar &#147;Hello, Big Top.&#148; 
  Though I was aware of the closing time, I had been talking and thinking about 
  getting a sandwich and salad since about 2 a.m. the night before. I ordered 
  a bagel with lox and cream cheese and a caesar salad with extra dressing, and 
  told the voice on the other side that I had class till four. He took my order 
  graciously when I said I&#146;d be there as soon as possible, but in a comment 
  that surprised me, the owner replied, &#147;Don&#146;t worry about it. If you&#146;re 
  not here we&#146;ll put it by the doorstep and you can pay tomorrow.&#148; In 
  a time when it seems to be up front or not at all, it just caught me off guard.<br>
  But it really shouldn&#146;t have; that&#146;s just the way they run things 
  down at Big Top. They&#146;ve been doing it ever since 1995. No one&#146;s really 
  sure what stood at 70 Maine Street in the past, but since Alex Ho and Michael 
  Kunhardt decided to open the New York-style delicatessen, it hasn&#146;t mattered. 
  While their sandwich creations are often elaborate, the origins of Big Top are 
  quite simple. Kunhardt wanted to start a business in the Big Apple, but his 
  partner favored Colorado. In a compromise which has proved beneficial for Brunswick 
  residents, they settled in Maine. Ho, 30, said, &#147;We parked at Christy&#146;s, 
  had a few beers at Joshua&#146;s and just decided, &#145;let&#146;s have it 
  here.&#146;&#148; He also added that Bowdoin was a great influence in establishing 
  Big Top at its present location, saying, &#147;the students definitely help 
  on weekends.&#148;<br>
  Unlike its foundation, Big Top&#146;s name and design has more of a background. 
  After Michael Kunhardt and his family finished working on a PBS documentary 
  involving circus life and history, he kept the various memorabilia. Much of 
  the pictures, news articles and old photographs now adorn the interior walls, 
  and the television program serves as the basis for the establishment&#146;s 
  name. With Ho&#146;s knowledge for running a business, and Kunhardt&#146;s paraphernalia, 
  70th Maine has become a town favorite.<br>
  Big Top has been named Midcoast Maine&#146;s Best Deli/Sandwich Shop (Market 
  Surveys of America) for three years running, but it&#146;s not your classic 
  &#147;order and go&#148; place. While some may take their food elsewhere, many 
  customers enjoy the laid back atmosphere at one of the ten tables or numerous 
  stool seats overlooking the center of town. The walls are well decorated, and 
  fit perfectly under the name, Big Top. On your immediate left is a black and 
  white image of P.T. Barnum, flanked by an article written on the circus magnate. 
  Around the deli can be found an assortment of other framed photos or illustrations; 
  from the Golden Gate Park and Ringling Bros. &amp; Barnum &amp; Bailey to an 
  1873 shot of Maine Street. Towards the rear, a wavy mirror contorts anyone who 
  walks by the corridor. Another aspect of the deli that separates it from others 
  and adds to the atmosphere is the preparation area. Instead of closing it off 
  from view, a low counter opens up half the floor and allows clientele to see 
  what is being prepared. <br>
  It&#146;s likely that other sandwich shop owners would like to take a peek at 
  what goes on at the cutting boards and meat slicers. Whether it&#146;s a simple 
  sandwich, or a quarter-pound burger, patrons are continually satisfied and thinking 
  about seconds. Although Ho recommends, &#147;anything,&#148; some more specific 
  suggestions should be added for the Big Top beginner. For the basic palate, 
  an egg salad sandwich on a Kaiser roll does wonders; in an alteration from this 
  traditional selection, I&#146;d recommend slices of (fresh daily) avocado on 
  top. As a Long Islander, the bagels with cream cheese and lox (complete with 
  capers) are truly New York-style, and the caesar salad competes with any sit-down 
  restaurant I&#146;ve been to.<br>
  Some more exclusive Big Top creations have names to match. Scanning the colorful 
  chalkboard menu, one will find titles such as The Trapeze, Jenny Lind, Tightrope, 
  Oliphant, and The Rockies. Other favorites include the Tom Thumb, which at $2.50 
  is probably the best bargain there (it includes fried egg, avocado, tomato, 
  mayo and salt and pepper on a toasted English muffin); The Goose (turkey, muenster 
  cheese, honey mustard dressing, avocado on a 7&#148; or 12&#148; wedge); and 
  The Nick (a footlong hot roast beef with hot peppers, provolone cheese, tomatoes 
  and mayonnaise). The soups change three times a week, new sandwich creations 
  change daily, and a pickle and chips are included with every order. A number 
  of soft drink coolers can be found standing on the black and white checkered 
  floor, containing Snapple, a variety of sodas, and of course Fresh Samanthas. 
  Jaime Nichols &#146;03 says, &#147;Even though I&#146;m twenty, I still can&#146;t 
  resist Samantha&#146;s smile. I get three or four every time I eat there.&#148;<br>
  While the school year is coming to a close, reading period and Senior Week provide 
  plenty of sunny days. For a great meal&#151;and procrastination break&#151;walk 
  down to Big Top and order one of their hundred menu selections, or create one 
  of your own. They&#146;ll call you by name, bring the food outside on wicker 
  baskets, and be there when you go back for seconds.<br>
