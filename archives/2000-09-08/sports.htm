<h3>Bears ready to rumble</h3>
<h5>JON DOLAN<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR </h5>
<p>Under Head Coach Tim Gilbride's direction the men's soccer team enjoyed its 
  most consistent success, including NCAA berths in 1997 and 1998 and a solid 
  7-5-2 season last year. Gilbride, however, stepped down as a varsity coach following 
  the 1999 season to focus on his responsibilities as men's basketball coach. 
  He will remain with the soccer program as the junior varsity coach. </p>
<p>Replacing Coach Gilbride is Brain Ainscough. Before coming to Bowdoin, Coach 
  Ainscough had stints as an assistant coach at both Villanova and Boston College 
  and as head coach at Providence College. </p>
<p>With Ainscough's intensity, a strong core of returning players, and an exciting 
  group of freshmen the team looks to build upon its solid 1999 performance.</p>
<p>Despite the loss of goalie Tom Casarella (who graduated last year holding more 
  than half the school's keeper records), the Poalr Bears will continue the tradition 
  of solid defense. Harrison Leong's experience last year and his hard work in 
  the off season will help provide reliable goalkeeping throughout the year. </p>
<p>While it remains to be seen how Ainscough will position his players, there 
  will be a solid defensive unit on front of Leong. Senior tri-captain and starting 
  sweeper Mike Eaton will anchor the defense. Junior Jeff Corsetti and sophomore 
  Kevin Folan are also returning from last season's back four. </p>
<p>The Bears will not be short on offense either. With another productive season 
  senior tri-captain Patrick Hultgren has a good opportunity to break the school's 
  all-time scoring record.</p>
<p>Joining Hultgren in the attack will be versatile juniors Pat Bracewell and 
  Dave Bulow as either forward of offensive-minded midfielders. Sophomore Bart 
  McMann will also look to build on his experience last year and contribute to 
  the attack. </p>
<p>The Bears open their season at home against Husson on Wednesday, September 
  13 at 4 o'clock. Their first conference game is next Saturday as they travel 
  to Williams. In what could promise to be important conference games, the team 
  plays Colby and Bates at home on October 21 and 25, respectively, before closing 
  out the regular season on the road against Wesleyan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Volleyball set for the season</h3>
<h5>MAIA LEE<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>At 9 a.m. tomorrow morning, the women's volleyball team will put on those knee 
  pads and get ready to play the first game of the season. For two weeks this 
  team of only ten women has been working hard to gain back some of the strength 
  they lost from last year's graduation.</p>
<p>Despite the loss of four starters, Coach Lynn Ruddy is optimistic. &quot;This 
  group has so much potential,&quot; she said. &quot;The newer members of the 
  team are rapidly gaining confidence under the leadership of our captains Jaime 
  Burnett '01 and Shanna Mitchell '01.&quot;</p>
<p>After waving goodbye to several veteran players last year, these senior captains 
  are now in the position to step up to the net and build new strength for the 
  upcoming season. A crew of strong sophomore hitters including Jessica Reuben, 
  Michelle Platt, Mara Caruso, and Rebecca Geehr return this fall stronger than 
  ever. </p>
<p>First years Erin Philipson and Bryony Heise have also joined the team and are 
  currently training to be setters; they will provide a solid backup for starting 
  setter and captain Shanna Mitchell '01. Captain Jaime Bennett '01, who is a 
  strong defensive hitter, looks forward to working together with these younger 
  players. &quot;I am excited to have everyone bring their individual strengths 
  to the team,&quot; she says. &quot;I know that we can all work together.&quot;</p>
<p>The women's volleyball squad is also welcoming the addition of Assistant Coach 
  Mike Connolly. Some of you may know him as Bowdoin's baseball coach but apparently, 
  he's also a hit with the volleyball team. &quot;Everyone likes him,&quot; said 
  Ruddy. &quot;He is working very hard to help the team with conditioning.&quot; 
  Together Coach Ruddy and Coach Connolly hope to build the team's confidence, 
  help them work to their potential, and blast through to the NESCAC Championships.</p>
<p>This year's playoffs will be especially exciting for the team because they 
  are going to be held right here at Bowdoin. &quot;Having the NESCACs here at 
  school gives us special incentive to defeat several strong teams,&quot; said 
  Geehr.</p>
<p>The Bates Bobcats may present a special challenge, entering the season with 
  returning senior Kate Hagstrom, 1999 NESCAC Player of the Year.</p>
<p>However, to our delight, Coach Ruddy feels that Bowdoin has a relatively good 
  chance against Colby this year. &quot;Though they return with four senior starters, 
  they have been very up and down lately.&quot; </p>
<p>This is great news for all you Polar Bear volleyball fans since the first Bowdoin-Colby 
  game will be held in Morrell Gym on the evening of September 20. It is also 
  the first home game in what promises to be a very exciting season.</p>

<h3>New and Improved!</h3>
<h5>JENNIFER LARALA<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>A new coach, new sailors, a new year; the already impressive sailing team has 
  set bigger goals this year. Thomas Sitzmann has taken over for MacGregor Gray, 
  who left an outstanding group of sailors for the new coach to work with. &quot;I'm 
  very impressed so far,&quot; said Sitzmann, who recently left his position as 
  assistant coach of the U.S. Naval Academy sailing team. &quot;Mac has obviously 
  done a great job. He has built the beginnings of a Division I level or a top 
  ten level program.&quot;</p>
<p>Sitzmann believes that the sailing program has great potentialand wants to 
  make it the best in New England. Although Bowdoin may not get to that level 
  in the coming season, Sitzmann is determined to make it happen. For this year, 
  he's aiming for a top five ranking in NEISA (New England Intercollegiate Sailing 
  Association). </p>
<p>Sitzmann's reputation as a top sailor and coach should bring in some impressive 
  recruits in the coming years. As the coach says, he has already been &quot;inundated 
  with interest&quot; from prospective Bowdoin students. It looks as if the Polar 
  Bear sailing team has embarked upon a journey that will take Bowdoin to a whole 
  new level of competitiveness.</p>
<p>Although there is plenty of work ahead, the sailors are enthusiastic about 
  the future of their team as well as their new coach. Seniortri-captain C. W. 
  Estoff speaks for the team: &quot;The team is very happy with him. Everyone's 
  getting so much better so fast.&quot; </p>
<p>Estoff and fellow captains Kate Mendenhall '01 and Bridgid O'Connor '02 have 
  set high goals for themselves and for their squad. Sitzmann is particularly 
  impressed with the senior class for making the transition between coaches go 
  smoothly for everyone. This year's seniors are Oren Abeles, Melissa Bailey, 
  Jace Brown, Holly Noble, Kevin Oh, Mitch O'Neill, Mendenhall, and Estoff.</p>
<p>Many of the sailors are very similar in ability, so there should be a steady 
  string of great performances this season. Mitch O'Neill is off to an impressive 
  start, and Melissa Bailey is beginning what should be a great season as crew.</p>
<p>The strong sophomore class is led by Ryan Cauley and crew Melanie Keene; Laura 
  Windecker and crew Heather Honiss; and by Allison Binkowski and crew Tiana Gierke.</p>
<p>The freshman class includes experienced sailors and newcomers, many of whom 
  show considerable promise. Ben Peterson, Lizzy Jones, and Katy Adikes are expected 
  to make great contributions to the team.</p>
<p>Rising freshman star Steve Lampert will attempt to fill the shoes of his brother, 
  Mike Lampert '00, one of Bowdoin's key losses. Other important team members 
  lost to graduation are Josh Helfat and Dave Anderson. </p>
<p>This weekend, Bowdoin will be sending two boats to each of four regattas. Sailors 
  will compete at Maine Maritime, Dartmouth, Tufts, and UNH. For anyone hoping 
  to catch some nearby sailing action, the team will be competing at Maine Maritime 
  on September 9th, 23rd-24th, and 30th. Bowdoin sailors will also be racing at 
  USM on October 7th and 14th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Crew team in top form at start of season</h3>
<h5>J.P. BOX<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>After completing a tremendously successful spring, the men's and women's crew 
  teams look forward to the upcoming fall season in which they will compete against 
  Division 1 powerhouses and Olympic hopefuls.</p>
<p>The highlight of last spring's competition was Bowdoin's impressive showing 
  at the Dad Vail Regatta in Philadelphia. In this 2K coxed-four event, Bowdoin 
  entered five boats (three women and two men).</p>
<p>Both the first men's and women's boats made it to the finals while competing 
  against stiff competition. The men rowed to a five second victory, securing 
  the championship, while the women finished strong in third place. At the champs' 
  heels were the University of Michigan, Georgia Tech, and other Division I notables.</p>
<p>Also, the women's novice boat surged forward until they were stopped in the 
  semifinals. Said Tom Scifres '03, who rowed on the novice boat as a freshman, 
  &quot;crew is really an amazing sport because it is the only sport where Bowdoin 
  can compete against D I schools.&quot;</p>
<p>Not only did Bowdoin fare well in the Dad Vail, but they proved to be a potent 
  force throughout the season. The first men's boat, comprised of Will LoVerme 
  '02, Will Colvin '00, Dave Thomas '00, Gordon Clark '03, and coxswained by mary 
  Minor '02, also added the New England Championships and the New England 4s Championship 
  to their list of accomplishments.</p>
<p>The first women's boat, rowed by Kelly Ricciardi '01, Erin Jaworski '01, Abby 
  Lockwood '01, Lindsey Sortor '02, and coxswained by Katie Smith '03, finished 
  second in the New England Championships and claimed the top spot at the New 
  England 4s championship.</p>
<p>After the impressive showing in the spring, the men's season continued as their 
  victory at the Dad Vail propelled them to the Henry Royal Regatta in London, 
  arguably the most prestigious crew event in the world. The setup at the Henley 
  Royal differs from the traditional events as 64 boats must qualify for 32 spots 
  in a single elimination tournament.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bowdoin faced an extremely difficult first round opponent in 
  the London Rowing Club, a feeder for the English National Team. Despite applying 
  steady pressure on the favored Club, Bowdoin was bested by a mere 3/4 of a boat 
  length or approximately one second. However, Bowdoin's boys did make an appearance 
  in The London Times for their efforts and were referred to as the &quot;Americans&quot;. 
  No longer were they representing Bowdoin College, but the United States as a 
  whole.</p>
<p>In the upcoming year Bowdoin hopes to carry over their momentum and translate 
  it into more championships against some of New England's and the world's best 
  rowers. This fall, the men and women will compete at the 5K distance sporting 
  two men's varsity boats and two open weight women's boats as well as a light 
  weight women's boat.</p>
<p>The addition of a whopping 51 freshmen hoping to contribute makes this season 
  one of the most internally competitive years in history.</p>
<p>Although both the men and women are losing key contributors from their first 
  boats, they are confident that they will be replaced by competent and equally 
  determined athletes.</p>
<p>The men lose the recently graduated Will Colvin, the 6'9&quot; rowing machine, 
  and Dave Thomas, while the coxswain, Mary Minor '02, is studying away for the 
  semester. The women lose only one member of their first boat, Abby Lockwood, 
  who will be replaced by Erin Giggey '01.</p>
<p>At this point in the season, the crew team is preparing for its first event, 
  the Textile River Regatta, on October 1. A week later, the Colby, Bates, Bowdoin 
  Regatta will take place with school pride burning and a chance to claim crew 
  supremacy amongst these rivals.</p>
<p>However, the biggest fall regatta is the Head of the Charles in Cambridge, 
  Massachusetts which captain Will LoVerme described as the &quot;Super Bowl&quot; 
  of crew in North America. Unfortunately, Lo Verme and the men's crew will not 
  be able to compete at the competition because only one qualifying bid, secured 
  by the women, can be sent to each school.</p>
<p>The women's crew team is raring at the possibility of competing in the coxed-four 
  event against schools such as Harvard and Yale as well as national teams from 
  Germany, Canada, and the U.S. &quot;We will be able to watch our competition 
  on ESPN,&quot; boasted co-captain Erin Jaworski.</p>
<p>Although the initial setback of not being able to race in the Head of the Charles 
  frustrates the men, they still remain upbeat about the fall and are already 
  looking forward to the spring.</p>
<p>Said LoVerme, &quot;Despite the disappointment of not rowing in the Charles, 
  hopefully this year will be a continuation of last year's success and an attempt 
  to defend the New England Championships and the Dad Vail titles in the spring.&quot;</p>

<h3>Water Polo gears up for battle with Bates, Colby</h3>
<h5>LAUREN BROOKE McNALLY<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>When I tell someone that I play water polo, I usually recieve one of two reactions: 
  first, a blank facial expression that indicates, &quot;what the hell is water 
  polo?&quot;, and second, &quot;we have a water polo team??&quot;</p>
<p>Unless you're from the west coast, it's pretty unlikely that your high school 
  had a water polo team, and even more unlikely that you actually sat through 
  a game. It's not your fault. Water polo is just not that popular a sport among 
  small east coast towns. </p>
<p>However, the excuse that the pool is &quot;just too hot to sit in,&quot; &quot;reeks 
  of chlorine&quot;, or, my personal favorite, &quot;there are too many guys in 
  Speedos walking around&quot; is not a good enough explanation to neglect watching 
  the Bowdoin water polo team in action.</p>
<p>They're smart, they're slick, and they're SEXY. They also happened to have 
  had a terrific season last fall. Out of three tournaments, Bowdoin lost only 
  once, and they not only hosted Division III club nationals, but managed to place 
  third.</p>
<p>The Polar Bears lost several significant starters to graduation, injury, and... 
  the FOOTBALL team. Five key starters- Charles Gray, Stew Mackie, Tim Hayes, 
  David &quot;Ferris&quot; Lawrence, and Scott Fujimoto- graduated this spring. 
  Another starter, Matt Loosigian '03, is out this fall with a shoulder injury, 
  while Nick Driskill '02 decided to play football.</p>
<p>Yet the Polar Bears have significant depth from the bench waiting to step up 
  and take on starting positions. Captains Erin Veenker '01, Dave Frank '02, and 
  Nate &quot;Big Guns&quot; Kosub '02 all bring experience and leadership to the 
  team. John Clifford '02, Dave Harden '03 and Robie Anson '03 show fresh talent 
  and will be crucial players in tournaments this fall.</p>
<p>Several first years have also expressed interest in playing polo for Bowdoin. 
  Alex DeRubira '04 and Chris Choi '04 are both experienced players from the west 
  coast, while Lynn Furick '04, Gillian '04, Abbie Perelman '04, Jenifer Montalvo 
  '04, and Becky Grossman '04 will deepen the team's lineup. Jeff Tillingest '04 
  brings extensive experience to the goal. </p>
<p>Bowdoin will play at Holy Cross for the first tournament of the fall on September 
  15 and 16. Perennial rivals Colby and Bates will also be in attendance.</p>
<p>Captain Nate Kosub states, &quot;I'm really excited about this fall. We're 
  in much better shape physically than we were last year. We're also sexier.&quot;</p>
<p>The Polar Bears also have a coach this year. In the past, the team captains 
  have always coached water polo. Burcay Gurcan, a graduate of RIT and a native 
  of Turkey, generously gave the team technical advice last season as the coach.</p>
<p>&quot;Burcay has a lot of experience playing water polo. He's going to be invaluable 
  to us as our captain this year,&quot; says captain Erin Veenker. </p>
<p>Although the Bears have lost a lot of depth, this season promises to be exciting, 
  challenging, and rewarding. &quot;I have a feeling that a lot of people are 
  going to step up this season,&quot; says Kosub. So for all the non-water polo 
  fans out there: start keeping track of the team. This season, the Polar Bears 
  should prove once again that they are one of the nation's best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Women's soccer: Bears prepare for season</h3>
<h5>COLLEEN MATHEWS<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>For the past several weeks, during double sessions and 6 a.m. practices, the 
  women's soccer team has focused on opening day. The Polar Bears begin their 
  season with high expectations for September 9. This team is not concerned with 
  whispers of a sixth straight NCAA appearance. Instead, it is concentrating on 
  tomorrow's game and every day between now and the post-season.</p>
<p>The 1999 season was an amazing year for the team. Coach John Cullen and his 
  squad participated in Bowdoin's fifth straight NCAA Division III tournament. 
  In the first round, the Polar Bears defeated Farmingham State2-0, giving Bowdoin 
  its first-ever national tournament win.</p>
<p>Williams, in the second round, scored in the final minute of play to defeat 
  Bowdoin 1-0. Despite the loss, the women's soccer team finished the season with 
  the outstanding record of 13-3.</p>
<p>Senior quad-captains Kim Bohlin, Allison Farmer, Sarah Farmer, and Molly Perencevich 
  will lead the 2000 team. Returning this year are seventeen players, including 
  nine starters. Sarah Farmer '01, one of the region's best goalies, will return 
  to the net, while veteran players Diana Blazer '01, Kim Bohlin '01, Abby Lockwood 
  '01, and Katie Sheridan '02 will protect Farmer. The midfield will be controlled 
  by Kate Walz '01, while Alison Lavoie '02 will lead the attack. Bohlin, Lockwood, 
  A. Farmer, and Lavoie were 1999 all-region selections. Caroline Budney '03 and 
  Shelly Chessie '03 were non-starters last year, but they were two of Bowdoin's 
  top scorers. This season, the pair should expect to move into the starting lineup. 
  Coach Cullen describes the veterans as players who &quot;know what needs to 
  be done.&quot; </p>
<p>Monday, the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) released 
  the women's preseason polls. Bowdoin is ranked fourth in the New England region- 
  behind Williams, Western Connecticut, and Wheaton- while Bates and Colby are 
  12th and 13th respectively. While fans are looking to the playoffs, Bowdoin 
  is focused on the regular season.</p>
<p>Coach Cullen said the Polar Bears' only goal was &quot;to work hard today.&quot; 
  Sarah Farmer believes that the team's commitment to daily improvement, along 
  with the combination of talent, enthusiasm, and experience will prepare it for 
  both regular and post-season play. She also said, &quot;this season the question 
  isn't how good we are, it's how good do we want to be.&quot;</p>
<p>For Bowdoin to return to the NCAA Tournament, it must win the New England Small 
  College Atheletic Conference (NESCAC) championship. </p>
<p>This weekend, Bowdoin will begin to answer the question &quot;how good they 
  want to be.&quot; The 2000 regular season opens tomorrow in Massachusetts, when 
  the Polar Bears take on Bridgewater State.</p>
<p>The team's first home game will be played against the University of New England 
  on September 13 at 4 p.m. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>W. XC trains for season</h3>
<h5>CAIT FOWKES<br>
  CONTRIBUTOR</h5>
<p>The women's cross-country team is hard at work, training for another successful 
  season. This year's team is preparing to surpass last year's impressive ninth 
  place finish (out of 35) in the region. Head Coach Peter Slovenski displayed 
  a genuine confidence in attaining this goal. &quot;We want to be in the top 
  5 of our NESCAC championship, and to be in the top 6 in the region this fall. 
  We also want to win the state meet this year, and to do that we'll have to beat 
  Colby who beat us in every race last year.&quot;</p>
<p>The Polar Bears will be put to the test on September 23 at NYU for their first 
  meet. That will be the true test as to how well the rigorous hill and alternative 
  kayaking workouts have prepared them. Hopefully the women will prove strong 
  competition with Brandeis' and Amherst's nationally ranked teams. Other competition 
  Bowdoin will face is against Colby and Tufts. </p>
<p>This year's team will be led by senior captains Jeanne Bourdeau, Jesse Gray 
  and Erin Lyman. Last year's captain and number one runner, Vicky Shen, will 
  be a loss to the team. However, returning members Jesse Gray, Erin Lyman and 
  Libby Barney '03 will be the heart of the lineup. Of the top seven runners this 
  year, six will be returning and, with the new talent evident in the freshman 
  class, this year's success should ensue. Good luck women! GO U BEARS!</p>
