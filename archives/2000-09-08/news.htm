<h3>Cohen awarded Bowdoin Prize<br>
</h3>
<h5>SUZANNE REIDER &amp; ANNA DORNBUSCH<br>
  EDITORS IN CHIEF</h5>
<p>This past Thursday, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen was awarded the Bowdoin 
  Prize, Bowdoin&#146;s highest honor. Though Secretary Cohen spends the majority 
  of his time dealing with issues of international concern, in his acceptance 
  speech, Secretary Cohen spoke not of his days in the Pentagon, but rather, of 
  his days at Bowdoin. <br>
  The Bowdoin Prize, awarded once every five years, is bestowed upon &#147;the 
  graduate or former member of the College or member of its faculty at the time 
  of the award, who shall have made during the period the most distinctive contribution 
  in any field of human endeavor.&#148; <br>
  Past recipients include former Senator George Mitchell &#145;54 and Olympic 
  gold medallist Joan Benoit Samuelson &#146;79. Secretary Cohen entered Bowdoin 
  in 1958, coming from Bangor Maine, where his family owned and operated a bakery. 
  During his first year at Bowdoin, Secretary Cohen excelled on the basketball 
  court. <br>
  His athletic success would continue throughout his collegiate career, culminating 
  in his participation on the New England Hall of Fame team. During his acceptance 
  speech, Secretary Cohen acknowledged that, upon entering Bowdoin, he was a &#147;jock&#148; 
  in every sense of the word. <br>
  While he found athletic success rather easily, Secretary Cohen initially struggled 
  to develop the intellectual fervor that he began to cultivate when confronted 
  by former English Professor Gleason who insisted that Secretary Cohen, like 
  the rest of his class, write a sonnet. <br>
  As Secretary Cohen told the crowd this past Thursday evening, at the time, he 
  contested Gleason&#146;s request, claiming, &#147;Real men don&#146;t write 
  poetry.&#148; In fact, up until that point, Secretary Cohen admitted he had 
  yet to even open a book of poetry. However, under the guidance of Gleason, Secretary 
  Cohen came to value the influence of poetry and literature, and as he stated, 
  learned how to &#147;open up my mind.&#148; <br>
  Since writing that initial sonnet during his first year at Bowdoin, Secretary 
  Cohen has authored or co-authored nine books, including works of fiction, poetry 
  and writing of a political nature. Secretary Cohen&#146;s interest in language 
  expanded during his time at Bowdoin, where he completed a Latin major, receiving 
  High Honors. <br>
  After leaving Bowdoin, he earned his L.L.B at Boston University Law School and 
  returned to Bangor to practice. He was elected to public office in 1969, when 
  he was awarded a seat on the Bangor City Council. Two years later, he was elected 
  the Mayor of Bangor. When he decided to run in his first Congressional campaign, 
  inspired by the idea of a Bowdoin student, he set out to march 600 miles across 
  his congressional district in Maine. <br>
  His physical labor paid off when he was elected to his first of three terms 
  in the House of Representatives. During his tenure, he served on the Judiciary 
  Committee. Though a young Congressman, he soon gained national attention when 
  he broke with party lines and voted against Nixon in the Watergate hearings. 
  <br>
  In taking such a bold stance in the hearings, he was nationally recognized as 
  an independent thinker in a highly partisan Congress. This past Thursday, Secretary 
  Cohen commented on the importance of independent thinking when he addressed 
  students in the crowd, urging them to &#147;always listen to your conscience 
  and not to the crowd.&#148; <br>
  After three terms in the House of Representatives, Secretary Cohen entered the 
  Senate in 1979, where he served on the Armed Services Committee and became a 
  leader in issues of defense and national security. Secretary Cohen left the 
  Senate after serving three terms, disappointed in the partisan nature of Congress. 
  <br>
  Upon his departure, President Clinton asked him to serve as his Secretary of 
  Defense. <br>
  In accepting the Bowdoin Prize, Secretary Cohen recounted his initial feelings 
  of shock when he received the phone call from President Clinton. &#147;Why me?&#148; 
  Secretary Cohen wondered. <br>
  President Clinton, like Secretary Cohen, wanted to transcend party lines, especially 
  in the area of national security. By appointing a Republican Secretary of Defense 
  to a Democratic administration, President Clinton was able to show that there 
  are no party lines in issues of national security. <br>
  In talking with Secretary Cohen, he cited his four years as Secretary of Defense 
  as his most rewarding and purposeful experience in public service. <br>
  However, in recounting the most important four years in his academic development, 
  he described his years at Bowdoin. He credits Bowdoin with opening his mind 
  and influencing the spirit and philosophy that has shaped his life. </p>

<h3>Bowdoin rises in rankings, falls in faculty resources</h3>
<h5>COREY FRIEDMAN<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>
</h5>
<p>When U.S. News and World Report&#146;s annual college rankings were released 
  last week, Bowdoin had climbed from ninth place to sixth under the category 
  of national liberal arts colleges. The excitement of the jump, however, was 
  dampened by the fact that the sixth place position was shared with Carleton, 
  Haverford, and Middlebury. <br>
  According to the admissions department, the school&#146;s position at sixth 
  place is good news. Vice President for Admissions &amp; Student Aid Richard 
  Steele said that U.S. News&#146;s college ranking is a way of reaching students 
  who might not otherwise have heard of Bowdoin.<br>
  International students in particular may look to the rankings as a source of 
  information on American colleges and universities. To students in developing 
  countries with no access to college counseling, resources of this kind can be 
  influential in the process of selecting a school. <br>
  But even students within the United States pay attention to the rankings, Steele 
  said. &#147;The public is starved for objective information about [college] 
  quality.&#148;<br>
  The objectiveness of U.S. News&#146;s system has recently come under fire, however. 
  Twenty-five percent of a school&#146;s rank is based on the fairly subjective 
  category of reputation, as determined by a survey of academic officials from 
  similar institutions. <br>
  The latest issue of the Washington Monthly discusses a report on the college 
  rankings by the National Opinion Research Council, commissioned by U.S. News 
  in 1997. The report, published in full on the Washington Monthly web site, claims 
  that &#147;&#133; the weights used to combine various measures into an overall 
  rating lacks any defensible empirical or theoretical basis.&#148; <br>
  But regardless of the accuracy of the ratings, the popularity of U.S. News&#146;s 
  college issue means that schools must at the very least remain conscious of 
  their standing in the rankings. <br>
  When asked whether the rankings have affected admissions policy at Bowdoin, 
  Steele said, &#147;I think we have bent over backwards to make sure that basic 
  educational policy is not shaped artificially by the results of a survey that 
  we know is imperfect.&#148; <br>
  Despite improvements over the past year to the student-faculty ratio, Bowdoin 
  did particularly poorly in the area of faculty resources, dropping seven places. 
  The low score of 57 stood out among Bowdoin&#146;s otherwise high rankings.<br>
  U.S. News determines the faculty resources rank according to the variables of 
  class size, average professor salary, student faculty ratio, and percentage 
  of faculty that work full time. <br>
  According to Dean for Academic Affairs Craig McEwen, what hurt Bowdoin was the 
  average salary statistic, which accounts for 35% of the faculty resources score. 
  The College has had a growth in the number of professors during the past ten 
  years, and &#147;because we have proportionally more new faculty at the assistant 
  professor level, our average salary is lower,&#148; McEwen explained, calling 
  U.S. News&#146;s methods &#147;misleading and not very representative.&#148; 
  <br>
  In addition to its overall rank, Bowdoin appeared in separate sections ranking 
  the liberal arts colleges with the highest graduation rates and greatest selectivity, 
  coming in fifth and seventh place respectively. </p>

<h3>Former controller embezzles $50,000<br>
</h3>
<h5>NIMA SOLTANZAD<br>
  STAFF WRITER</h5>
<p>Bowdoin College is suing Gary A. Plante, the College&#146;s former controller, 
  for embezzling $50,545.59 from the school. According to the civil lawsuit, Plante 
  opened a Bowdoin bank account at Maine Bank &amp; Trust and transferred funds 
  from it into another account. The suit was filed on July 3 in Cumberland County 
  Superior Court.<br>
  &#147;Although the account was authorized to be opened,&#148; writes Gerry Boothby, 
  associate treasurer of the College, in an affidavit filed with the lawsuit, 
  &#147;Gary opened the account and used a signature stamp of Kent Chabotar as 
  treasurer without Bowdoin&#146;s authorization and set up the account so that 
  only one signature was required for all transactions when, in general, Bowdoin&#146;s 
  bank accounts require two signatures for transactions&#133;over $5,000.&#148; 
  <br>
  Plante had Maine Bank &amp; Trust issue three treasurer&#146;s checks to Polar 
  Bear Investments and subsequently deposited the checks into a bank account at 
  People&#146;s Heritage Bank. He ultimately withdrew the funds and used them 
  in part to make a down payment on a home in Lewiston. <br>
  Plante also used a credit card issued jointly in his name and Bowdoin&#146;s 
  for personal benefit. Though he was authorized to use the card for legitimate 
  purchases or expenses on behalf of the College, Plante purchased furniture on 
  the card for $1,698.92 from a company called Lizell and had it delivered to 
  his home this spring. <br>
  He also charged $449.46 in personal expenses to Bowdoin while on a trip to Las 
  Vegas in March of 2000 and the $150 registration fee for his girlfriend at the 
  annual meeting of the Eastern Association of College and University Business 
  Officers in Montreal, Canada in August of 1999.<br>
  Plante, who was promoted to the position of controller in March of 1999, declined 
  to comment on the situation. <br>
  According to Boothby, however, &#147;Gary admitted to embezzling monies from 
  Bowdoin&#133;Gary told me that he had enormous pressure from a lot of sources 
  and that he had not been thinking clearly. He also told me that he was so ashamed, 
  that he did not know what to say, that he felt terrible, that he would cooperate 
  fully and that he would get the money back to Bowdoin.&#148; <br>
  The College is demanding that Plante pay restitution, along with other damages, 
  such as costs and attorney&#146;s fees. <br>
  To date, he has not made any repayment to Bowdoin. Police are continuing investigation 
  of the case to determine whether Plante has embezzled any other funds from the 
  school. <br>
  The Administration expects completion of the investigation in October or November.</p>

<h3>Student government elections to take place this weekend<br>
</h3>
<h5>HAI ANH VU<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>

<p>Candidates for student government positions will be in a state of excitement 
  throughout the weekend as Bowdoin students hit the polls. In addition to voting 
  for class officers, students will also be voting to fill a vacant position on 
  the Student Executive Board (SEB) as well as voting on a constitutional referendum.<br>
  As announced by the SEB, from Friday September 8 to Sunday September 10, the 
  student body of Bowdoin College will vote online (http://vote.bowdoin.edu) for 
  their class officers, including president, vice president, treasurer, community 
  service organizer, and class representative in congress.<br>
  This election will also coincide with an election for a vacant spot on the SEB 
  and a vote on a constitutional referendum. <br>
  The student government, comprised of the SEB and the Student Congress (formerly 
  known as the Student Assembly), is in charge of governing and representing the 
  student body at Bowdoin. This year, after much debate and hard work, the government 
  has decided to present a referendum to the constitution with the objective of 
  being &#147;...responsible for presenting student opinion to the administration, 
  chartering organizations, filling Faculty and Trustee committee student positions, 
  and supervising class officer elections.&#148; <br>
  On September 16, interviews will take place for the remaining eight positions 
  in the Student Congress. (Students who wish to run for these positions must 
  submit a letter of intent to the Smith Union information desk on Thursday, September 
  13.) This late election is a change from the last year&#146;s with an aim to 
  allow students ample time to consider the commitment of these positions.<br>
  Efforts have also been made by the student government to hold open and frequent 
  dialogue with the entire student body. Most prominent of all was the establishment 
  of the SEB&#146;s weekly office hours. <br>
  Starting this semester, every Tuesday and Wednesday, there will be SEB members 
  available at the Smith Union Conference Room to answer questions and help solve 
  problems that their fellow students might have during the week. <br>
  The SEB is hopeful that, through this function, students will be better aware 
  of the SEB&#146;s attempts to act as their voices to the Administration, faculty, 
  and the Board of Trustees. This is also a response to some recent surveys indicating 
  that the Student Government is inaccessible.<br>
  In conjunction with the office hours, the SEB has also set up a new website 
  of the student government featuring the names of members as well as updated 
  news of the student government. This website, www.bowdoin.edu/studorgs/exec, 
  was created from researching over 20 websites of student governments in universities 
  and colleges across the United States. <br>
  Headlines are updated weekly and interactive options are available, allowing 
  students to discuss on-campus issues directly with student government members. 
  <br>
  The SEB has been working diligently toward its ultimate goal to &#147;better 
  represent the students&#146; voices.&#148;<br>
  &#147;We want you to have trust in us and feel that we are working for you,&#148; 
  said Eric Diamon &#145;03, co-publicity officer of the SEB. &#147;At the same 
  time, your feedback is equally important. The executive board encourages all 
  students to do their part in creating more communication on campus. Please call, 
  e-mail us or come to meet us at any time.&#148;</p>

<h3>Brunswick proposes new street parking ordinance<br>
</h3>
<h5>ERIC CHAMBERS<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>
</h5>
<p>On September 18, the Brunswick Town Council will vote on a new parking ordinance 
  that will forbid parking on certain streets at night. <br>
  This new ordinance, if passed, will forbid parking between the hours of 1:00 
  a.m. and 6:00 a.m. every day at the following locations: the east side of Park 
  Row, between Bath Road and Longfellow Avenue; the north side of South Street, 
  between Coffin Street and Maine Street; both sides of Longfellow Avenue, between 
  Harpswell Road and Maine Street; and the west side of Maine Street, between 
  Nobel Street and Boody Street.<br>
  The Student Executive Board (SEB) has expressed their displeasure at the possible 
  ordinance.<br>
  &#147;The Student Executive Board believes that students should not have limited 
  access to parking on streets in the overnight hours,&#148; said Jeff Favolise 
  &#146;01, chair of the SEB. &#147;The surrounding campus roads provide extra 
  spots, and the ordinance puts even more pressure on an already difficult situation.&#148;<br>
  However, Director of Security Bruce Boucher expressed optimism about the ordinance. 
  &#147;I think the purpose of the ordinance is to prevent the clogging up of 
  the street by cars that park on those streets for days at a time. By forcing 
  these cars to move, they allow students, faculty, and staff the ability to park 
  until 1:00 A.M., when the [Hawthorne-Longfellow] library closes.&#148;<br>
  Favolise said he believes that the ordinance &#147;impacts every student. It 
  is essential that the student body becomes interested in this issue and makes 
  a strong push to open the roads for parking.&#148; He encourages students to 
  join the Student Executive Board at the Brunswick Town Council Meeting on September 
  18 to express their opinions on this issue. <br>
  Many of the current parking problems began last year, when all first years were 
  required to park in the lot on Stanwood Street due to the construction of Chamberlain 
  Hall. Originally on loan by the National Guard, the lot was reopened this year 
  in response to upperclassmen complaints of overcrowded lots and long walks to 
  their dorms and apartments. <br>
  Many first years, though, complained about the new lot&#146;s distance from 
  campus and its nightly closure, which prevented many from accessing their cars 
  when they needed to. This, in addition to poor lighting at the lot, resulted 
  in a general feeling of insecurity among the students. However, new security 
  measures have been implemented at the Stanwood lot in an effort to improve accessibility 
  and safety. New light fixtures and an improved shuttle service between the lot 
  and the campus provide extra security, and a card reader was installed to allow 
  students full access to their cars anytime with their Bowdoin ID. <br>
  Still, these improvements result in mixed feelings about the lot. Daniel Abraham 
  &#146;04 said that he felt that &#147;The lot is pretty far from campus, but 
  at least I feel safer with the shuttle service working.&#148;<br>
  Jasmine Cronin &#146;04 said she believed that &#147;the walk is a pain.&#148;<br>
  According to the Bowdoin College 2000-2001 Parking and Motor Vehicle Regulations, 
  all student-owned cars must be registered with Campus Security. A series of 
  decals is used to show the parking lot designations for each car. All first-year 
  students are required to show white decals and park in the Stanwood Street lot. 
  All sophomores and juniors living in dorms are required to show orange decals 
  and park at the Farley Field House. All seniors are required to show yellow 
  decals and park on Coffin Street or in front of their apartments. Violations 
  of these rules will result in the subsequent towing away of the vehicle, as 
  well as a fine.</p>
<h3><br>
  eRecruiting allows online career planning service<br>
</h3>
<h5>ANJALI DOTSON<br>
  STAFF WRITER<br>
</h5>
<p>Imagine being able to apply for an internship at the National Institute for 
  Health, sign up for a job interview, and prepare your resume all without leaving 
  your room. <br>
  With a new service implemented by the Career Planning Center (CPC), this is 
  now possible. <br>
  The CPC, in a venture with Experience Inc., has created a program in which students 
  can receive information on academic opportunities specifically geared toward 
  their interests. This program is called eRecruiting (also known as eBEAR).<br>
  The main purpose of this service is to keep students informed on opportunities 
  in a manner that is most manageable for them.<br>
  &#147;Students&#146; biorhythms are different than our office hours. When our 
  office is open isn&#146;t necessarily the most convenient time for students. 
  The service enables us to help you create your own unique information loop,&#148; 
  Career Planning Services Director Anne Shields said.<br>
  eRecruiting&#146;s primary function is to gather information on what students&#146; 
  current interests are based on a survey that each student fills out online that 
  in turn keeps them up-to-date on career-related information that matches their 
  specific interest(s). <br>
  One advantage of this new program is that a student will be able to customize 
  an account online to meet his or her changing interests. Each student&#146;s 
  account (which is set up after the completion of the online survey) will have 
  a password and therefore only that student will be able to retrieve the information 
  in his or her account. <br>
  Because it is so personalized, a student may change his or her interests online 
  as many times as he or she would like.<br>
  After filling out the survey, students can receive information on internships, 
  summer jobs, full-time employment, mentoring, scholarships, networking, employer 
  fellowships, and even grad school recruiting.<br>
  eRecruiting, while geared toward all Bowdoin students, is especially helpful 
  to seniors who are searching for post-graduation employment. For example, the 
  CPC runs on-campus recruiting programs in order to provide a link between students 
  and employers. Seniors can log onto eRecruiting ahead of time and see which 
  employers are coming to campus and for what jobs they are hiring.<br>
  While recruiting for employment is one of the program&#146;s main functions, 
  eRecruiting also provides students with the opportunity to upload and prepare 
  resumes and cover letters. Through the online program, students are able to 
  gear their resumes toward their specific area of interest by emphasizing achievements 
  in that area. In addition, students wishing to submit works of art, photographs, 
  or designs will be able to do so through eRecruiting. The process, once the 
  information is recorded, is quite manageable.<br>
  &#147;After a student completes a resume or cover letter through &#145;my documents,&#146; 
  the information can then be loaded on through a three-step process that takes 
  about 20 seconds,&#148; Shields said.<br>
  Not only is eRecruiting directly beneficial to students, but it also assists 
  the CPC in determining in which areas of study they need to focus their &#147;job-search&#148; 
  efforts.<br>
  &#147;It allows us to be in sync with the interests by using the information 
  given in the surveys to plan strategically for our office,&#148; Shields said.<br>
  With the simplicity of eRecruiting, there now exists a more efficient way for 
  students to handle job inquiries and career-related searches. In addition, this 
  service is multifaceted, allowing students to be more organized and responsible 
  with their job explorations.<br>
  &#147;Because of the [program&#146;s] versatility and wonder of technology, 
  it doesn&#146;t have to be only recruiting; students have total control over 
  what they do through eRecruiting,&#148; Shields said.<br>
