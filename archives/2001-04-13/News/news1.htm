      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon walking into the student union this past week, 
        it was hard to avoid some terrifying statistics about sexual violence.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe Space, the campus organization dedicated to the 
        support of survivors of sexual violence, had posted these statistics to 
        promote sexual assault awareness on campus during Sexual Assault Awareness 
        Week. Some of the posters proclaimed things such as "1.3 women are raped 
        a minute" and "78 rapes occur an hour." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only were statistics posted all over campus, but, 
        among other events, there was a speaker on pornography Tuesday night, 
        a breakfast at the Women's Resource Center Wednesday morning, and on Wednesday 
        night, there was a candle-light vigil for victims of sexual assault.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pornography speaker was one of the most well-attended 
        events. Both men and women filed into the Kresge auditorium to attend 
        the lecture by Dr. Gail Dines on pornography and the media. Every seat 
        was filled, leaving some people standing in the back. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One student at the lecture said, "This is a better turnout 
        than there has ever been for any sort of academic lecture." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dines's lecture focused on how pornography sexualizes 
        violence against women, and by sexualizing it, makes it invisible. In 
        addition, she showed slides while lecturing on the degradation of women 
        and the amount of violence in pornography. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactions to her lecture were broad. Many students 
        were impressed. Emily Scott '04 said, "I think it was something Bowdoin 
        really needed to hear…Bowdoin has a lack of radicalism on campus, and 
        I think that radicalism is an important part of college campus life as 
        the driving force of change for our generation…."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sena Phin '02, a member of Safe Space, said that she 
        thought the lecture was one of the most effective parts of the week. "I 
        agreed with some things and disagreed with a lot…but she actually made 
        people think about things. Just hearing people in the union talk about 
        sexual assault shows how effective the lecture was."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the lecture, many students also visited 
        a booth in the union where pieces of a quilt could be made to add to the 
        sexual assault quilt hanging outside the pub. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quilt has statements ranging from, "Men are assaulted 
        too…Remember," to "Education is the best defense." The quilt has been 
        expanding through the years and is a large part of promoting awareness.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Safe Space, the purpose of Sexual Assault 
        Awareness Week is to push students to walk away with more of an awareness 
        about how dominant of an issue sexual assault is in our society and even 
        on our campus today. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe Space supports survivors of all types of sexual 
        violence, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, incest, child sexual 
        abuse, and rape. </p>
