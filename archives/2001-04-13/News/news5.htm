      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;April is a busy time for Bowdoin student government 
        as officers begin to finalize plans for the next academic year and make 
        transitions in membership. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday marked the launch of elections for next year's 
        Student Executive Board, SAFC Chair, and Student Congress Chair, as well 
        as a vote on a Constitutional referendum. Elections will be held online 
        until 6:00 p.m. Sunday, April 15; the web site is <a href="www.bowdoin.edu/vote">www.bowdoin.edu/vote</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following thirteen students are running for next 
        year's Student Executive Board: Tejus Ajmera '04; Dominique Alepin '03; 
        Cesar Aviles '04; Ned Bair '03; Lenz Balan '04; Shanique Brown '04; Jason 
        Hafler '04; Edward MacKenzie '03; Meghan MacNeil '03; Kara Oppenheim '04; 
        Jay Rawlins '03; Alicia Smith '04; and Michael Taylor '02. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of these candidates, Meghan MacNeil and Michael 
        Taylor, are current Board members. Students will have the ability to vote 
        for up to nine candidates for the Executive Board. The voting web site 
        includes each candidate's name, class year, and "Statement of Candidacy."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two students are running for the position of SAFC Chair: 
        Kate Donovan '02, current SAFC Chair, and David Sohn '04. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, for the first time, the student body is also 
        electing the Congress Chair, a position that was previously voted for 
        by the Congress. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Board member Eric Diamon, the reason this 
        change is being made is "to ensure that the Congress can establish itself 
        as a student government organization and not depend on the Student Executive 
        Board to dictate the Congress's agenda." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Megan Faughnan '02, current Congress Chair, is running 
        against Margo Woolverton '02 for the position.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional referendum under consideration is 
        the largest to occur in quite some time. It proposes changes to the chartering 
        and reviewing of organizations and clubs, as well as changes to the role 
        of each Student Government organization. These changes are intended to 
        make Student Government more convenient for students to use to their benefit. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If passed, the Referendum would make Student Congress 
        the sole legislative branch of Student Government. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Executive Board would do more administrative 
        activities, like overseeing elections and chartering and reviewing organizations.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the vote at Monday's faculty meeting to finalize 
        a long-desired extension to Thanksgiving Break, the Student Executive 
        Board seconded the measure. Beginning next semester, the Wednesday before 
        Thanksgiving will be a holiday for a two-year probationary period. The 
        Board appreciates and recognizes Dean Foster's role in supporting the 
        Thanksgiving proposal.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Board members have also announced that the new parking-towing 
        notification service is underway. Members will notify students by phone 
        when their cars are towed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Board also initiated discussion on the 
        possibility of a Bowdoin web site that would be geared specifically to 
        the members of the Bowdoin Community.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Government is planning another forum of discussion 
        before the close of the semester. It also plans to open future discussion 
        on the Health Center as well as on Off-Campus Study. </p>
