      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" --> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sit at my iBook, trying to ponder the subjects of my 
        last few columns, I am reminded of the old adage that is often applied 
        to the business world: "It's not what you know, but who you know." While 
        I have always assumed this concise little saying to be true for investment 
        bankers and politicians, I have recently been finding it to be true in 
        relation to my own experience here at Bowdoin. It's not what I know, but 
        who I know. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I find it slightly ironic that, after shelling out $120,000 
        to attend this elite liberal arts institution, the most important thing 
        that I have gained from Bowdoin is not my education but my friends. Now 
        don't get me wrong: the education I have received at Bowdoin has been 
        top-notch. I have learned things about the world around me that have forever 
        changed the way I look at it, often in ways that I cannot express. However, 
        I will not remember my most important relationships at Bowdoin as being 
        with my textbooks, but as being with those around me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reminded of the importance of these relationships 
        lately through the work I have been doing as a student teacher. In the 
        past fourteen weeks, I have made many, many friends at the Richmond Middle 
        School. Faculty, staff, and students have all had a profound effect on 
        my life and on my perception myself and those around me. For me, this 
        real-world experience has been my most important "classroom time" at Bowdoin, 
        even though I have spent none of it in an actual Bowdoin classroom. The 
        reason that I will be sad to leave Richmond in two weeks, however, is 
        not because I miss the grading, the tests, or the preparation. Rather, 
        I will miss the people I met there, and the people who I am certain will 
        remain friends for many years to come. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The same is true with many of the friendships I have made 
        at Bowdoin. Whether these friends be fellow students, staff members, or 
        professors, I have formed bonds that I imagine will last a long time. 
        I have gotten to know the families of many of my professors, a very positive 
        and enriching experience for me. I have gotten to know professors both 
        inside of class and during office hours, at the Café, or just in my wanderings 
        around campus. I have gotten to know fellow seniors, juniors, sophomores, 
        and firstyears in dorms, classrooms, activities, and clubs. It is my firm 
        belief that the more people I meet, the better. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is not to say that I value all of my friendships the 
        same, nor is it to say that I consider one friendship to be "better" than 
        another simply because I feel closer to one person than I do to another. 
        No, the friends that I have made during my time at Bowdoin will always 
        be important to me because they offered their support, told a joke, lent 
        an ear, or helped me out in a tough situation. Every friend that I have 
        made here has added something important to my life and I am a better person 
        for it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So, members of the senior class: as we wind down this semester 
        and prepare to head out into the world, let's try to remember our friendships 
        and how important they are to so many of us. It's time, as Robert Frost 
        would say, to mend walls; to tell those around you (as Oprah-ish as this 
        might sound) that you care about them. Perhaps it was 80s mopester Morrissey 
        who put it best, and so Simply: "Hold onto you friends." </p>
