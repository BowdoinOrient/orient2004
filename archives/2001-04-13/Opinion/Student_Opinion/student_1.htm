      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here I am. Waiting for divine inspiration to strike. 
        I've been waiting for a while now, and well, I am yet to be struck. I'm 
        not sure if my hair is supposed to streak white as it does when lightning 
        strikes, but whatever the consequence, I know that I'm just not writing. 
        Usually my muse hides in waiting 'til deadlines loom, and then she reveals 
        herself. But this week, well, I think she's on vacation, and who wouldn't 
        want to be? So, yeah, this muse thing really isn't, well, amusing. Patience 
        only lasts so long when impending due dates are in just a few hours. Maybe 
        she just doesn't know where to look for me. I've been hiding in the library 
        all week; it's conceivable she thought I fell into a black hole, a vortex 
        of time and space that is essentially the definition of a library. In 
        fact, I'm here right now, in the basement of Hawthorne and Longfellow. 
        What an interesting place this little computer room is. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The guy next to me is making faces at his computer screen-I 
        wonder if he can see his reflection or the paper that he is writing demands 
        that he make faces. Making Faces 101, now there's a course I should try. 
        How does one begin a paper for that class? "If one must make a face, it 
        is better to do so in the privacy of one's home, but if the aforementioned 
        is not at your disposal, make sure that the muscles of your face contract 
        in an upward fashion into what has been coined a 'smile.'" Maybe I should 
        ask him. The girl on my right has checked her email five times in the 
        past two minutes-talk about obsession. I secretly mutter "Girl, if he 
        was gonna email you, he would have done it already. Saturday night was 
        like four days ago, get over him. And no, you are not getting that fancy 
        tube top back." followed, of course, with a few finger snaps on a zig-zagging 
        hand. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, this is pretty fun. Here I am. No one knows what 
        I am doing-which is, of course, watching and writing about the people 
        around me. Little do they know the intention of this little observation 
        exercise. That is, of course, the beauty of it all. I just have to play 
        cool. Yup, typing away, I've got this Huge paper due tomorrow, yup, that's 
        right, for my sociology class. It's a doozy. In fact, I better keep typing. 
        The guy right across from me just sat down. An interesting fellow. I wonder 
        what he is working on. Looks like government class. Ahh, another aspiring 
        politician. I wonder what his take on the Jesse Jackson trip to China 
        is. He looks a bit stressed. The paper is probably due tomorrow morning, 
        and from the looks of it, well, he just hasn't started it. I could do 
        his internal monologue for you, but I'm afraid it would appear as a series 
        of asterisks and dollar signs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, directly behind me, (Yes, I turned around to 
        look) is Mr. Surf the Internet himself. Doesn't he have work to do? Or 
        does he have that much money invested in stocks that he has to check the 
        Dow every ten minutes. (Alright, maybe he's an econ major). But still, 
        who has time to surf the web? Next I think he'll be checking out I'msosmartidon'thavetodowork.com. 
        Yeah, it sucks just knowing everything. Maybe his computer will freeze 
        on him, mid-stock check. Heaven forbid he be forced to go outside and 
        enjoy the nice weather. Oh, and then there are, of course, the floaters 
        of the computer room. Bouncing in and out, here and there. What an energetic 
        bunch. But must they insist on making a grand, rambunctious entrance everytime 
        they walk in, as if a gale a force just blew them in. They know all of 
        us stuck behind a computer are going to look. Who wouldn't? I'm going 
        to lay down an extension cord right across the doorway, then let's see 
        how grand the entrances are. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; From the looks of it, I think I'm the only sane one here. 
        "Look" and "sane" being the two operative words in that sentence. My muse 
        is outside basking in the sun, that I am sure of, and laughing at me the 
        whole time she does. But in the meantime, I'm gonna breathe in some very 
        stuffy air, turn to the guy next to me and stick out my tongue, email 
        the girl on my right, steal the stressed-out gov major's coffee, ask the 
        guy directly behind me if he heard that the stock market crashed, and 
        tell all the floaters to stop distracting me. Can't they see that I'm 
        writing a paper? </p>
