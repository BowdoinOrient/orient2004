      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In bringing Dr. Gail Dines to campus this past week, Safe 
        Space performed a great service to the Bowdoin community. Most people 
        did not agree with everything Dines said, and some people agreed with 
        nothing she said. However, for the first time in a long time, there was 
        standing room only in Kresge Auditorium, and not for a concert or play, 
        but for a lecture addressing the issue of violence against women. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Although the general Bowdoin population is tolerant of groups 
        such as Safe Space, the Bowdoin Women's Association, and WARRIORS, it 
        is rare that students move beyond a general recognition of an issue to 
        question the origins of such problems. When a student publicly shares 
        his or her experience of surviving sexual assault or abuse, or some other 
        type of socially influenced trauma, a collective sympathy is usually expressed 
        by most of the student body. However, such sympathy is rarely translated 
        into self-reflection or an actual deconstruction of the issue. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In attending Dines's lecture, students were forced not only 
        to acknowledge that yes, violence against women is bad, but they were 
        challenged to think about why then, such a problem persists. Maybe Dines 
        doesn't have all of the answers, or at least the correct ones, but she 
        offered plenty of evidence which suggests there is an urgent need to begin 
        critically thinking about the way in which our individual actions reinforce 
        the culture at large, and thus, the persistence of sexual and physical 
        violence against both women and men. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; If the student body cannot, or will not, acknowledge and 
        work to eliminate sexual violence at Bowdoin, then there is nothing exceptional, 
        smart, or prestigious about this institution. If you degrade or threaten 
        women, treat them as sexual objects, or if you chastise or attack men 
        who challenge such behavior, you have no place at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Why are members of the student body so hesitant to make such 
        definitive statements? Perhaps out of fears-the fear of social alienation, 
        ruining one's reputation or romantic prospects or fears of being verbally 
        or physically attacked. After all, Bowdoin is a small place, and working 
        for change, especially radical change, can be a lonely endeavor if most 
        of the campus is unwilling to participate, regardless of their beliefs. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; However, just because people seem to accept or even thrive 
        on the dominant culture, does not mean this is the case. Too may students 
        wonder why, if they are adhering to the prescribed gender norms and sexual 
        conduct of the dominant Bowdoin culture, they feel so bad while everyone 
        else appears so content. But when the keg runs dry and students find themselves 
        in a state of sober solitude, the memory of last night's hook-up, sexual 
        or emotional mistreatment, or mere witness of degrading or violent behavior, 
        causes most students to feel anything but content. </p>
