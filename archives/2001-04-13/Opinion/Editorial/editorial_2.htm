      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After Dr. Gail Dines's lecture on the effect of pornography 
        in the media, a student asked the always anticipated question, "What can 
        we do?" But when given a specific answer, another student expressed doubt 
        in ever seeing such a solution come into being at Bowdoin. When Dr. Dines 
        addressed that question to the audience, the response from the audience 
        was that the proposed solution seemed "too big." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What has happened to us that everything seems "too big"? 
        At what point did we lose the capacity to dream big dreams and honestly 
        believe that anything is attainable? We are the young generation. The 
        world is ours to change for the better. It is the young who are purportedly 
        idealistic. If we are cynics, who is left to change the world? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This, of course, relates to the ever-present accusation that 
        Bowdoin students are apathetic, that they don't care about anything, including 
        bringing down the pornography industry. But that doesn't seem to be true. 
        People do seem to care. When the seats in Kresge filled up, Bowdoin students, 
        faculty, and staff sat in aisles or stood in doorways to hear the keynote 
        speaker for Sexual Assault Awareness Week. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously, something sparked their interest. And while some 
        people may have been drawn to the lecture by the horrifically explicit 
        posters displayed around campus, it is also likely that some of those 
        people who gathered in Kresge Auditorium were effected by what they heard 
        and had a desire to promote change. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Though the desire may be present to effect change, it is 
        understandable that the task of changing the society in which we live, 
        in this case battling a multi-billion dollar industry, may seem daunting. 
        But the only reason the solution seems an intimidating proposition is 
        because the problem itself is so big. And yet that should be all the more 
        reason to persevere rather than admit defeat. The alternative is to live 
        with whatever problems exist and stand idly by and watch more problems 
        arise. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Many Bowdoin students who attended Dr. Dines's lecture probably 
        wondered themselves, "what can we do?" Well, that depends. If you don't 
        try, you can do nothing. If you do try, the question changes from "what 
        can we do?" to "what can't we do?"</p>
