      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am saying is neither revolutionary nor obvious; I 
        am trying to voice an open secret. I tried <a href="../../../2001-04-06/Opinion/Letters/letters_6.htm">last 
        week</a> to explain the nagging bitterness that many of us, though we 
        sense it, are stubborn enough to ignore and leave unexplained. That was 
        the easy part, for you and for me. This week I'm trying to explain that 
        process of ignorance, the process by which we ignore all the shit that 
        goes on, and the process by which this very letter will be placed under 
        the heading "shit that goes on," and thereby ignored. I am trying to end 
        the blindness, but I think it can only be done through extreme cynicism. 
        I hope you keep reading; I promise it's not pretty.</p>
      <p align="center">Message to students</p>
      <p>&nbsp; We operate under the bubble protectorate, but it's not the bubble 
        that's dangerous. What's dangerous is the way in which we uphold that 
        bubble every day, even when we think we're breaking it down. What's dangerous 
        is the particularization of "college life," the way in which it is set 
        aside from the rest of life, like an idyll.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Joining community groups won't help. That's always playing 
        the same game. Just stop and think about it for a minute.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We treat "college" as if it were some isolated incident of 
        our lives, painful yet useful. We are consciously sacrificing a certain 
        portion of our lives towards future success; that much is clear. But what 
        I want to point out is that, alongside those conscious sacrifices (school-work, 
        volunteering, sports), we are, without even a thought, cutting off the 
        means we might still and already possess to achieve success, if that's 
        our goal. By participating in college we are trying to avoid a life of 
        mediocrity, and yet the way in which we participate in college does not 
        prepare us for anything else.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Example: I have a hunch that I could be a successful painter, 
        and I have the desire, but I can't major in art because I need a serious 
        major, and besides, I want to preserve my art in its natural state, something 
        beyond the confines of what I can learn at Bowdoin. I will major in Economics 
        and take up painting again when I'm forty-three. I'll probably have to 
        swallow my pride and take an art course at that point, down at the local 
        community college, but just to refresh my skills. Then I'll be painting.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The problem with this line of thinking is that it is blind. 
        It ignores the question that if we are giving up on our desires now, what 
        will we be doing when we don't have the bubble? What kind of a sacrifices 
        will we be making then? What does it mean to "get the most out of Bowdoin," 
        if what we are doing most of all is perfecting our powers of self-denial 
        and self-censorship?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin is an elite institution. It is a place that is supposed 
        to be set apart from the capitalistic machine, a place where we are supposed 
        to find ourselves and come into our own. But the way we try to accomplish 
        that is by waving goodbye to our folks and spending four years pretending 
        we don't have any origins. Look at the way we act at parties, and the 
        nonsense we say in classes-the folks back home wouldn't know whether to 
        laugh, cry, or turn away. And the worst part about it is not that we're 
        cutting ties with our parents-it's that we're acting exactly the same 
        way that they did in college. The worst part about it all is that in our 
        very attempts to find our 'true' selves, we only find ourselves looking 
        into a funhouse mirror that goes back and back into the generations of 
        narcissistic college-goers that preceded us.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; American college is not different from American society; 
        college, like America, is consumerist and petty and, at least once a week, 
        vomit-inducing. But I'm not out to overthrow culture. I'm out to get people 
        talking about this stuff, and I entertain only a remote fantasy of rebellion-one 
        directed towards Bowdoin College and its pompous bureaucracy. I would 
        love nothing more, on a personal level, than to see so many firstyears 
        and sophomores quit this school-for at least a year and whatever the price-that 
        the College can't even go on functioning. Hey-why not?</p>
      <p align="center">Message to professors</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The process by which we students all ignore everything I 
        just said runs parallel to the process by which teachers will ignore everything 
        I am about to say. Nonetheless it has to be said, because the two processes 
        are equally dangerous.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to draw a parallel between the student body's 
        particularization of "college life," vis-a-vis the rest of life, and the 
        faculty's particularization of "class life," vis-a-vis the rest of campus 
        life. I find it very interesting-and I think so will other students-to 
        observe that the specific way most teachers operate in classes has an 
        effect on the specific way most students operate in social settings, in 
        the rest of campus life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Heather Hughes, an independent legal scholar, has a few things 
        to say about education in America. Hughes notes that most discussion that 
        goes on in class is "an exchange of pre-fabricated ideologies," which 
        she likens to students beating on drums in a rather predictable and boring 
        rhythm. I'm sure this sounds familiar. Hughes goes on to say that students 
        are never pushed to explore new types of rhythms, nor do they ever explore 
        even the circumference of their own drums.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But what Hughes implies, and what I want to say here, is 
        that no matter how challenging the teacher, no matter how foreign the 
        course material, there is always a mountain of work left to be done in 
        educating students to think. Just as students scramble to break down the 
        bubble protectorate, but are always caught in a cycle of upholding it, 
        teachers scramble to make students think creatively and "outside of the 
        box," but are always caught in a cycle of upholding their own stake in 
        that box. The professor who simply runs students through the academic 
        paces, even if he or she does it in a "creative" way, is not doing his 
        or her job.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We all know it's a damn struggle, but you need to think hard, 
        and incessantly, about where your efforts are going. Most often, they 
        are going down the drain.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So with that in mind-what is the effect, alluded to above, 
        that class life has on campus life? The short answer is that the person 
        you see so diligently banging her drum in your class is the same person 
        so diligently poisoning herself on weekends and preparing herself for 
        nothing beyond her class schedule, her community involvements, and her 
        sports competitions-endeavors of "college life" that in the end are sometimes 
        helpful for the student but always helpful for Bowdoin's reputation and 
        hence, your job. Yet your job is to provide us with an education, a way 
        to relate to the world as people. You can't separate the student and the 
        person, and you can't dismiss the fact that you are our providers in the 
        market. Many of us want more for our money than a few notes about your 
        personal academic fancy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Simply put, we're graduating unfulfilled, we don't feel more 
        skilled than when we came in, and if anyone wants to say otherwise just 
        look at the behavior of recent Bowdoin graduates. They know nothing better 
        than their relationship to the bubble, and to someone else's work (yours). 
        They seek some kind of replacement now that it's gone. Don't flatter yourself 
        in thinking that all those people going to grad school are impassioned 
        about law or medicine or history; many of them are simply lost.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Teach speaking. Teach writing. You haven't done it yet.</p>
      <p align="center">Message to all</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are paying a ton of money and four years of time 
        to come here. Do not ignore this fact, because it is supposed to be an 
        exchange, and there are too many of us who leave here without ever getting 
        what we paid for. We don't get an education-we graduate without much desire 
        to think and even less desire to express our thought in voice or in letter.</p>
