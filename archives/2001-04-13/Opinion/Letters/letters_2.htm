      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will make my voice heard! How about you?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As one who loves to talk, listen, read, and write, I strongly 
        believe that written and verbal communication are keys to self-expression. 
        I think that this type of communication is lacking at Bowdoin. So, with 
        this in mind, here's my story and my idea (if you want the longer version, 
        email me or call me, I'd be happy to share).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I was the interviewer for the Senior Profiles on the Bowdoin 
        website until last week, when I resigned from my position. The reason 
        is simple. I was told by the Director of Communications, Scott Hood, that 
        the Bowdoin website (www.bowdoin.edu) and the Senior Profiles section 
        are not places for "internal communication," and are not targeted at the 
        Bowdoin community. Rather, he said that the website is a location for 
        Admissions and serves to communicate with those "external" to Bowdoin. 
        Basically, in my opinion, this means it serves two purposes: (1) as an 
        Admissions' tool, and (2) as a fundraiser.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I had not realized before that "external" communication was 
        the sole intent of the Bowdoin site. Having had the idealized vision that 
        this website was supposed to offer students, staff, and faculty a chance 
        to communicate with each other on campus and inform the community of events 
        and information, I was surprised to find out that I had been totally wrong. 
        And after several problems with moderate to excessive editing that has 
        occurred this year to the students' profiles, I decided that I did not 
        want to be a part of the project anymore and chose to seek another direction 
        in trying to help facilitate communication at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In talking with Scott Hood about the situation, he said that 
        there was a miscommunication between his office, Admissions, and myself. 
        And because of this miscommunication and his advice, I write to you today. 
        First, a warning to those students asked to be profiled in the future, 
        please take notice that this project is intended to show only the positive 
        aspects of Bowdoin and not the real aspects, which may be all positive 
        for some, all negative, or a combination of the two. So, if you say something 
        that does not present Bowdoin in a positive light, chances are that it 
        will be edited.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A short aside. I don't want to portray Scott or the Office 
        of Communications as bad or unjust people, because they're not. They do 
        their job and they do it well, but their job is not to facilitate communication 
        on campus; it is to portray Bowdoin in a positive light to the public. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; OK, now to my idea.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; How about a Bowdoin College website for the Bowdoin community? 
        A student-run project with the purpose of facilitating communication on 
        campus. My vision is that it would supply information about events, but 
        also much more, such as ride-share information and a community forum and 
        chat section. And maybe even a section for Student Profiles. What else? 
        Well, I have ideas, but I have a feeling that others out there have even 
        more ideas, so contact me and let's get this thing moving. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, and Scott Hood has promised that this site will be directly 
        linked to the Bowdoin website, allowing for easy access across campus 
        and the world. Obviously the site "will not represent the views of Bowdoin 
        College," but it will be visible and readily accessible.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This project is not an easy one to undertake, not at all, 
        and the project has been tried before and has failed, but I really believe 
        that this project is needed. I have talked with CIS some and have important 
        contact information. And what I am asking from you, the Student Body, 
        is for students interested in helping me take on this project. I will 
        be studying abroad next year, but if we start soon, we can set the needed 
        foundation before the summer break begins. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't matter what your opinions or beliefs are, just 
        as long as you want to help facilitate communication on campus. </p>
