      <p>To the Bowdoin Community: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a good thing I'm writing this, instead of talking, 
        because you might be distracted by the robotic click that emits from the 
        cephalic end of my body every five seconds. That's the sound of my programmed 
        grey matter that some would call a brain. Lots of people around here have 
        one. Apparently, I fit into that category with about 99% of the student 
        body. If you could be so kind, readers, as to wait one second while I 
        find my head, the following response may be of some interest to you. I 
        wouldn't have read <a href="../../../2001-04-06/Opinion/Letters/letters_6.htm">last 
        week's Letter to the Community</a> if my roommate hadn't pointed it out 
        to me. Thankfully, I did. As my eyes moved closer to the bottom of the 
        page, I found myself growing increasingly angrier. Like giant, pulsing 
        forehead- vein-angry. One of the first things the author, Dan Farnbach, 
        mentions, is that for every "pissed-off" student like himself, who "actually 
        bothers to articulate his or her thoughts," there are probably fifty or 
        even 500 more who do not. Well, I'm pissed off.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Here's your articulation, in ten delicate points.</p>
      <p>1: Compliments to the Instigator<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I recently caught myself mentioning to a friend that I am 
        tired of reading stuff that is meant to appeal to generally everyone; 
        works that are chock full o' qualifications and disclaimers. It is much 
        more intriguing and thought-provoking, in my mind, to read something that 
        either catapults me into the realm of eureka or pisses me off to the point 
        where I'm a walking nuclear warhead. Dan Farnbach writes beautifully, 
        and clearly articulates his point, which makes it difficult for the reader 
        to argue with him. His argument is strong because it invokes a powerful 
        emotional response. But it's time for my cent-and-a-half.</p>
      <p> 2: Conspiracy Theory <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The fundamental flaw in Farnbach's argument is his description 
        of the fundamental flaw of this school. Mr. Farnbach has not succeeded 
        in convincing me that Bowdoin is simply a conspiratory institution founded 
        upon bogus notions of societal normatives. I cannot buy into the argument 
        that we, as Bowdoin students, are tacitly consenting to corruption by 
        such an institution; that we are conformist flocks of sheep, bleating 
        our way to the butcher to be shorn, flayed, and served on the dinner table 
        of "real life." I will not accept the vision that 99% of Bowdoin students 
        walk around with their craniums stuck in an extremely uncomfortable place, 
        and, by that, I don't mean the back of a Volkswagen. Perhaps I am defeating 
        my own purpose in writing this; my criticism of Mr. Farnbach's letter 
        may be as close-minded as his statements. Or maybe my head is just stuck 
        up my ass. </p>
      <p> 3: Cynicism vs. Romanticism<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dan is correct in his statement that he is not the only frustrated 
        student at this school. As long as we're into generalizing, I believe 
        we can categorize the majority of students here (probably everywhere) 
        within two schools of thought. These can be used to describe those who 
        find themselves in a perpetual state of frustration with their surroundings: 
        cynicism and romanticism. Forget Republicans and Democrats. The cynics 
        feel an impending sense of doom with most things in life, and therefore 
        choose to make fun of anything, expressing their discontent. Romantics 
        simply try to imagine everything idealistically. Both are equally not 
        happy with their present situation. And then there are those of us (I 
        am a prototypical example) who are 50% cynical and 50% romantic. But the 
        point here is to realize that being frustrated with one's surroundings 
        I think stems more from how one naturally approaches or views life, not 
        from the surroundings themselves. </p>
      <p>4: The Liberal Arts Rap <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mockery of the idea of the liberal arts institution is hinted 
        at in the "Letter to the Community", however, no more a liberal solution 
        is offered. If we are to think liberal, then we must still respect and 
        accept the possibilities of everything, not simply our personal idea of 
        how things should be done. We are not forced into anything we don't want 
        to do. No one holds a weapon to our head (or other valuable parts of our 
        bodies) and tells us we have to go to college, and that once we're there, 
        we have to live our lives as robots, droning from one academic building 
        to the next, and then droning back home. There are those who put their 
        work before friends and other social activities, and those who put social 
        lives before work. Those who find themselves jaded by the so-called "flood 
        of useless work" perhaps are more vulnerable to the possibility of being 
        affected by such compulsory requirements and inadvertently bring such 
        a condition upon themselves. What does this all lead to? We are old enough 
        to make our own choices. This isn't "The Faculty." </p>
      <p>5: Ripping It Apart<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Farnbach is presuming his expertise on the workings of 
        society and abstract schools of thought that institutionalize human actions. 
        I accuse him of a grave faux pas of contemporary opinion writing-something 
        we all do-making a big, fat, hairy generalization. Such as the criticism 
        of those who wish to be on time: "...the rapidity with which students 
        leave class for sports practices and athletic activities." Although I 
        suffer from the affliction of perpetual tardiness, I cannot look down 
        upon those whose lives revolve around schedules set up for organizational 
        purposes. Most normal people have to do that. Or...is that the problem? 
        Is normal a bad thing? Perhaps Dan will feel I am missing his point...that, 
        if I understood it correctly, people are more concerned with the next 
        "waste of time" on their schedule than caring enough about the class they 
        just left to stay and ask questions. Or maybe it's the alleged anorexia 
        epidemic that drives us to the exercise room. Forget the energizing, healthy 
        feeling one gets from a good workout. That's all a lie, too. THEY'RE ALL 
        GONNA LAUGH AT YOU!!!! Lest I forget to mention insensitivity to eating 
        disorders may fall under the category of having one's head stuck up one's 
        ass. </p>
      <p>6: A Few Questions of My Own <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Farnbach premeditated a response from "athletes and do-gooders" 
        in defense of the athletics programs and clubs which the school offers. 
        I'm not even going to begin what could turn into a lengthy discourse on 
        why these things aren't "a waste of time". What I can provide is a question: 
        who are we to say that what someone else likes to do is a waste of time? 
        Why do we care, if it makes them happy? Seems a simple enough question 
        to me. </p>
      <p>7: Defending the System <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What really cracked me up were the comments about what "happens 
        to a student" once he or she matriculates at Bowdoin. For reference: "...the 
        school begins to wear you down. They have you sign up, almost randomly 
        at first, for four classes a semester...between [all the work], students 
        are spread so thin...that the main thing we are learning is how to juggle 
        responsibilities and appear prepared". Sounds like a typical matriculation 
        week to me. Maybe we should restructure firstyear orientation into a sort 
        of hallucinogen-influenced-naked-on-the-quad-student-faculty-affair, during 
        which everyone shares their higher state of existence. Actually, now that 
        I said it, it doesn't sound like a bad idea to me. But seriously (that 
        was a joke, by the way), this is a destruction of the very ideals of why 
        higher academic institutions exist in the first place. By attending Bowdoin 
        and participating in traditional administrative procedures, am I conforming 
        to a terrible conspiracy by accepting such notions? I'd like to hope not, 
        but is it really that horrible if I am? </p>
      <p>8: Something my mom would say<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So, work conflicts with a "rounded social existence"? I'll 
        buy that, to some degree. But I'll also bring up the idea that one determines 
        the amount of work one does by choice of major, by choice of course, and 
        by choice of whether on not to spend time on work or hang out with people. 
        If you're pre-med, you go into it knowing that you're going to have to 
        take orgo, and you make that choice to commit to it. Of course, there 
        is always the unfortunate exception of those who are strongly encouraged 
        by outside influences to follow certain tracks of study, and to those, 
        I apologize for my statements. But for everything else, I see very clearly 
        the amount of power we have in making that choice. There's no conspiracy 
        involved. Being unsure of what you're doing is no reason to not sign up 
        for another semester and buy into Bowdoin's "mythological greatness." 
        Being unsure of what you're doing leaves open the possibility for change, 
        and Heaven forbid we are open-minded. That might screw up the 99% statistic. 
      </p>
      <p>9: Something to Think About <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently we are also "procrastinating the living of our 
        lives." I see pretty much no evidence for this. I can only come to the 
        conclusion that we cannot possibly begin to know the depths of one's thoughts, 
        other than our own, and even then we have a hard time figuring ourselves 
        out, so how, then, could we ever criticize someone for the way they choose 
        to live their life? In short, it is impossible to ever really know what 
        someone's deal is. If it doesn't directly affect us, why must we concern 
        ourselves with whether or not someone is wasting his or her time with 
        "bunk" extracurricular activities and too much school work? Or other stuff? 
        To me, spending time figuring out how much everyone else sucks instead 
        of figuring yourself out seems an ass-ostrich move, no? </p>
      <p>10: My Conclusion<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I guess that's the end of my food for thought. I went into 
        this response with the intention of paying full respect to Mr. Farnbach's 
        letter, while at the same time stating clearly the problems I saw in it. 
        I realize that I may have misinterpreted a few points in his letter, depending 
        on his original intent for the reader. So be it. However, in responding 
        to the letter, I agree with Farnbach on one aspect: I'm pissed off, and 
        I'm articulating my thoughts. I also realize that there's no way everyone 
        will agree with everything I have to say. I'm not trying to appeal to 
        everyone. I just wanted to take this opportunity to speak in opposition 
        to the criticism of the student body. I can only speak from personal experience 
        here because I cannot begin to know everyone on this campus, and I cannot 
        even come up with a generalization that applies to the entire student 
        body. But from what I've observed, everyone I've met here has something 
        to offer. Everyone I've met is passionate about something, and that something 
        is manifested in an infinite number of ways. Whether we realize our passion 
        yet or not is the main question, and perhaps that's what we're ultimately 
        here to find out. Who knows. We all do our own thing, and we all continue 
        to throw frisbees on the quad. No one's walking around with spirals in 
        their eyes.<br>
