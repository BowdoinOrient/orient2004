      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dear Dr Jeff: What exactly are canker sores? Where 
        do they come from? Can they be avoided? Can you get rid of them? What 
        can be done to soothe them when they pop up? B.L.</b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear B.L.: Canker sores are benign, open sores that 
        appear on the inner mucous membranes of the mouth. They may occur at any 
        age but usually begin in adolescence. They apparently occur more often 
        in women than in men. Although their cause is unknown, many researchers 
        have attempted to identify an infectious agent, and some suspect an as 
        yet unidentified member of the Herpesvirus family. They seem to be triggered 
        by other illnesses, stress, dietary deficiencies (especially iron, folic 
        acid or vitamin B12), food allergies, and hormonal changes (especially 
        menstrual).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canker sores usually begin with a tingling or burning 
        sensation, followed by painful, red spots or bumps which ulcerate, forming 
        open sores, often in clusters. Their centers appear white or yellow, and 
        they are often surrounded by raised, reddened edges. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 4 to 7 days or so, they become covered with gray-colored 
        membranes, and are less painful. Complete healing may take an additional 
        1 to 2 weeks. Recurrence is frequent and almost universal.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncommonly, canker sores are accompanied by more generalized 
        systemic symptoms as fever, malaise, fatigue and swollen lymph nodes. 
        In this setting, canker sores are clinically indistinguishable from the 
        lesions of Herpetic stomatitis, an illness of infants and young children 
        clearly caused by Herpes Simplex Virus. Unlike Herpes, however, canker 
        sores do not seem to respond to antiviral medications and they do not 
        seem to be contagious. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolonged or severe mouth ulcers may be a sign of other 
        problems as well, such as allergic drug reactions and dermatologic diseases 
        like pemphigoid, lichen planus and rarely squamous cell carcinoma. Mouth 
        ulcers can be very extensive and slow-healing in people who are receiving 
        chemotherapy or immunosuppression or who have AIDS. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, however, the vast majority of canker sores 
        are pretty clearly garden-variety canker sores and require no special 
        evaluation or treatment. People have tried a variety of home remedies 
        with some success in reducing symptom severity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variety of mouth washes seem to help. Try warm salt 
        water, 3 or 4 baby aspirin dissolved in warm water, or my favorite, liquid 
        Benadryl mixed with an equal amount of Mylanta. Rarely, and really only 
        for very extensive and slow healing sores, oral tetracycline or dexamethasone 
        washes can be prescribed. The herbal remedy Goldenseal has also proved 
        helpful, used in suspension as a wash or as an applied paste.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No proven preventive measures for canker sores have 
        been found. Good oral hygiene and overall good health and nutrition no 
        doubt help. Fortunately, canker sores are relatively short-lived and almost 
        always resolve spontaneously. </p>
