      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an English major, I was taking advanced courses, 
        including one in literary criticism taught by Professor Larry Hall. Due 
        to the relatively small number of students, all of them seniors, who were 
        enrolled in this course, it was conducted like a seminar at Larry Hall's 
        home on Orr's Island. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the half dozen or so students participating in 
        it was Ed Podvoll, who shared the top floor at Union Street with me and 
        Zal Colodny. Ed occupied the large room in front, and now that Bob Morrison, 
        who graduated in June '56, was no longer around for long chats in his 
        room at the fraternity house, I struck up a similar friendship with Ed. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though both Jewish, Ed and Zal couldn't have been more 
        different either in appearance or character. Short and stocky, Ed, with 
        curly reddish hair and an extremely pale complexion, wasn't "exactly pretty," 
        to use his own words. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zal, on the other hand, was tall and slim--a darkish 
        type with smooth skin and manner, who clearly considered himself a bit 
        of a ladies' man. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still a bit jealous, I think, that I had beaten him 
        to the job of chauffeuring Nellie, he used to pull my leg about "making 
        love to old ladies." With his dark good looks, Zal strongly reminded me 
        of my Philadelphia friend Simon, by now in the Navy and stationed, lucky 
        devil, with the Seventh Fleet in the Mediterranean, with his home base 
        at Villefranche not far from Nice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectually, however, I felt more drawn to Ed. A 
        doctor's son and soon to become an MD himself-though at present in a Buddhist 
        retreat near Paris, Bob Morrison tells me-Ed's main interests at college 
        seemed to be religion, philosophy, and literature. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent hours in Ed's room, with him telling me about 
        the writings of Karl Barth, Heidegger, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Martin Buber-little 
        more than names to me. I also listened to him reading or reciting favorite 
        bits of poetry by T.S. Eliot, and, as with Bob, we also listened to favorite 
        pieces of music. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, Ed was one of the stars in the small 
        group that once or twice a week made their way out to Orr's Island for 
        Larry Hall's course on Literary Criticism. Usually, we went in "Jancy," 
        with me at the wheel of the large and rather top-heavy Wilys jeep that 
        was lent to me by Bill, a philosophy major who ended up teaching at the 
        University of Vermont. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larry Hall was the least professorial-looking of teachers 
        imaginable. Small and wiry, and as a rule casually dressed in blue jeans 
        and a lumberjack shirt when teaching us at his home, he might have been 
        anything but a college professor. In fact, he looked more like the hobby 
        boat builder that he actually was in his spare time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A veteran of World War II, Larry had published short 
        stories in the manner of Stephen Crane's <i>Red Badge of Courage</i>--only 
        brought up to date. In both manner and appearance, he was the complete 
        opposite of Professor Louis Coxe, who was the latest addition to the English 
        department and the author of a dramatization of Billy Budd, which was 
        produced on Broadway, as well as a poet with a somewhat effete manner. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two, I by far preferred Hall, with a reputation 
        as a battle-scarred ladies' man in the mould of Ernest Hemingway. Larry, 
        it was said, had swapped wives with his neighbor on Orr's Island, each 
        divorcing his own and then marrying the other. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging by his new wife's looks and personality, he'd 
        come out the winner in this unconventional deal. Rather blunt in manner 
        and on occasion sharp-tongued, Larry took each and every one of us to 
        task without unduly sparing our feelings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having to compete with some of the brightest boys in 
        the department, I was no longer the "teacher's pet" as I had been two 
        years earlier in Herbie Brown's course on American literature. Nor was 
        Larry above correcting my English. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, while reading a paper out loud and pronouncing 
        the word "interdict" as written, he promptly, though with a good-natured 
        grin on his weather-beaten face, corrected me, saying it was pronounced 
        "interdite." I was so taken aback and embarrassed that I handed him my 
        paper to read it out loud for me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that I haven't forgotten this little incident 
        shows how deeply it must have affected me. However, looking the word up 
        in Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary just now, I find that the phonetic 
        spelling given corresponds to the way I pronounced it all those years 
        ago after all. Maybe American usage differs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite such little upsets, I enormously enjoyed Larry 
        Hall's seminar-far better than one I was to take part in at Columbia a 
        year later under Charles van Doren, the whiz kid of NBC's "21" quiz show, 
        famously rigged, though not yet found out and disgraced. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teaching was a great life, the quiz show star used to 
        tell us, laughing all the way to the bank. Larry Hall, on the other hand, 
        was a far more convincing teacher and a loveable character in his own 
        right, just like Herbie Brown. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked and shared Larry's irreverent approach to life 
        and literature. Neither of us, for example, cared much for Dickens, as 
        we one day laughingly confessed to one another, apart from <i>Tale of 
        Two Cities</i>, his least typical novel. I am sorry old Larry isn't around 
        anymore to have a good chuckle over what I've written about him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time on the way back from Orr's Island, with four 
        or five of us in the car, and me at the wheel trying to take evasive action 
        to avoid smashing into the car in front, having suddenly stopped to turn 
        off to the left, top-heavy "Jancy" went wildly careening on two wheels 
        for a few frightening moments, before just in time righting herself again. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone except me laughed, trying to make light of 
        the danger we'd been in. But looking back, one can imagine the headlines 
        in local papers: Five Students Killed As Jeep Turns Over. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The near-accident happened on the road between Bath 
        and Brunswick, close to a drive-in where I'd seen <i>East of Eden</i> 
        with a brilliant young actor called James Dean, little knowing this bright 
        new star in the Hollywood firmament was destined to be killed in a road 
        accident at the height of his youthful fame. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those whom the gods love die young, they say. Happily, 
        they don't seem to have loved me or my friends in the car coming back 
        from Orr's Island that day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that much anyway. </p>
