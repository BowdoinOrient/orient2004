      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Clint Huston '02 organized a trip to the CBS studios 
        for the Bowdoin track team to witness a taping of <i>The Price Is Right</i>, 
        many knew that it would be an exciting and memorable experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two groups of track athletes ventured to Los Angeles 
        from San Diego for two days during the team's spring training trip, and 
        on both days, Bowdoin was well represented on <i>The Price Is Right</i>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin's own Gregory Bangser '04 and Tony Small '02 
        encountered amazing success on the show: not only were they each among 
        the first four to be called up to contestant's row at the start of their 
        tapings, but both Greg and Tony made it on stage and proceeded to win 
        the prize offered from their pricing game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin fans in the audience screamed advice from the 
        crowd, helping Greg to bid on and rake in two foldable bikes, a riding 
        lawn mower, a grandfather clock, a bar set (that he plans on displaying 
        in his room in Boody next year), and also a $1,000 cash bonus from his 
        $1.00 spin on the big wheel. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony's gain was even larger: he walked away with a dinette 
        set (now donated to his parents), a gift certificate to Jennifer Convertible's 
        furniture store, and a "fabulous, new" Saturn SC-1 sports car. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a common theme this year for groups from colleges 
        around the country to venture to Bob Barker's 29 year-and-running game 
        show for that chance to "come on down." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among an audience of 300-plus contestants, it was thrilling 
        to see Bowdoin representatives be called down on both shows. Both Greg 
        and Tony admit that they lost all sense of reality when they were on camera 
        and asked to bid; whether it was distraction from the hype in the crowd, 
        the revolving lights around the stage, or the preoccupation with the Barker 
        Beauties who were displaying bid items only inches from their faces, our 
        boys failed miserably in their first attempts while on contestant row. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the confusion was no victor, for both contestants 
        won their pricing games with a little help from their friends. Greg credits 
        Jamie Salsich '03 for towering above the rest of the crowd and bellowing 
        out "LAWN MOWER!" to help aid in his decision of which item was priced 
        wrong. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the hype on stage, Tony still felt as though 
        he were in a dream world; he said, "I really didn't realize what had happened 
        until I was taken offstage by one of the producers and told to sign all 
        sorts of papers."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as future plans with their recent big wins, both 
        Tony and Greg intend on keeping the furniture that they won and selling 
        the rest of the goods. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tony plans on using the cash to invest in IRA and mutual 
        funds, whereas Greg would like to sell his prizes so he can "buy a car 
        and be as cool as Tony." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are interested in viewing the debut of Bowdoin's 
        successes on The Price Is Right, then tune in on April 25 for Greg's premier, 
        and on April 26 for Tony's big win. Both shows will be run on channel 
        13 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. </p>
