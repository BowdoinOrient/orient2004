      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of the table sat Joseph, one of the leaders 
        of the Nez Perce Indians of Eastern Washington State (then Washington 
        Territory), and on the other side sat Oliver O. Howard, Bowdoin graduate, 
        Civil War veteran, peace negotiator, and commander of the Department of 
        Columbia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sides had been brought to the table in the common 
        goal of avoiding bloodshed, for both sides now stood on the verge of war. 
        Joseph and the other chiefs at the meeting demanded that they be allowed 
        to remain where they were, for these were their ancestral lands. Howard 
        and his officers demanded the opposite. The Federal government, Howard 
        declared, had ordered all Nez Perce to move to the Lapwai reservation. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indian Joseph and his malcontents denied the jurisdiction 
        of the United States over them. They were offered everything they wanted, 
        if they would simply submit to the authority and government of the United 
        States agents," Howard wrote, apparently not realizing the great irony 
        that fifteen years earlier he had fought in a war that became a crusade 
        to set other people free and now he was advocating that these Nez Perce 
        surrender their freedom and submit to the authority of the "government."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day of the Lapwai peace conference, May 
        7, 1877, a Nez Perce named Too-hul-hul-sote stood his ground and demanded 
        that his people be allowed to stay where they were. It was not for the 
        government in Washington to tell them where they were to live, the old 
        man said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard reported that the old man's statements were causing 
        tensions to rise, and so he had the old man arrested. The others, Howard 
        reported, soon became calm and agreed to the terms of the treaty.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble, however, was in the air. In early June, 1877, 
        as the Nez Perce were moving toward their new home on the Lapwai reservation, 
        a small band of warriors, perhaps drunk, left the village and went on 
        a killing spree, resulting in the death of a number of settlers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As word of the actions reached the camp, many of the 
        Nez Perce seemed to be suddenly caught up in the heat of the moment and 
        vowed to join the warriors. There would be a fight after all. If Howard 
        or anyone else wanted to throw them off of their land, let them come and 
        try. The Nez Perce formed a defensive position at White Bird Canyon.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard had every intention of throwing them off their 
        land. The commander of the department immediately sent two companies of 
        cavalry under Captain David Perry to force the surrender of the Nez Perce. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cavalry units found the Nez Perce on June 17, 1877, 
        at White Bird Canyon where a firefight broke out. Perry's men were routed, 
        having found out the hard way that the Nez Perce were excellent shots. 
        Thirty-four Union soldiers had been killed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nez Perce never scalped or mutilated any bodies, 
        and there was no exception throughout the campaign that was to follow.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen what the Nez Perce could do to an unprepared 
        opponent, Howard called in troops from his entire department and prepared 
        to take the field personally. On June 21, with five hundred troops, Howard 
        began his pursuit of the Nez Perce. He chased them all around the Salmon 
        River area but was unable to catch them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furious, Howard sent two companies of troops to detain 
        Chief Looking Glass, a Nez Perce leader of another band that had proclaimed 
        its neutrality. The soldiers began taking matters into their own hands. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shots were fired, and Looking Glass's village was burnt, 
        forcing him to join Joseph and his renegade Indians. Instead of preventing 
        Joseph from gaining reinforcements, Howard did the opposite, and now he 
        confronted his opponent at the Battle of the Clearwater. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Battle of Clearwater was a decisive victory for 
        Howard. After two days, his troops finally penetrated the Nez Perce lines, 
        but then all of a sudden, he stopped. Instead of following up his victory, 
        Howard let the Nez Perce escape him by slipping into the Lolo Trail, an 
        ancient hunter's trail leading into Montana. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This habit of giving the Indians a head start over him 
        throughout the entire campaign earned Howard the name "General Day-After-Tomorrow," 
        from the Nez Perce.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard did move, but he would not catch the Nez Perce 
        for a very long time. He marched with his men along ridges, mountains, 
        streams, forests, and fields. The beauty of the land should have made 
        Howard, or anyone else for that matter, understand what these natives 
        were fighting for. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many remounts and incredible marching skills, the 
        Nez Perce, men, women, and children, were able to keep ahead of Howard 
        and flank a small Federal column in the Bitterroot Valley.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they headed south through that Valley, toward the 
        home of the Crow, their assumed allies, they came into contact with a 
        Federal force under General John Gibbon. Gibbon, a hard fighter and a 
        tough veteran of the Civil War, attacked the Nez Perce camp on the Big 
        Hole River on August 8. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Killing many women and children, his soldiers were at 
        first successful, but a counterattack by the Nez Perce turned the tables, 
        and Gibbon was soon under siege and cut off from his supplies. The timely 
        arrival of Howard on the next day relieved Gibbon, but the Nez Perce were 
        already gone, moving toward Yellowstone National Park.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard continued to follow. On August 19, at Camas Meadows, 
        near Henry's Lake in Idaho, Howard's command was surprised, and most of 
        his horses were stampeded or captured by the Nez Perce. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard called a halt, and as he went to procure some 
        more mounts for his weary command, he began a series of communications 
        with his chief, General William T. Sherman. Howard reported that his command 
        was quite tired. To this, Sherman wired that maybe he should give command 
        of the force to some other officer and go back to his headquarters. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard immediately wrote back that, "Neither you nor 
        General McDowell can doubt my pluck and energy." He would, he said, do 
        as Sherman had previously ordered and (in Sherman's words) "pursue the 
        Nez Perce to the death." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman wired back that he was "glad to find you so 
        plucky," and wished him well. On the next day, however, Sherman had second 
        thoughts, and wrote an order relieving Howard of command. Fortunately 
        for Howard, the man Sherman gave the order to never reached Howard, and 
        thus the general was allowed to see the campaign to its close. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That close was not far off. Having failed to get the 
        Crow to support them, the Nez Perce headed northward toward Canada in 
        hopes that Chief Sitting Bull's Sioux warriors would help them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hope would be dashed. At the crossing of the Yellowstone 
        River, the Nez Perce fought off yet another Union command under General 
        Samuel Sturgis, who during the Civil War had the unlucky honor of coming 
        up against Nathan Bedford Forrest at the Battle of Brice's Crossroads. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sturgis' failure opened the way for yet another Union 
        command to cut off the Nez Perce before they reached the Canadian border. 
        General Nelson A. Miles, soon to become one of the greatest military heroes 
        of the century, and his troops found and attacked the Nez Perce at the 
        Battle of the Bear Paws from the 30th of September to the 5th of October. 
        Cut off from their horses and without proper supplies, the Nez Perce had 
        no choice but to surrender on the 5th of October. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having arrived the night before with only a handful 
        of cavalry escorts, Howard was there for this surrender. As Joseph came 
        forward, his rifle in hand to present it to Howard, the Maine general 
        waved it towards Miles. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uttering the famous words, "From where the sun now stands, 
        I will fight no more forever," Joseph ended the Nez Perce War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a running war that had taken his men from the 
        eastern boundary of present-day Washington State to Idaho, into Montana, 
        and almost to the Canadian border. It had been a journey of almost seventeen 
        hundred miles in which the Nez Perce had outfought almost everyone in 
        their path and had eluded Howard's traps for months. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They certainly deserve all the credit for their deeds. 
        They even earned Howard's commendation that there "are few Indians in 
        America superior to the Nez Perce."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nez Perce War over, Howard returned to his normal 
        routine of camp life, only to take the field again in 1878 when his former 
        allies, the Bannock's went on the warpath as well. This quick summer war 
        was swiftly crushed by Howard's planning and administrative abilities. 
        That war was to be the last war in which Howard was to lend a hand. In 
        1881, Oliver Howard came back east.<br>
