      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's election time again… <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Now, before you all let out a simultaneous, collective groan 
        and grumble, "Not again!" let me put your minds at ease: It's only in 
        a play. But for the gravity of emotion and thought-provoking issues it 
        raises, this weekend's production of "Law of Reflect" written and directed 
        by Tom Ferguson '01 might as well be the real thing. With a truly stellar 
        cast and a roller coaster of a storyline, "Law of Reflect" gives a powerful 
        and gripping look at the campaign of a man who would be president and 
        the lives he affects on his way to the top. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Governor Jim Norris (Travis Cummings '01) seems like the 
        perfect candidate for the American presidency: He's a popular Democrat 
        with a successful political history, has a beautiful wife (Sarah Hagedorn 
        '03) and three bright children, as well as a deeply devoted campaign manager. 
        Kevin Willis (Edward Barnes '99), Norris' right-hand man for twenty years 
        in public office, is a master at his job. His political connections extend 
        across the country, and he even has a close relationship with Norris' 
        family, taking care of them when the governor is otherwise occupied.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the tense days before the presidential election, Norris 
        is focused on his sole objective: To present the best image possible of 
        himself and his family so that he can win the approval of the American 
        people. His opponent, the able and experienced Republican Vice-president 
        Bell, is a master debater and already well established in the American 
        political arena. Norris must focus all of his energy on preparing for 
        his upcoming debate, but from the start it becomes clear that his life 
        is far too complicated for this to happen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We discover almost immediately that the circumstances surrounding 
        Norris and his family are not at all what they at first appear to be. 
        Norris' reputation as a family man begins to crack when we see his dalliances 
        with his campaign manager's wife (Jana Richardson '03), as well as the 
        unspoken longing between his own wife and Willis. But what really starts 
        to unravel the fabric of Norris' image is the unfortunate mistake of his 
        oldest daughter Ione (Sara McLaughlin '03), who discovers she is pregnant 
        just days before the election. The gaping rift between father and daughter 
        is exposed through this trauma, as the hurt and angry Ione refuses Norris' 
        demand to give up the baby.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Norris' other children have also been suffering 
        from his neglectful attitude towards his family. Larkin's sixteen-year-old 
        (Sarah Hoenig '02) life is solitary and uneventful, and she is he only 
        one who actually sees the lack of love between her mother and father. 
        She longs to meet boys and lead a normal teenage life, but her father's 
        position prevents all of this. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; She begins to find a way to express herself, however, with 
        the arrival of one of her father's young aides, Christine (Melissa Miness 
        '04), who helps her break out of the shell she's been put in by her position 
        as daughter of the governor. J.J. (Joseph Mayo '04), Norris's only son, 
        is largely unaware of the fragmented state of his family, and would rather 
        go to clubs than be forced to attend his father's functions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As the election nears, the pressure mounts in the Norris 
        campaign as well as the Norris family, while everyone suffers through 
        the tension that is suffocating them. The situation finally comes to a 
        head at the debate, after which things begin to fall apart-as well as 
        come together. The second half of the play is a wild ride of emotional 
        ups and downs that you'll have to witness for yourselves, with a shocking 
        ending that will leave audiences speechless.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Ferguson, who wrote and directed "Law of Reflect" as 
        an Honors Project for the Department of Theater and Dance, had only wonderful 
        things to say about the cast. "This has been the best cast to work with…they 
        are absolutely amazing; I just love every one of them." The production 
        was indeed cast flawlessly: Travis Cummings '01 is excellent as the ambitious 
        but loveless Governor Norris, and Edward Barnes '99 is simply stunning 
        as he transforms the character of Kevin Willis through the play. Sarah 
        Hagedorn '03 wonderfully portrays the left-behind wife of Norris, and 
        Sara McLaughlin '03 rages with elegance and poise. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah Hoenig '02 also does a great job of creating the teenager 
        by whom everyone loves to be annoyed. The supporting cast is also superb, 
        making the production a true wonder to behold. This play will definitely 
        be the talk of campus for weeks to come, so pick up your ticket for Friday 
        or Saturday at 7 p.m. as soon as possible. </p>
