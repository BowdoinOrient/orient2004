      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately for all of us, the latest Steve Guttenberg 
        racecar-driving opus, Overdrive, is no longer in stock at the local video 
        store. While Meatballs 4, starring Corey Feldman, did look rather tempting, 
        I was inexplicably drawn to Forgotten City, an archeological adventure 
        flick about a lost Mayan metropolis, and the bad actors who try to find 
        it. The video cassette itself was made out of a bright banana yellow plastic, 
        and proved to be the film's most redeemable feature. Everything that happened 
        after I pushed the video into my VCR was a big disappointment. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There weren't any previews! Since crappy movies you've never 
        heard of usually have previews for more crappy movies you've never heard 
        of, I tend to find these ads very useful and informative for my column. 
        Forgotten City stars Robert Patrick, the guy who played the amorphous 
        T-1000 android in Terminator 2. Once Patrick opens his mouth on screen, 
        it becomes painfully obvious why he had once been cast to play a robot. 
        Patrick plays Jim, a happy executive whose world is turned upside-down 
        when he receives a frantic phone call from his brother in Costa Rica. 
        He asks Jim to come to Costa Rica immediately and to bring the gold Mayan 
        tray that he had found years ago. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When Jim arrives in Costa Rica, he discovers that he was 
        too late, since his brother had been tortured to death. In search of answers, 
        Jim teams up with a sexy female archaeologist from Italy. They tear through 
        the Costa Rican streets on her dirt bike while bad guys chase them and 
        shoot at them with automatic weapons. The sexy archaeologist takes Jim 
        to her employer, a wealthy and eccentric adventure-seeker, played by Fred 
        Ward. You may remember Ward from the campy 80's horror flick Tremors. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, when Ward isn't sharing the screen with the 
        brilliant Kevin Bacon and a gaggle of giant man-eating snake monsters, 
        his acting performance becomes much more detached. I could sense that, 
        as he portrayed his character in Forgotten City, he was yearning for a 
        higher level of engagement with his work, as if he was thinking, "Without 
        giant man-eating snake monsters, I am nothing." Ward's performance truly 
        suffered due to this nostalgic bout of melancholia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we'll always have Tremors 2: Aftershocks. Getting back 
        to the film at hand, Jim hands over the gold Maya tray. The sexy archeologist 
        tries to decipher its meaning, and determines it is a map to the Forgotten 
        City. Jim interrupts her thoughts, "What does it say?" "It just talks 
        about, here, the old man in the mountain," she explains. A native guide 
        offers a thought, "There is a range on the Caribbean side, who's highest 
        peak is called by the locals 'the old man.' Could this be what you're 
        looking for?" "I don't know. It could be," the sexy archaeologist says 
        blankly with profound disinterest. And so our crew is off to a flying 
        start on their perilous and trying expedition... to the Forgotten City. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way, a bunch of militant natives shoot, stab, and 
        blow-up a number of people on Ward's research team, but through much adversity, 
        they eventually find the Forgotten City, which is buried below the ground. 
        Jim and the sexy archaeologist discover the entrance to a tomb, and when 
        they discover the gold inside, they take off each other's clothes and 
        make-out in slow motion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When they return to the rest of the group with the good news 
        about the gold, they find that their native guide has double-crossed them, 
        and the militant group that has been giving them so much trouble pops 
        out of the jungle and holds them at gunpoint. Their leader grabs a nameless 
        member of the expedition and holds a poisonous tree frog to his face, 
        explaining that as he rubs the frog into his eyes, he will die of a most 
        painful death. A lot of shooting and running around ensues, but in the 
        end Jim and the sexy archaeologist are the only ones who survive unscathed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; They escort a dying Fred Ward into the tomb. Upon seeing 
        the gold, Ward slumps over and says "I'll be damned, the old bastard wasn't 
        lying," and then keels over and dies. I have no idea who the "old bastard" 
        was that he was referring to. In the closing scene, Jim and the sexy archaeologist 
        are sitting beach side during a sunset, sipping on mango juice. They kiss. 
        "Mmm, you taste like mangoes," the sexy archaeologist says. "You too." 
        The End. Forgotten City was nothing more than a huge waste of time, and 
        would most likely make Meatballs 4, seem like a work of art. I would be 
        inclined to give this film an F, but since the video cassette was made 
        of that bright banana yellow plastic, it gets a D. Before I sign off, 
        I've been asked to plug a couple movies the Film Studies department is 
        showing early next week. Don't miss Glen or Glenda, the Ed Wood transvestitism 
        classic, and Marihuana, a mock documentary about the dangers of marijuana 
        in the spirit of Reefer Madness. Check out the calendar for more details. 
        See you there... </p>
