      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While many changes have been taking place within various 
        Asian student groups on the Bowdoin campus this year, their cumulative 
        effort will be manifested this coming week in the plethora of activities 
        planned in celebration of Asian Week. Bowdoin has ushered in a new generation 
        of Asian students with a fresh outlook on the role that Asian student 
        groups should have on campus. While Asian Week at Bowdoin has been successful 
        in the past, this year the focus has expanded to be more inclusive and 
        seeks to offer something exciting and new to all members of the Bowdoin 
        community.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the Asian Students Association (ASA), there 
        are other Asian student groups that have come together to form a committee 
        to organize this celebratory week, and in doing so, the ties between the 
        groups have become stronger. Both the Korean American Student Association 
        (KASA), which represents the largest minority group on campus, and ANOKHA, 
        the organization of south Asian students, have been successful in bringing 
        speakers to campus and increasing awareness of their perspective associations. 
        The International Club has a membership base of mostly foreign students, 
        and in its inaugural semester at Bowdoin, the Hawaiian Club has recently 
        been established. Along with the ASA, these four groups have joined as 
        a team in order to celebrate Asian cultures through a wide variety of 
        exciting activities planned for the coming week, including acupuncture, 
        a DJ contest, sushi, speakers, and many more.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The week starts off this Saturday the 14th at 8 p.m. with 
        a lecture by famous DJ Kuttin Kandy. As a member of the Fifth Platoon 
        Organization, Kuttin Kandy has appeared on MTV twice and has competed 
        in DJ competitions around the world. She is going to speak on what it 
        is like to be an Asian woman in the Hip Hop industry. Her lecture is going 
        to be followed by a DJ competition between Kuttin Kandy and DJ Roli Rho, 
        a two time DJ champion. This event is sponsored by the Freshman and Junior 
        classes. Zeke Yusah, the head of ASA commented that, "classes should support 
        minority groups. It is good for leaders to show concern. I also hope that 
        Kuttin Kandy will attract people because of her commentary on Hip Hop 
        culture. " After experiencing the mixes of world DJ competitors, Sunday's 
        activities offer more musical opportunities with an evening Coffee House 
        at 9pm at Howell House, featuring among other things, Indian desserts. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On Monday, acupuncturist Julie Meyers will be giving a unique 
        lecture about the art of acupuncture throughout China's history. This 
        event takes place at Johnson House at 8 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday night, the Hawaiian Club is sponsoring a Luau 
        Theme Dinner in the Moulton Union Dinning Hall, complete with imported 
        authentic Hawaiian flowers. After eating your fill of tasty Hawaiian cuisine, 
        Hawaii Ohana: A real Polynesian Fire Dancer will perform at 8p.m. in the 
        Smith Union. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing with the theme of food, the head chef from Mt. 
        Fuji, the popular restaurant in Portland, will give a sushi demonstration 
        in order to enrich the Japanese theme of the week. Prior to this event, 
        Professor Conlon will be speaking about the cultural banquets, food and 
        drinks of Japan. This fascinating combination will take place at 8 p.m. 
        in Daggett Lounge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On Thursday evening in the Smith Auditorium the film "The 
        Legends of the Drunken Master" with Jackie Chan is scheduled. In addition, 
        Marshal Arts Teachers and students have been invited to perform. Discussions 
        will follow about contemporary Chinese issues with some of Bowdoin's professors. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The ASA has decided to bring back Professor Olds to campus, 
        in order to give his annual lecture on Japanese Tea Ceremonies. This year, 
        with the International Club in charge of the event, teas and desserts 
        from around the world will be showcased, reflecting a more inclusive mentality. 
        Friday night will also be home to Game Night, highlighting Chinese, Korean, 
        and Japanese games. All of this starts at 7:30p.m. in Daggett Lounge. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For the seventh year, Saturday night marks the Annual ASA 
        Fashion Show. Emelie Schlegel is running the show, with a somewhat different 
        flavor this year, and it is anticipated to be one of the best. One highlight 
        of the evening is the reappearance of the Boston University Fusion fly 
        girls. The Fashion Show begins at 9 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The culminating event of the whole week is the "Basement 
        Bahangra" at 7 Boody Street, sponsored by ANOKHA. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the changes made to this year's Asian Week schedule, 
        Zeke reflected, "All of the Asian groups worked very well this year. It 
        is because of the help from these groups, with particularly strong leadership 
        in the freshman classes, that Asian week has a more open-minded flavor 
        this year. We hope this week demonstrates a side of Asian culture that 
        hasn't been expressed previously at Bowdoin. We hope our changes and our 
        efforts mark the beginning of an evolution of cultural groups at Bowdoin."</p>
