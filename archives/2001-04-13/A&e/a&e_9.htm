      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This weekend, we celebrate the films of Tom Hanks, a true 
        acting legend. Tom has made some great films: Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, 
        Apollo 13, Saving Private Ryan, The Green Mile, Cast Away, to name a few. 
        But he hasn't always been that way. You see, Tom got his start making 
        really bad, stupid movies. With titles like: He Knows You Are Alone, Bachelor 
        Party, Dragnet, Punchline, and Turner and Hooch, Tom has made himself 
        a hero to everyone who likes skeletons in the closet and a mildly embarrassing 
        past. With this weekend, we hope to bring you a good mix of both stages 
        of Tom's career and will leave it up to you to decide which part you enjoy 
        more. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Film Studies department has requested that I mention 
        a special event here: Eric Schaefer of Emerson College will be giving 
        a lecture entitled "'Other' Images of America: The Case of Exploitation 
        Film" on Thursday the 19th at 8pm in Searles 315. He is the author of 
        "Bold! Daring! Shocking! True! A History of the Exploitation Film, 1919-1959." 
        His lecture will reference two films, Glen or Glenda (1953) and Marihuana 
        (1936), which will be screened by the Film Studies department.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; All the films will be shown in Smith Auditorium, Sills, Hall 
        and are free and open to the public.</p>
      <p>Friday at 7pm <br>
        <i>Big</i> (1988) <br>
        Directed by: Penny Marshall <br>
        Starring: Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, Robert Loggia, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        John Heard, John Lovitz, David Moscow, Jared Rushton <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Big was Tom's first A-list star vehicle (up until this point, 
        all his films were B-movies or ensemble pieces). The story concerns a 
        12-year-old boy who wishes "to be big." The next morning, he wakes up 
        to discover that he is now an adult, but in body only. He still has the 
        same curiosity and mind of a 12-year-old. He now must go out into the 
        real world and live as an adult. The way Tom plays this role, and the 
        story in general, gives a humorous look at life through the eyes of a 
        kid forced into the big world. <b>Rated PG </b></p>
      <p>Friday at 9pm <br>
        <i>Splash</i> (1984) <br>
        Directed by: Ron Howard <br>
        Starring: Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah, Eugene Levy, John Candy <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After Bosom Buddies and a low-budget horror film, this was 
        Tom's first major media exposure. He plays a man who, as a young child, 
        was saved from drowning by a mermaid. Later, as an adult, the same thing 
        happens again, and the same mermaid comes to his rescue. She then decides 
        to find him in the real world, and lets her tail dry out to become a pair 
        of legs. She finds Tom, and they fall in love, but only then does he realize 
        what this woman really is. The entire cast is really good in this film 
        and Howard's direction makes this a top-notch 80's comedy. <b>Rated PG 
        </b></p>
      <p>Saturday at 7pm <br>
        <i>Forrest</i> <i>Gump</i> (1994) <br>
        Directed by: Robert Zemeckis <br>
        Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Philadelphia made Tom a star, but Forrest Gump made him a 
        superstar. Like Big, Tom plays an innocent man who enters into the world 
        and has encounters with famous people and influences numerous historic 
        events. OK, so it may be sappy at times and extremely impossible and occasionally 
        inaccurate, but this is a very enjoyable movie. Tom really becomes Forrest 
        and you forget all about his star persona as you become engrossed in the 
        film. Everyone has probably already seen this movie, but we couldn't have 
        a Tom Hanks weekend without at least one of his Oscar winning roles. <b>Rated 
        PG-13 </b></p>
      <p>Saturday, a little after 9pm <br>
        <i>Volunteers</i> (1985) <br>
        Directed by: Nicholas Meyer <br>
        Starring: Tom Hanks, John Candy, Rita Wilson, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Tim Thomerson, Gedde Watanabe, George Plimpton <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Tom plays a snobby rich gambler who has way too many debts 
        to pay off. His father won't help him out, so he joins the Peace Corps 
        to get away from his creditors. Once in Southeast Asia, he has to help 
        build a bridge with two serious volunteers. The three soon discover that 
        this is a very special bridge that many groups want to control (including 
        the Communists and a drug lord). This really isn't seen as a good film, 
        but so what? We can't let Mr. Hanks get all high and mighty on us. Even 
        the best actors had to make some sub-par films before they gained worldwide 
        fame. This is definitely one of those films. <b>Rated R</b> </p>
      <p>Tuesday at 9:30pm <br>
        Wednesday at 10pm <br>
        <i>Marihuana</i> (1936) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is one of those famous films that shows the dangers 
        faced if young people are allowed to act freely. This time around an evil 
        man (you can tell he's evil because of his mustache) gives some kids marijuana 
        to smoke. Soon they go to a beach, enjoy some fun naked time, but then 
        problems ensue. People start to die...or worse, as the film leads you 
        to believe. This is up there with Reefer Madness in terms of a film completely 
        missing its mark in preventing drug use. </p>
      <p>Tuesday at 10:30pm <br>
        Wednesday at 11pm <br>
        <i>Glen</i> <i>or</i> <i>Glenda</i> (1953) <br>
        Directed by: Ed Wood <br>
        Starring: Ed Wood, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi, Lyle Talbot, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Timothy Farrell, Conrad Brooks <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is Ed Wood's first film, and it's a classic. Taking 
        the name Daniel Davis, he casts himself in the autobiographical role of 
        a man who enjoys wearing women's clothing. Everything about the film may 
        be technically horrible (acting, writing, direction, etc.) but the film 
        is so much fun you won't even notice. Fans of Tim Burton's Ed Wood will 
        want to check this out, as it is one of the three films featured in Burton's 
        movie. </p>
