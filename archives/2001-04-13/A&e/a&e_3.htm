      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently hanging in the fishbowl of the Visual Arts Center, 
        technically known as the first floor, is the student art show "A Ballyhoo 
        Banquet" containing works by seniors Anthony Dalseth and Travis Ritchie. 
        If you're asking yourself what is a "Ballyhoo Banquet," welcome to the 
        club. While I thoroughly enjoyed several of the pieces that comprise this 
        show I felt lost looking at it. While I'm sure that there was some overall 
        motive and message that the artists were intending to impart it was not 
        one that I could discern. Both artists were unavailable for comment.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I felt that the show would have benefited greatly from some 
        sort of explanation. A simple paragraph or two at the beginning of the 
        display explaining where the photographs were taken, the intentions behind 
        the displays, and the ways in which the sculptures fit with the photographs 
        would have done wonders for my viewing experience.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a firm believer that it is a good thing when a piece 
        of art can prompt questions but too often the question that came to my 
        mind was, "What am I looking at?" That being said, it is worth the five 
        minutes or so that it will take you to walk through the VAC and view this 
        relatively small show. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The sculptures were my favorite part of the show; even if 
        I don't understand their context they were aesthetically pleasing. I was 
        particularly taken by the four-foot match constructed entirely out of 
        standard matchsticks, and the miniature wire tree that anchored the collection. 
        Also physically interesting were "Dream-catcher" and "Prison of Color", 
        large physical sculptures that captured the eye. Both of them left me 
        thinking that there was some intended meaning that was just beyond my 
        grasp; perhaps there was, perhaps there will be for you. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Moving from the sculptures to the photographs will be a bit 
        of a jump. They are interspersed in their display but again I cannot understand 
        their connection. The photographs could really have used a little background. 
        They are of a mix of everyday and ceremonial scenes from rural villages 
        in some mountainous Asian country (Nepal perhaps?). I liked the idea of 
        mixing black and white shots with color ones and in some instances the 
        artists manage to create a pleasing juxtaposition. The best example being 
        the colorful and lively picture that directly precedes the three-shot 
        black and white work entitled "Funeral". The life and color of the ceremony, 
        whatever it may be, contrast won derfully with the somber shades of gray 
        in the funeral series. Perhaps my favorite shot in the show is the middle 
        photograph of "Funeral"; it is of a young boy playing a drum in some part 
        of the funeral ceremony. He has been isolated with depth-of-field work 
        and the viewer is somehow drawn to him, and wonders who he is and what 
        role he is playing. Only one other set of pictures intrigued me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It was an untitled (the lack of titles was disturbing, "untitled" 
        wasn't even posted with such works) set of two photographs with a color 
        shot hanging over a black and white one. The subjects in each shot were 
        elderly with the top picture being composed entirely of old men and the 
        lower one of old women. In both images two small trees or logs divide 
        the photograph and give the two of them similar compositions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The final part of the show is a movie showing in continuous 
        loop at the end of the hung art. The movie simply isn't worth your time. 
        Watch a minute or two and you have seen the entire thing and can happily 
        continue on. The most striking thing in the movie, which is shot either 
        on or to look like an old reel to reel home movie and is silent, are the 
        mountains in the background. The villagers in the movie are worn like 
        the mountains and land that they inhabit. The movie is silent, jumpy, 
        and much too plain to be as long as it is. While this is certainly not 
        the most interesting show I have seen here at Bowdoin, there are some 
        enjoyable pieces and considering the small size of the show it wouldn't 
        hurt you to stop by. </p>
