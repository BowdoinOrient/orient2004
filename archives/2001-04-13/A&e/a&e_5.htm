      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have eaten, checked your mail, or just generally 
        existed at Bowdoin during the past week, you have undoubtedly noticed 
        signs for Michael "Tug" Buse's '01 upcoming film, Resurrecting Reconstruction. 
        The publicity blitz was engineered by the savvy Mrs. Buse (don't worry, 
        ladies, Tug isn't hitched just yet-I'm talking about his mother), who, 
        along with Tug's dad, is visiting for the documentary's premiere; slated 
        to air this Saturday, 5 p.m., in Smith Auditorium in Sills Hall. If you 
        cannot attend at that time, take heart, and read on, nonetheless, since 
        Tug's film will air on BCN in the near future, and is already on reserve 
        at the Language Media Center. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The film surveys the "ways in which the story of Reconstruction 
        has been used throughout time," examining the construction of historical 
        memory, "why people select and use certain bits of information to tell 
        a story, and neglect others." The period of Reconstruction, for those 
        with only sketchy middle school notions of it, lasted from 1865, when 
        the Civil War ended, until 1877, when Rutherford Hayes was elected in 
        dubious (read: Dubya-esque) fashion.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Tug's film will trace presentations of the period right from 
        the end of the nineteenth century up to the present. He explores its portrayal 
        from two perspectives, that of popular culture and academia. While the 
        academic portrayal has tended, especially in recent years, to stress the 
        struggle by African-Americans to achieve basic civil rights during this 
        time, popular history has often tainted accounts of the period with often 
        varyingly veiled racism. Tug's film will highlight the blatant discrimination 
        in films like The Birth of a Nation as well as the more covert, and hence 
        more dangerous according to Tug, racism in popular favorites like Gone 
        With the Wind.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This film is the culmination of Tug's Honors Project, and 
        really his collegiate long academic and artistic interests. Tug offers 
        great praise to Professor Rael of the history department for both encouraging 
        him to pursue this non-traditional format, as well as massaging the minds 
        of other history professors to make them receptive to the film media. 
        Recounts Tug, "[Professor Rael and I] had to frame an argument not just 
        for the project but for the medium of the project. And we chose this one 
        because we wanted to break the loop of professional historians and get 
        an idea out there in an accessible medium.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Several prominent historians that I read, said that high 
        school and college students can identify the era of Reconstruction least 
        of all the periods of American history. And what I hope this project does, 
        is reopen a dialog, because it is a crucial part of American history that 
        has been denied its proper place. It's really been resigned to the vault 
        of denial because it doesn't fit with the dominant narratives we tell 
        about freedom, progress, and justice."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The film will last just under an hour and half, so while 
        it resembles Ken Burns' Civil War in form, it is an eminently manageable 
        time commitment. The film, narrated by Tug, features numerous film clips 
        and photos making it very visually stimulating. Moreover, it features 
        voice-overs from a host of Bowdoin students lending expression to the 
        words of historians, poets, and famous figures of the time.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the historical appreciation he gained, Tug's 
        filmmaking knowledge also increased dramatically through the making of 
        Resurrecting Reconstruction. He "really started getting a feeling of where 
        to cut, to keep a rhythm so the images change and the piece moves ahead." 
        During the production period Tug watched the work a full 24 times. As 
        he tells it, if he can sit through it that many times without becoming 
        bored, his peers should probably be able to sit through a single showing. 
        It seems Tug will pull in a sizeable population of students, and if he 
        does so he might just accomplish a task even more monumental than the 
        researching and filming of this project, the resurrection of Bowdoin students 
        extra-classroom academic intrigue. </p>
