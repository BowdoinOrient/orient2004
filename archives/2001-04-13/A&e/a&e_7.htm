      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The gym and I made our first acquaintance this week. Ever. 
        I have always been a bit wary of said "gym". And I've always known it 
        was going to be a disaster the day I finally made it there. There's just 
        something…awry about the place. Hence an impressive attendance of 0/400 
        in the past two years here. Anyways, here is the tale of my inaugural 
        visit to the gym. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Down the long narrow hall I walk very slowly, surrounded 
        by smiling pictures of girls and boys who live for fitness and sport, 
        and I wonder, am I honestly going to enter into this realm of Bowdoin 
        that I have never even attempted to be a part of before, and furthermore 
        that I really disagree with? The smell of sweat, mingled with angry boy 
        music from the left and something upbeat and mainstream from the right, 
        is almost enough to send me running back to my guitar, my paintbrushes, 
        my tapestries, my safe and art filled world. But something goads me on.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; How can I succumb to this? Will I really become one of them? 
        Do I care about my body that much? Can I really walk in there to all the 
        appraising stares (and "stairs"…ha ha…so hilarious sometimes) and in the 
        end feel good about myself? I know the answer is a resounding "NO"; however, 
        the floating image of my Spring Gala dress looms ominously in my mind 
        and it's little evil black lace fingers take that "No" and twist it menacingly 
        until finally it is a misshapen "Yes" with little black lace tendrils 
        hanging from it. My imagination is not only overactive, it is unfortunately 
        interactive and opinionated. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; At this moment the Man Room opens up and a sweating hairy 
        beast of a boy emerges. Oh super. This man has probably exerted himself 
        in the past 45 minutes more than I have in 20 years of existence. As an 
        emu must feel to a stegosaurus, so I to this man. I am a big awkward bird 
        that cannot fly, and he is hulking, spiked, and has an intriguingly small 
        head. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, to my surprise he begins to walk towards me and opens 
        the door to the room that I am so lamely waiting outside of. Feeling self-conscious 
        my mind races for a story to tell him to explain myself. I…am…waiting 
        for a friend! Yes. Good. No! Why would I then be in my workout clothes? 
        Oh no, we are going to go on a run. I don't do the gym thing. I naturally 
        keep myself in shape. None of this climbing up stairs that have no end. 
        Cecili and I are going on a run, out where we belong, communing with the 
        Earth! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Mid conversation-in-my-head, Steg brushes past me and marches 
        with a determined look in his eye into the Woman Room. I experience a 
        brief moment of idiocy as I think to myself "Julianna, you stupid Emu, 
        no one cares about your being at the gym as much as you think they do. 
        In fact they don't care at all." And I nod to myself, knowing that I am 
        right. And then I slip in quietly behind Steg so that no one will notice 
        me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Stealthily, head down, I sneak into the gym, clinging to 
        the Hulk's alarmingly large shadow. I'm just going to head straight for 
        whatever machine is open, figure out how it works while I "stretch" and 
        just do it. No one cares about me as much as I think they do. I am making 
        up this feeling of intense unwelcomeness in my head. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Taking a deep breath I boldly lift my head to look around 
        at what I'm up against, but to my horrified surprise become dizzy and 
        disoriented, surrounded not by the typical gym buffs, but by a swirling 
        mass of people that I never thought would be in here. Isn't that girl 
        in BOCA? Heeeeyyyy, I whine in my head, she should be artsy too! No, and 
        that guy over there is in the orchestra! You can't play tuba and go to 
        the gym! This is horrible. I am realizing that perhaps I am the only person 
        at Bowdoin who does not work out. Something is wrong. If I am the only 
        person, shouldn't I be like a gelatinous mass, unable to get out of my 
        chair, resigned always to roll myself blob-self down the stairs to dinner? 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Julianna?? Ha ha. No."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I look over to find myself face to face with that "friend" 
        who revels in the fact that while I am artsy, she is extremely athletic 
        and could basically kick my ass at any given time. I have no words. I 
        feel like a emu caught in the headlights. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "I. Well. There was Steg, and I was there, and here I am, 
        and hooo, well, time to go."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Come on Julianna! Don't feel uncomfortable. I just didn't 
        think you owned shorts. Har har."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Ohhhhh, I hate you and your over-exercised man laugh. "Well, 
        I do own shorts, Jen, and…" And what? I hate arguments that aren't really 
        arguments because the other person is pretending to be jovial, but they 
        are really being manipulating and purposefully saying things to get under 
        my skin, and I just want to stick up for myself, but they'll just be like 
        "Hey, someone's a little sensitive today, eh?" And then I will be this 
        boiling, ticking, ball of rage, but unable to let anything out because 
        then I am sensitive and I lose, and they win, and they know it. Oh, the 
        injustice.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, Jen, I was the captain of my Volleyball team in 
        high school." Good one, Julianna. Pull out the fact that no one ever believes, 
        and usually provokes more laughter than awe. Granted, I'm not the "strongest" 
        girl, and sometimes I "can't open the cereal bins in the dining hall", 
        but I was the captain of the volleyball team, and I can't stand that no 
        one believes me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, I bet you were. Such a kidder, Julianna." I am seething. 
        Kid this, you manly… "Jules, do you want me to show you how to use any 
        of this stuff? I can imagine it's a bit overwhelming, and you do look 
        a little lost if you don't mind me saying so."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; No, I really actually like it a lot when you say so. You 
        don't mind me saying that you have Man Hands, right? I thought not. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I'm fine. I'm waiting for the elliptical trainer."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; She smiles condescendingly. "You mean the Pre-Core?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Angry. Ticking. Ball. Of RAGE. No, when I said "elliptical 
        trainer" I in fact meant "woolly mammoth" because I am just that stupid 
        when it comes to exercise. I just want to cry, or walk out of this gym. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But then, then, Fate smiled upon me, because I am sure Fate 
        was not athletic either. With a job like being Fate, you have to have 
        some creative room in your head and could not possibly have time for obsessive, 
        self-centered working out. I am thinking of being Fate. Jen wouldn't make 
        fun of me then because I'd be like "Bam, you have genital herpes from 
        now until forever." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, whoever is currently Fate, apparently hates Jen 
        and the gym too, because at that moment an amazingly attractive male-friend 
        of mine poked his head in the door and said "Hey, Julianna, I'm going 
        to take a romantic walk behind the field house, because I am a wonderful 
        and spontaneous person and I enjoy life, and I was wondering if you would 
        like to join me because you are looking radiant in your workout clothes. 
        Oh and hey, I also think Jen has Man Hands." To which I shot one last 
        contemptuous look at Jen and then sauntered, completely self-satisfied 
        out of the gym, never to return again. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Hooray for the "fictional" in "a fictional series."</p>
