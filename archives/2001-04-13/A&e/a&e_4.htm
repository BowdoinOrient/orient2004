      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; On Tuesday night, Michael S. Harper, distinguished poet 
        and visiting Tallman Professor of English, did Bowdoin students the profound 
        courtesy of letting them poke around in his head, figuratively speaking, 
        of course.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Harper's intent was to explain in some small way the creative 
        process that goes into writing poetry by revealing his inspirations, opening 
        for the audience what he called "a notebook of influence." His talk was 
        part lecture and part recital: he would tell a short anecdote, and then 
        read either a poem or prose selection of his own that resulted from his 
        experience, or a work by another author that sparked his contemplation 
        in the first place. A considerable crowd came to listen to this unique 
        blend; Daggett Lounge was almost completely full, a fact made more noteworthy 
        when one considers that a controversial lecture on pornography was being 
        delivered across campus at the same time.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Expectations were high while the audience waited for Harper 
        to take the podium, and were only raised following President Edwards's 
        eloquent introduction. Joe "Frozen Tundra" Blunda '02 perfectly captured 
        the mood of the audience when he proclaimed prior to the talk, "This ought 
        to be good."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When Harper himself, bedecked in a resplendent royal blue 
        beret, began speaking, he instantly won over the audience with his novel 
        perspective on life. As he said before reading his poem "Use Trouble," 
        "I have spent my life making mistakes which my disposition predated for 
        me, and I am pleased."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Harper read quite a bit from his own work, but he also read 
        from some of his inspirations, such as Ralph Ellison. He read a selection 
        from The Invisible Man, and then gave it even more meaning by telling 
        a moving story of how Ellison wept upon hearing the same passage recited 
        by a young student.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In describing how he arrived at the subject for a poem, Harper 
        managed to give the audience a good idea of what can be an inspiration: 
        anything. His anecdotes ranged in topic from Paul Robeson to a bad professor 
        he once had in college to the hurricane that levelled Galveston, Texas 
        in 1900.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Harper also attempted to illuminate the process of writing 
        poetry, but at this he seemed to be less successful, only being able to 
        say that when trying to find the words for a poem, he has "no set agenda," 
        but instead merely "lets them come."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; After he had finished, three stories stood out in particular 
        for their vibrancy and poignancy. The first was about his daughter. He 
        shared her nickname for him, "Nasty," and a letter she wrote to Ralph 
        Ellison on his birthday. Harper then read a poem she wrote upon receiving 
        a reply, and it was clear that she was profoundly moved.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The second was a prose recollection of his days in graduate 
        school in Iowa. He narrated how he had trouble finding housing because 
        of the segregation at the time, and how this segregation almost made him 
        drop out. The most arresting point of the story was when he described 
        spending most of his time in the library simply because it was the warmest 
        building on campus. A story like that has a particular effect on a college 
        campus where every person has a warm room and a full meal to expect every 
        night.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The third was remarkable simply for its brevity. He told 
        how his mother had died in 1988, and how he never thought that he would 
        be able to write about it, but suddenly was struck one day and wrote a 
        poem. The poem he read was short and beautiful, using imagery of harps 
        of a thousand strings to transmit the feeling of his love for his mother.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;When an author is willing to bare his or her soul, revealing 
        his or her deepest feelings, it is undeniably a powerful thing. Harper 
        did just that on Tuesday night, and Bowdoin students realized how lucky 
        they were to have had such an opportunity to listen. Joe "Thunda" Blunda, 
        again capturing the mood of the crowd, said it best: "Honest and poignant, 
        as promised. I feel fortunate to have been in the audience." </p>
