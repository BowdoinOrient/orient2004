      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past week has seen the Bowdoin baseball team continue 
        its recent run of solid--albeit unspectacular--play managing to split 
        contests with in-state rival St. Joseph's College and a struggling UMass-Boston 
        squad. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still flummoxed by the realization that Spring in Maine 
        may be a forgotten entity, the team was forced to travel all the way to 
        Tufts last Thursday to tackle a 15-1 St. Joseph's juggernaut. The Polar 
        Bears battled admirably before yielding the eventual go-ahead run in the 
        top of the eighth inning and falling by a count of 3-2. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolstered by an excellent outing from sophomore Jared 
        Porter, Bowdoin trailed just 1-0 heading into the fifth inning. In the 
        fifth, Kevin Bougie '04, last week's NESCAC player of the week, was hit 
        by a pitch, and senior tri-captain Greg Lovely followed with a sharp single. 
        After Andy Workman '04 sacrificed to move the runners, senior tri-captain 
        Joe Nicastro-evoking images of an erstwhile Jody Reed-delivered handsomely, 
        roping a two-run single to give the Polar Bears a slight 2-1 edge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the lead would only hold up until two 
        innings later when the Monks managed to square the contest before eventually 
        pulling ahead in the decisive eighth frame.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday afternoon proved to be considerably more fruitful 
        for a Polar Bear squad with aspirations to get back to .500. After a six-day, 
        weather-induced layoff, the team again took to the road, this time journeying 
        down to Boston to tango with a 6-12 University of Massachusetts at Boston 
        squad. On a day that the Polar Bears admittedly didn't play their best 
        baseball, Greg Lovely managed to carry the day by crushing a 10th inning 
        homer en-route to an exciting 8-5 victory. The win brings the Bowdoin 
        record to an even 8-8.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freshman J.P. Hernandez (1-0) was stellar in relief, 
        picking up his first victory of the season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin Coach Michael Connolly offered the following: 
        "We're not always going to play as well as we'd like, so it's important 
        to find some way to step up and gut out the close games. Yesterday, Lovely 
        and Hernandez helped us do that." </p>
