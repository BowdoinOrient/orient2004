      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the seasons change from winter to spring, the women's 
        track team is still in training for itsrespective events. Although the 
        change in season may not seem to be a big change to the average person, 
        all you track and field fanatics are well aware of what this change in 
        season entails.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the track, runners will have the opportunity to compete 
        in longer races. Senior co-captain Erin Lyman's cross country and winter 
        season has left her ready for her favorite race: the 10K (6.2 miles). 
        Jeanie Boudreau, also a senior co-captain, will also run a distance event: 
        the 3000m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She said of the team, "It is really great to train 
        with people who are so dedicated. Many of the women have been training 
        since November, and even though our meet was canceled last weekend, everyone 
        is enthusiastic about this upcoming meet. The women seem confident about 
        this season after working so hard throughout the winter season."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the running events change in distance because 
        the 600m and 55m dash are no longer run. However, the 100m dash and the 
        400m hurdles are new running events that our sprinters and hurdlers have 
        been preparing for. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring presents a whole new world for our throwers. 
        They are no longer confined solely to the shot put and the 20lb. weight. 
        Though the weight is not one of the spring field events, the hammer, discus, 
        and javelin are all welcome additions to the throwing realm. Shannon Elf 
        '03 has been training since the winter season solely for the javelin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women's track team has been out in San Diego training 
        hard over spring break to prepare for their rigorous season. The first 
        official meet of the season will be held at Colby next Saturday where 
        they will compete against rivals Colby, Bates, and MIT. Last season the 
        women finished up 38-11 for the season. They claimed the ECAC title and 
        placed fifth out of 26 teams in New England.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the toughest competition they will face throughout 
        this season will be Middlebury. This team has provided Bowdoin with tough 
        competition throughout the indoor season that will most likely not relent 
        during the spring. The next meet is at Northeastern against Bates, Colby, 
        and MIT. </p>
