      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As predicted last week, Babson <i>does</i> equal joke. 
        The Polar Bears won all of their matches against the Babson squad, with 
        a final tally of 8-0. There were notable victories by several of Bowdoin's 
        players, especially the doubles team of Nicolas MacLean '03 and Edward 
        Holmes '04. The Babson team of MacDonald and Madhaven didn't score a point 
        against Bowdoin's number two doubles team. The final score of the match 
        was 8-0.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, there were several impressive plays by 
        Bowdoin's singles players. August Felker '03 won his match against Sebastion 
        Weigert with scores of 6-0 and 6-1. First-year John Carolan, who plays 
        number four singles, won his match 6-2, 6-1. Andy Miness '03 also had 
        the same results of 6-2, 6-1 against Scott MacDonald, playing number six 
        singles. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Polar Bears did not do quite as well 
        against MIT. The Engineers got away with a slim victory, beating Bowdoin 
        4-3. "It was a tough loss, tough loss," said sophomore Louis Plough. There 
        were several heart-breaking matches. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polar Bear's number one single's player, Colin Joyner 
        '03, who enjoys ethnic drumming, lost his match, but not without a struggle. 
        After losing the first set 3-6, Joyner came back to win his second 6-2. 
        His third set was incredibly close with a score of 7-6 in favor of MIT. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number one doubles team of Joyner and Felker had 
        a very close match as well. They lost with a score of 9-7. Bowdoin's number 
        two and three doubles teams fortunately won their matches. MacLean and 
        Holmes left the court victoriously with a score of 8-5 in favor of Bowdoin. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat Soong '04 and Miness did the same. MacLean won his 
        singles match. He played number three against Marco Hernandez, winning 
        the match in two games of 7-5 and 6-2. Carolan won his singles match as 
        well. He lost his first game but came back to win the second two games 
        6-2 and 7-6. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After last weekend's tough loss to MIT, the men's tennis 
        team is definitely ready to get their game back. Luckily, they'll have 
        that chance today when they play Tufts at Bowdoin at 4 pm. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can't make it to that game, then be sure to 
        cheer them on this weekend when they play Middlebury and NYU. Both games 
        are being played here at Bowdoin, at 10 am on Saturday and Sunday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you absolutely must miss those games then get ready 
        for next Wednesday. What could be so exciting? A chance to watch the studs 
        of men's tennis kill Colby. </p>
