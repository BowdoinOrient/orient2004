      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are really in for a treat this week boys and girls. 
        It's your chance to meet Bowdoin's version of Bo Jackson (that's right, 
        the original two-sport superstar). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Greg Lovely is a little different than Bo though. 
        Greg knows golf and basketball and baseball and he knows them all well--captaining 
        all three. There are plenty of two-sport athletes on the Bowdoin campus, 
        but Lovely takes it another step; when you see him, chances are he's in 
        season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year begins for Lovely on the beautiful golf courses 
        of New England where he leads the Polar Bears squad into action. The captain 
        of the golf team, he led the squad this season with an 81.4 stroke average 
        and guided the team to the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin (CBB) Championship. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Coach Terry Meagher, "Greg was one of the 
        main reasons that we had a successful and enjoyable season." Coach Meagher 
        also commented on Lovely's sense of humor and "deep respect" for the game.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it gets too cold for the golf course Lovely moves 
        into the gym where, after taking off his freshman year, he has been an 
        integral part of the Bowdoin basketball program despite limited playing 
        time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After a year away," said Lovely "I really missed the 
        team aspect. Plus, my brother was on the team, and I had never been able 
        to play basketball with him before.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After that first year back playing, I just caught 
        the bug again and couldn't walk away." Lovely called playing with his 
        brother an unforgettable experience; "It was great to get the chance to 
        play on the same team before he graduated. Since we were also both on 
        the golf team, I did get to beat up on him in at least one sport while 
        we were here." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach Tim Gilbride says of the talented tri-sport athlete, 
        "Greg is a natural leader with a strong work ethic. He has played an instrumental 
        role in the success of our basketball team throughout his career. I am 
        sure that there are not very many individuals who have served as captain 
        of three different sports during their careers."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spring season finds Lovely on the baseball diamond, 
        captaining the Bowdoin squad for the second straight year from his shortstop 
        position. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the weather is currently wreaking havoc 
        with their schedule Lovely is happy with the way the team is playing and 
        sees good things for the future of the program. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have a lot to learn," he said "but I think 
        we're definitely heading in the right direction fast." Coach Mike Connolly 
        spoke highly of Lovely, praising his leadership both on and off the field; 
        "He is dedicated to making the team and himself better on a daily basis." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three sports-you might ask, isn't that an awful lot 
        of work and time commitment? How'd he end up playing all three? The answer 
        is simple really, Lovely never felt like concentrating in a single sport. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I decided to come to a college where I would have the 
        opportunity to continue at least two." He said, he then decided that he 
        couldn't stay away from the gym either and so three it has been. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely credits athletics with a huge role in his Bowdoin 
        experience, saying, "With the chance to play on three different teams, 
        I've had the opportunity to become friends with a lot of different people. 
        Sports have also forced me to learn to budget my time so I still have 
        time for everything else that's important to me at Bowdoin. Plus, the 
        constant competition has taught me how to deal with different situations 
        and be able to adjust on the fly."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the experience of athletics there are 
        the people involved and Lovely gave due credit to all three of his coaches 
        and his many teammates in helping make him who he is today. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Coaches Connolly, Meagher, and Gilbride are all similar 
        in one key aspect. They all take an interest in the lives of their players 
        both on and off the fields. An opportunity never passes when they don't 
        try to give some helpful advice on how to make yourself a better athlete, 
        but more importantly a better person," said Lovely.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he didn't 'fess up to any particular superstitions 
        or role models he did mention that he was a big Red Sox fan and admired 
        both Pedro and Nomar (if you don't know what I'm talking about you shouldn't 
        be reading this article). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He's superstitious when it comes to sports, saying, 
        "If I think something may have played a role in a previous win, you can 
        bet I will be doing the same thing the next game."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely, a Spanish major, has no immediate plans for 
        next year although he is considering returning for a year as an assistant 
        baseball coach. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what he does, Lovely has left his mark 
        all over the Athletic department. <br>
