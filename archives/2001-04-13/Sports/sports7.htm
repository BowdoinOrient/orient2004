      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite some undesirable practice conditions and a 
        loss or two along the way, the men's lacrosse team is looking toward a 
        successful season. It recently took a 13-8 loss at Wesleyan last weekend, 
        but recovered to dominate Bates 7-3 on Tuesday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For us, it's been a matter of being stuck indoors all 
        the time. It's been the spring from hell," head coach Tom McCabe said. 
        "The only time we get to be outdoors is when we travel to play." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men journeyed south for vacation, like most spring 
        sports teams. Needless to say, the conditions in New Port Richey, Florida 
        were a bit better than in good old Brunswick. "Being outdoors and practicing 
        every day on a full field really helped us," McCabe said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the snow and slush-filled 'real' world, the 
        men have compiled a 3-1 NESCAC record since their return, and are 5-3 
        overall. Last Saturday brought the Bears to Middletown, Connecticut for 
        a meeting with a tough Wesleyan squad. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We ran into a team that was 8-1," Coach McCabe said. 
        "They are the best Wesleyan team I've seen in the past ten years."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the teams exchanged two goals each, the Cardinals 
        (3-0 NESCAC) netted four in a row without counterattack from the Polar 
        Bears, building a 6-2 halftime lead. Despite a 4-2 Bowdoin run in the 
        third frame, Wesleyan ran away with the upset after another set of four 
        unanswered goals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior Hunter Walter's three goals and one assist led 
        game totals for the Bears. Goaltender P.J. Prest '02 made 20 saves in 
        the loss, while the Cardinal's Lukas Cash saved 17. "We made some unforced 
        errors, and against a good team, you can't do that," McCabe stated.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears recovered on Tuesday for a trip up to Bates 
        (4-5, 1-4 NESCAC). The game's third quarter proved to be a critical one, 
        in which senior captains Alex Ellis and Wendell Simonson both scored goals. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bart McMann '03 contributed one of his own to push the 
        lead to 7-2 at the end of the frame. Bates managed one additional goal 
        in the fourth quarter, but couldn't overcome the Polar Bear lead. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis totaled three goals and an assist in the game, 
        while McMann and Simonson contributed two goals apiece. Prest rejected 
        12 shots from the Bobcats.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Coach McCabe's squad is steadied on 
        a cohesive lineup, with standout contributions from certain players. "We're 
        pretty balanced," McCabe affirmed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Offensively, there is no question that Ellis is our 
        'go-to' guy, but we're pretty teamwork-oriented. We've had very good play 
        from our defensemen, and one of our keys right now is the play we're getting 
        from P.J. Prest in goal."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continued, citing defenseman Mark Caruso '01 and, 
        midfielder Josh Allen '02 for their solid play.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a strong returning lineup, the team hopes to build 
        upon the successes of last season. "We had a great year; ended up 12-3 
        and were ranked 8th in the country," Coach McCabe said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're doing a good job of following it up so far. 
        In Monday's USILA/STYX Division III rankings, Bowdoin was tied for the 
        19th spot in the nation. McCabe indicated that the team is hoping to bring 
        a big game to Middlebury tomorrow for the 1 p.m. match. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right now we're 5-3, and are playing the defending 
        national champs from last season," he said. After Middlebury, the bears 
        do not play again until traveling to Massachusetts for a matchup against 
        the Amherst Lord Jeffs next Saturday. </p>
