      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softball broke the streak! They not only played two 
        scheduled games, they also proved that they could win after spending two 
        weeks in the field house. Last Saturday, Trinity learned a tough lesson, 
        when, as Captain Gina Laugelli '02 described it, "We took our frustrations 
        with the snow and built them into positive energy." The softball team 
        used its energy to defeat Trinity, 7-1 and 1-0.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first game of the day started the way a softball 
        game should…with 6 (Bowdoin) runs and 8 (Bowdoin) hits in the first two 
        innings. In the top of the first, Captain Megan Wardrop '01 singled and 
        later scored off Hillary Smith's single. Captain Kristie Miller '02 walked 
        to first base, but before Jessie Mayol '02 could hit, Smith '04 and Miller 
        stole second AND third base. Mayol belted out a single and collected two 
        RBIs. Bowdoin pitcher, Erin Hanley '04, faced only three batters in the 
        bottom of the inning. With a little help from her left fielder, Hanley 
        sent three Trinity players back to the bench. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second inning, Bowdoin's dominance continued. 
        Smith singled, advancing Wardrop to third base, and then proceeded to 
        steal second. The Trinity pitcher was frightened by Kristie Miller's batting 
        potential and gave Miller another walk to first base. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jessie Mayol approached the plate with the bases loaded! 
        She delivered a powerful single, which plated Wardrop and Smith and advanced 
        Miller to second. Britney Carr '04 followed Mayol with a single of her 
        own and sent Miller home for the sixth run of the game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trinity cut its deficit to five in the bottom of the 
        second inning, but its efforts could not compete with the SIX Bowdoin 
        runs. The Polar Bears added one more run to their total in the seventh 
        inning when Katie Sheridan '02 scored off Kristie Miller's sacrifice fly. 
        Game 1 ended with a 7-1 Bowdoin victory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The softball team showed last Saturday that it could 
        win games at the beginning and the end of games. The first two innings 
        decided Game One, but it was the top of the eighth inning in Game Two 
        before Bowdoin put Trinity away. On the defensive side, pitchers Jesse 
        Poulin '02 and Laugelli allowed only four hits. When the top of the eighth 
        inning arrived, the Polar Bears were tied 0-0. Erin McDonough '01 singled 
        and moved to second after Trinity walked Sheridan. Smith belted in the 
        winning run with a powerful single. McDonough scored the winning run and 
        Bowdoin walked off the field with an 8-4 overall record (2-0 NESCAC).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wardrop said, "Last weekend proved what our team is 
        made of. We can attack early and break our opponents down, but if the 
        game is close, we can stay mentally tough and pull through at the end."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next game for Polar Bears is supposed to take place 
        this weekend against Hussen, but the game, if played, will not take place 
        at Bowdoin. The teams will meet at a dry, neutral site. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, the softball team is not worried. Wardrop 
        knows that Bowdoin is "A hard team to beat because we know that if we 
        fire it up and do what we are capable of doing, no team has a chance against 
        us." </p>
