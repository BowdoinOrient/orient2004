      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the weatherman tells you that there is a 99.9% 
        chance of rain tomorrow, you know it's going to rain. Sure, there is a 
        slight meteorological chance that it is going to be sunny and dry all 
        day, but you still bring your umbrella and wait for the rain.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Michael Jordan retired in 1993, he vowed that he 
        would never come back, but reneged on that promise in 1995 as he returned 
        to lead the Bulls to three more championships. When His Airness retired 
        for the second time, he claimed that he was 99.9% sure (never saying never) 
        that he would never play again.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March, <i>Sports Illustrated </i>columnist, Rick 
        Reilly, ran an article that said "Don't listen to him. Listen to me." 
        In his column, he divulged that a source close to Jordan said that the 
        NBA legend and currently part owner of the Washington Wizards is "90 percent 
        committed" to selling his share of the team and playing next year. Reilly 
        also cited the fact that Jordan has been spending up to six hours per 
        day working out at a health club, attending Wizards practices, and entertaining 
        the idea of mounting a comeback with his close friend, Charles Barkley. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan's retort? "I am working out because I got up 
        to 240 pounds and I'm trying to lose weight. People are taking this stuff 
        way too far, but I can't control what people write or think so I'm not 
        going to address this anymore."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation: "I am getting fat, lazy, and none of my 
        expensive stylish suits fit me anymore. Plus, my wife and kids have been 
        giving me slack about my ever-expanding gut. I know I said that I left 
        a 0.1% possibly for a comeback after I retired, so I know you guys will 
        be talking about my comeback until I am a senior citizen. I'm not going 
        to be bother to fight this one."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, speculation about Jordan comebacks continue 
        to be the top story in the sporting world. Whenever MJ laces up a pair 
        of sneakers, a new source close to him steps forward asserting that Jordan 
        will play next year. They all have adopted the Reilly attitude, "Don't 
        listen to him. Listen to me."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part-owner of the Washington Wizards, Abe Pollin, 
        jumped on the bandwagon on April 10. Said Pollin "The odds are that he's 
        going to come back. I think he's just deciding whether he's going to be 
        able to play at level that is satisfying to him."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation: "I might be employing some fuzzy math, 
        but I believe that 0.1% means that the odds are in favor of a Jordan comeback. 
        And, when Jordan sells his share of the team to me to play and puts fannies 
        in my arena, I am going to be making a lot of dough."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mario Lemieux, a golfing buddy of Jordan, also staked 
        a spot in the Jordan-is-coming- back-camp. Said Lemieux, "He's going to 
        give it a shot and he's working very hard. He's taking his time. He's 
        taking a few months to get ready, but I'm sure when he gets back, he'll 
        be the best player again."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation: "Jordan sunk a beautiful double-breaking 
        putt on 17, but I had a lucky approach shot on the 18th so I edged him 
        out. He is working on his all-around game and I am sure that when we play 
        after the NHL playoffs, he will be the best between the two of us again."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even MJ's ex-coach and basketball's Zen representative, 
        Phil Jackson, got in the mix. PJ remarked, "I think he's waiting to see 
        what he feels like when he's out there. I think he will have a parachute 
        in case he doesn't want to do it..."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation: "Kobe whines too much and Shaq is so big 
        that he scares me. Michael, please come back for me. Please? I miss you." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-five soccer fans were killed in Johannesburg, 
        South Africa trying to crowd into a packed stadium, Tiger Woods won his 
        own version of the Grand Slam, the NHL and NBA playoffs are gearing up, 
        and Chinese 7 footers are hitting jumpers in the NBA. And yet, these stories 
        are all overshadowed by wishful dreams of the return of a 6'6" basketball 
        god with the sweetest cross-over, nastiest in-air acrobatics, and most 
        crunch-time heroics of any basketball player..... ever.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jordan donned a number 23 Wizards jersey at a team 
        practice earlier this month, reporters swarmed him about questions of 
        a potential comeback once again. When asked if the jersey and his practicing 
        were signals of the third coming of His Airness, he replied "The only 
        thing this signals is that I'm getting some exercise."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation: "Have you seen how fat Charles Barkley 
        has gotten in his retirement? I don't want to be a 350 pound tubby. Alright?" 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this entire speculative exercise, Jordan 
        has maintained that he is still 99.9% committed to staying retired, living 
        in Chicago with his wife and kids, and running the Wizards via telephone.".<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't quite finished my semester of social science, 
        but I know enough that a 99.9% confidence rating is accurate enough to 
        be trusted. And so is Jordan. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for fans, players, and owners the greatest 
        player in NBA history will not be returning next year. </p>
