      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring has finally arrived here in Maine. The snow 
        is melting, the birds are chirping, the buds are budding, and Bowdoin's 
        scholar-athletes, while still awaiting the debut on their home fields, 
        are well into their seasons. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin College Women's Lacrosse Team has started 
        off their 2001 campaign with a respectable 5-2 record. Battling foul weather 
        and a lack of home field advantage, the Lady P-bears have persevered with 
        determination and heart. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team began its season amidst drunken, crazed spring 
        breakers and terrified senior citizens in the picturesque vacation community 
        of Panama City Beach, Florida. Having left the sub-zero Maine temperatures, 
        the Polar Bears were looking forward to all that the Sunshine State had 
        to offer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, rainy practices and frightening college co-eds 
        forced the ladies to take refuge in the dimly lit, yet ever-cozy confines 
        of their hotel. Faced with so much adversity, the average Orient reader 
        might surmise that our ladies of lax were in trouble. But fear not. They 
        took their sour old lemons and made some lip-smackin', sweet-tastin' lemonade! 
        And boy was it grrrrrrrrrrreat!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the weather, the Bowdoin women's two games in 
        Florida were heated. On March 21, the team faced arch-rival East Stroudsburg 
        and emerged victorious with a 13-4 victory. Two days later, after a delicious 
        CONTINENTAL breakfast field-side, they continued their winning streak 
        with a 6-5 overtime win over top-notch foe Hamilton. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boarding the plane after a 2-0 start, our gals were 
        looking forward to returning to the lush green, spring fields of Farley. 
        Alas, their bright, twinkling young eyes soon met the harsh, cold, gray 
        tundra that they had hoped they no longer had to contend with. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah Banister '02, a three-year starter for the Polar 
        Bears, summed up the team's reaction when she quoted that timeless adage, 
        "We just picked up the 'ole spirit stick and ran with it." Well said, 
        Sarah. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In unrelated news, Tanning Express stock prices have 
        shot through the roof since the end of spring break, and many Brunswick 
        residents are celebrating their newfound fortunes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a hard-fought, double overtime loss to the Camels 
        of Conn. College four days prior, the ladies rebounded to defeat Tufts 
        10-6 on April 3. Leading the charge, Lindsay "April showers bring May" 
        Powers '03 tallied four goals and one assist. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junior co-captains Kristi "can I get some cheese with 
        that wine?" Perine and Carrie "harder than diamonds" Simonds scored two 
        and one goals respectively. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shoshanna Kuriloff '04, Kate "braver than Old Yella" 
        Labella '02, and Beth "before she goes fishin', she goes wormin'" Sherman 
        '02 each posted one goal apiece for the Polar Bears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whitney "gives donations at" Church '02 boasted an assist, 
        along with Perine, Sam Hall '01, and Powers. Senior goalie Julia "I love 
        those jokes about brushin' m'hair with" McCombs made seven stellar saves 
        against the Jumbos. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Sorry freshmen. After long serious consideration, we 
        have decided that you shall receive no nicknames in the first article. 
        You must pay your dues. If you want the rainbow kids, you gotta learn 
        how to deal with the rain.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days after their triumphant win over Tufts, our 
        ladies of lax traveled to Harvard for a "home game" against the Cardinals 
        of Wesleyan. The Polar Bears boasted a 6-1 lead over their opponent at 
        the end of the first half of play. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perine led the scoring with three goals, while Hall 
        and Amanda Burrage '04 followed closely with two each. At the close of 
        the game, Bowdoin emerged victorious with a 9-3 final score. McCombs made 
        six saves against the Wesleyan offense. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following their defeat of Wesleyan, the gals traveled 
        to scenic Lewiston for yet another "home game" versus the Williams College 
        Ephs. After a two-hour delay due to the necessary plowing of 387487 feet 
        of overnight snowfall, the lady bears put in a valiant effort against 
        their opponents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, a victory was not in the cards and they 
        suffered a 10-5 loss. Perine, Powers, Sherman, and Burrage each had snipes 
        for the home team and McCombs stopped 11.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming Saturday our ladies of spring will battle 
        powerhouse Middlebury College. It is scheduled as a home match, however 
        the whereabouts of this clash is yet to be determined. Bowdoin's artificial 
        turf field is still nearly one year behind schedule. Til next time, have 
        a good weekend and be safe. </p>
