      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin sailing team had a busy weekend and is 
        preparing for another; the team is sending sailors to seven regattas this 
        weekend. This past weekend was one marked by the gain of both valuable 
        and new experiences. Bowdoin sent sailors to compete in the Ted Ferrarone 
        Team Racing Intersectional at Yale, the Emily Wick Trophy at MIT, the 
        Eastern Series 1 at U.N.H., the Sloop Shrew Trophy at Harvard, and the 
        Invite at B.U. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Yale, sailors learned a great deal, as they competed 
        in team racing, something they have not attempted before. Team racing 
        differs from regular racing in that teams compete against each other by 
        racing three boats each. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scores are determined by the combination of places a 
        team earns. As explained by Melanie Keene '03: "Bowdoin's three boats 
        worked together using advanced tactics trying to keep the opponent from 
        winning the races." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing for Bowdoin were Mitch O'Neill '01 with Keene 
        as crew, Tyler Dunphy '03 with crew Ashley Anderson '03, and Steve Lampert 
        '04 with crew Laura Hutton '04. Although Bowdoin did not earn a top place, 
        participation in the Ted Ferrarone Team Racing Intersectional was a valuable 
        learning experience, especially as the Bowdoin team will be competing 
        in another like regatta in two weeks.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Sloop Shrew Trophy at Harvard, Bowdoin took fifth 
        place, and at the Emily Wick Trophy at MIT, Bowdoin earned an eighth place 
        finish. Shifty wind intensified the difficulty of competing against a 
        field of talented sailors. Ali Binkowski '03, who participated in both 
        regattas, spoke of her team's races: "It was a difficult weekend, but 
        a great learning experience. We are looking forward to some great racing 
        at the Women's Brad Dellenbaugh Trophy at Brown this weekend." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming weekend, Bowdoin will be sending sailors 
        to the Brad Dellenbaugh Trophy at Brown, the Admiral's Cup at Kings Point, 
        the Moody Trophy at U.R.I., B.U. Trophy at B.U., Sloop Invite at Coast 
        Guard, Three Division Invite at Tufts, and the Gibb Trophy at Tufts. </p>
