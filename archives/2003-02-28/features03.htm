        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">On the other front of the Second World War, other U.S. troops 
        were preparing with British and Allied soldiers for the reconquest of 
        Europe. Before the invasion of France, however, their objective was to 
        liberate North Africa. Edwin Rommel, the German Desert Fox had entered 
        that continent earlier in the war and British troops had put up a good 
        fight only to be outgunned and outmaneuvered. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1942, the Allies were not yet ready for a landing on the European continent 
        and since public demand was for fighting and forward movements, North 
        Africa was seen as the best choice. In a joint movement between U.S. and 
        British troops, an Allied offensive was launched near the end of that 
        year-the so called, &quot;Operation Torch.&quot; On October 23, 1942, 
        British, Australian, and New Zealand forces under eccentric General Bernard 
        Montgomery with 150,000 troops struck the Axis lines at El Alamein. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On November 8, U.S. forces landed near Casablanca, opening a second front 
        and pushing German and Italian forces before them. Heavy fighting ensued 
        as Rommel clashed with both British General Montgomery and celebrated 
        American hero General George S. Patton. Even though Allied troops initially 
        lost the race for Tunis, they were eventually victorious, capturing all 
        Axis troops by May 13, 1943.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A month after the Axis capitulation in North Africa, Stanley P. Barron, 
        a Bowdoin graduate-Class of 1940-wrote back President Sills, describing 
        in very few words his impressions of the country: &quot;The most striking 
        comment that I can make of Africa-trite though it may seem-is that its 
        terrifically hot.&quot; This perception of the weather, however, did not 
        dampen his patriotic feelings. &quot;It is of considerable satisfaction,&quot; 
        he wrote, &quot;to feel that one is doing something material and constructive 
        to bring this struggle to an early and successful close.&quot; Other Bowdoin 
        men, such as Orville B. Denison of the Class of 1941 had more time to 
        describe their experiences of Africa:</p>
      <p align="left">
        I am in North Africa, the land of milk and cream. &#133; It is nice here. 
        Warm through the days and comfortable during the nights. And the sun shines 
        every day until winter. Africa is picturesque. &#133; The cities are very 
        much the reciprocal of the rolling country, where the ground is eighty 
        percent barren and where the nomads live in scattered groups of thatch 
        huts and tents located near grazing lands and wells. In the cities it 
        is different. They are experimental in appearance and yet will undoubtedly 
        last into a type of throw-back in architecture. The buildings are far 
        ahead of America, even striving Miami, in simple futurity. But the people 
        are Old-World. All over are the arabs [sic], in their long-skirted robes 
        and hoods, with their beards of varied sizes and shapes, with their women 
        who are hidden in draping folds of cloth except for their eyes. Or their 
        tattooed heels. There are thousands of them in the streets and in the 
        countrysides. The whites are also in appearance, out in the open or, and 
        more often, lounging at the many sidewalk caf&eacute;s with sour beer 
        or flat wine or diesel brandy in jellyjars on their tables. The whole 
        scene with a background of flies.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite these scenes of poverty, Dennison noted that there were also good 
        things for American troops such as U.S. beer and modern plumbing. He concluded:</p>
      <p align="left">
        So this is Africa. Where we had expected Tarzanic jungles we find barbed 
        wire; where we had looked forward to camel safaris we get jeep convoys. 
        And when we get back we'll not wait for grandchildren as audiences to 
        our stories.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With the collapse of Axis control in the region, North Africa was once 
        again a place where Allied troops and civilians could travel with ease. 
        One such place, which was popular to visit was Egypt. From there, George 
        E. Morrison of the Class of 1944, described the beautiful scenery:</p>
      <p align="left">
        To my mind they [pyramids] are what make Egypt so fascinating. Even after 
        having seen them, I can hardly comprehend their antiquity. An American 
        usually looks upon something two or three hundred years old as having 
        quite a history. Therefore he has a little difficulty in trying to realize 
        that he is viewing something which has been standing for thousands of 
        years. Of course I am referring here to man made objects. The Pyramids 
        are wonderful! That does not begin to describe them, but words often cannot 
        express what one feels inside. I was not content to merely gaze upon them, 
        so I undertook to climb the largest Pyramid. It gave me a much better 
        idea of the immense size and I also felt rewarded for my efforts when 
        I saw the view from on top. There is the Nile River, the valley with its 
        green fields, Cairo and best, but certainly not least, the desert. Everything 
        I have heard so much about stretched out before me!</p>
      <p align="left">
        Naturally I saw the Sphinx too. Its face is rather badly worn away, but 
        it is, nevertheless, a great sight.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin men, however, were not limited to combat roles. Robert S. Ecke 
        of the Class of 1931, assigned to North Africa, was one of many medical 
        personnel who were concerned with diseases such as typhus. His perceptions 
        of Africa and Egypt were not as positive as George Morrison's:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Your letter&#133;reached this unattractive part of the world. Oh it is 
        lovely enough to look at. The tourist from Shepherd's porch can call it 
        beautiful. The dying moon aslant the palm fringed Mile- the morning-sun-tinted 
        sails of the feluccas- the picturesque (and evil mannered and worse smelling) 
        camel all make material for the women's clubs but nowhere have I seen 
        such cruelty to men and animal. The worst sweat shop is a Soviet cooperative 
        compared with this wretched society. I grieve at every American item that 
        comes into Egyptian hands. The Beys and Paschas own the bodies and souls 
        and Tammany Hall would seem composed to choir boys and acolites [sic]. 
        &#133; The wickedness in high places is astounding and the higher the 
        wickeder.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were, however, places on the earth, which were filled with greater 
        wickedness. Deep in Germany's European empire the systematic extermination 
        of Jews was being perpetrated under the noses of Allied bombers and reconnaissance 
        fliers while prisoners and captured civilians were being brutally savaged 
        and murdered in the areas still held by the Japanese in the Pacific. </p>
