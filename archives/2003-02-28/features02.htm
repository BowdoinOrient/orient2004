      <p align="left">Professor Helen Cafferty remembers the moment well. She 
        was working in the Dean's office when a friend handed her a slip of paper, 
        much like a president's chief of staff would do in the midst of some grave 
        crisis. &quot;The wall has fallen,&quot; the note ominously read.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It was an amazing, heady time,&quot; she remembers with a smile, 
        and to this day a large poster showing people dancing on the wall before 
        the Brandenburg Gate in November, 1989, hangs behind her desk. Cafferty 
        was in the midst of preparing for a fellowship in East Germany when the 
        Berlin Wall fell, marking the end of decades of division. Despite the 
        geopolitical changes, she continued on with the fellowship, which was 
        to study the relationship between East German authors and their audiences. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Of course, when I arrived, the country wasn't there,&quot; she says. 
        In its place, there was openness and a new acceptance of free speech-but 
        also dislocation and confusion. The sudden changes that she witnessed 
        have allowed Cafferty to appreciate post German unification issues better. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It strengthened my understanding of the social context of what was 
        going on politically,&quot; Cafferty says. Indeed, her love of the German 
        language has bubbled over into a zest for German culture, beginning with 
        literature and more recently including film.</p>
      <p align="left">
        For Cafferty, film is not just about entertainment. It can point to how 
        a society is dealing with its issues, like working through its past in 
        Germany's case. Postwar German film, for example, addresses themes ranging 
        from the Holocaust to communism to feminism. Looking at the strategies 
        films employ can have a &quot;broad resonance&quot; beyond the specific 
        genre, according to Cafferty, who never hesitates asks how a country can 
        &quot;learn from its history.&quot; Her popular German film classes are 
        open to all students, not just German majors, as long as one doesn't mind 
        subtitles.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While Cafferty has witnessed a variety of changes and trends in postwar 
        Germany, she has also seen Bowdoin grow over the past three decades. When 
        she arrived in 1972, there were only three other women faculty members, 
        and the college's commitment to coeducation was just starting to take 
        root. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Indeed, Cafferty counts as one of her greatest pleasures seeing coeducation 
        at Bowdoin become &quot;reality, and not just a promise.&quot; Besides 
        mainstreaming gender issues in her classes, she was also instrumental 
        in establishing the Women's Studies Program in the 1980s. As an Assistant 
        Dean in charge of faculty hiring from 1975 to 1990, Cafferty emphasized 
        affirmative action hiring practices, increasing diversity among the faculty.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Along with these efforts to make Bowdoin a more dynamic place, Cafferty 
        has helped the German department maintain its close, family-like relationship 
        with students. As part of a small department that graduates only 10-15 
        student majors a year, Cafferty gets to know her students very well, and 
        takes advantage of smaller class sizes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        She speaks of both the German language and culture with contagious enthusiasm: 
        &quot;German is fun!&quot; she declares. In addition, she relishes the 
        connections with art, music, philosophy, and history that German can facilitate. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Cafferty began studying German as an undergraduate student at Bowling 
        Green State University and in the early sixties studied away in postwar 
        Germany. While in the West German city of Freiburg, not even the Cuban 
        Missile Crisis could curb her enthusiasm and immersion in the language 
        and culture. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a senior, she began to consider graduate school, and earned her Masters 
        from Syracuse University, where she also served as a TA and discovered 
        her interest in teaching. After studying for her Ph.D. at the University 
        of Michigan, she was drawn to Bowdoin by the prospect of learning more 
        about a smaller, private liberal arts education. Starting as an Instructor, 
        Cafferty has become to the first woman faculty member to rise through 
        the ranks to full professor. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Thirty years after her arrival in Brunswick, Cafferty has not lost touch 
        with her many experiences, especially her travels to Germany both before 
        and after unification. She constantly draws upon the richness of her experience 
        and research to create new courses and enhance existing ones. Never one 
        to stop learning and exploring, Cafferty remembers the first time she 
        heard about graduate school: &quot;I didn't know what it was, but I knew 
        I wanted to do it. If after four years of college you feel you're just 
        starting to scratch the surface, you know the education has taken.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        One suspects that the more Helen Cafferty scratches, the thicker the surface 
        becomes.</p>
