      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">As many of you know, a group of students who are members 
        of the Bowdoin Coalition Against the War in Iraq recently collected signatures 
        from over 920 Bowdoin students in support of a resolution against preemptive 
        military action in Iraq. We brought the resolution to the Bowdoin Student 
        Government this past Tuesday, hoping that BSG would recognize that a majority 
        of Bowdoin students signed their names in support of the resolution and 
        that BSG would represent their constituents by passing the resolution 
        on behalf of the majority of the student body. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To our disappointment, the BSG as a whole voted against the resolution, 
        with 14 voting against and 11 in favor. We appreciate and thank those 
        members of the BSG who did their best to represent the majority of their 
        constituents and voted for the resolution.</p>
      <p align="left">
        One option open to us after Tuesday night was to call for a referendum 
        vote on the resolution, which would mean holding an on-line vote next 
        week on the resolution. Our initial response was to accept this option 
        and begin collecting signatures to call for a resolution. After much consideration, 
        the Bowdoin Coalition Against the War has decided, instead, to resubmit 
        our resolution to the Bowdoin Student Government. Given the simple truth 
        that a majority of Bowdoin students have signed the petition, there is 
        no doubt that such a referendum would pass. </p>
      <p align="left">
        We have chosen not to take this course for two reasons. First, such a 
        resolution would set a dangerous precedent. According to the constitution 
        of BSG, such a referendum requires only 250 signatures to be put on the 
        docket, at which time it would be voted upon by the entirety of the student 
        body. In this vote, only 25% must participate in order to make it valid 
        and the majority wins. In the worst case scenario, this means that a majority 
        consisting of 12.6% of the student body could pass a referendum in the 
        name of the majority of the Bowdoin students. In short, the greatest of 
        ills may be passed in the name of the student body if a well organized 
        12.6% of the school is able to prevail. This is a system not tenable with 
        the ideals of democracy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Second, and most importantly, such a referendum effectively disenfranchises 
        those 924 students who have already singed the resolution. In choosing 
        to vote the resolution down this past Tuesday, a majority of the BSG members 
        said that they simply did not care about the opinions of their constituents. 
        This injustice should not, and will not go by unchallenged. </p>
      <p align="left"> We believe that returning the issue to BSG and asking them 
        to fulfill their democratically elected duty to their constituents is 
        the best course of action. In the coming days, we will continue to collect 
        signatures from students who have not yet signed and would like to. The 
        signatures are on display in the student union; we encourage you to take 
        a look at this strong show of support for the resolution. We plan to bring 
        the resolution back to the BSG this coming Tuesday, and we hope that by 
        this time the BSG, as a democratically elected body, will recognize its 
        responsibility to represent the majority of Bowdoin students by passing 
        the resolution.</p>
