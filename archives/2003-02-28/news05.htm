      <p align="left">The Posse Plus Retreat, which took place last weekend at 
        the Portland Sheraton Hotel, brought together about fifty Posse and non-Posse 
        students, faculty and staff in a discussion forum of issues ultimately 
        relating to the Bowdoin campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Over the past few years, Bowdoin has placed more of an emphasis in promoting 
        diversity on campus. One of the primary venues for success in this field 
        has been with the Posse Foundation over the past three years. Bowdoin's 
        most recent efforts have placed it at the top among New England private 
        schools and their involvement with Posse.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Posse Foundation, according to its website (possefoundation.org), 
        &quot;identifies, recruits and selects student leaders from public high 
        schools to form multicultural teams called 'posses.'&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In many attempts by universities and colleges, such as Bowdoin, to diversify 
        their campus along racial, ethnic, cultural and class lines, retention 
        of those students became a major issue. Many minority students felt isolated 
        and out of place when they attended colleges and universities with limited 
        diversity. The Posse Foundation aims to provide those missing support 
        networks for the students it selects to better ensure that they will remain 
        at the college or university they are currently attending. It also aims 
        to &quot;serve as a catalyst for increased individual and community development&#133;from 
        diverse backgrounds to develop consensus solutions to complex social problems,&quot; 
        according to its website. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The retreat is a catalyst for dialogue,&quot; Gloria Lopez, Director 
        of Posse Boston said. &quot;We discuss lots of issues and the retreat 
        allows for a more open discussion of those topics.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Paul Min '03 thought &quot;the retreat provided an environment where people 
        feel comfortable to talk about issues when normally they skirt around 
        the issue.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Some of the matters discussed in the retreat's workshops began on a global 
        scale with screen images of racism, war, and poverty aimed at provoking 
        smaller group discussions about complex social issues. As the retreat 
        progressed, similar issues were brought into context, specifically for 
        the Bowdoin community and how different students feel they are treated 
        because of their race, class, gender, religion or sexuality. Posse's emphasis 
        in these workshops is twofold: global concerns are connected to campus 
        issues and dialogue is essential in addressing such topics. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As Richie Hoang '06 of Posse III points out, &quot;Things in the world 
        affect Bowdoin, such as poverty, racism and war.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        One workshop, in particular, focused on how particular ethnic, social 
        or gender groups are treated within the Bowdoin community. A small group 
        of Asian American students sat in the middle of the room, deeply engaged 
        in a conversation, while the rest of the retreat members served as the 
        audience, listening attentively to catch a glimpse of how some Asian Americans 
        feel on Bowdoin's campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        One student mentioned the need for an Asian American professor on campus, 
        not only to serve as an academic but also for mentoring purposes for Asian 
        American students. Another student felt intimidated with so few other 
        Asian Americans on campus and resorted to staying within a familiar group 
        of friends. Yet another talked about how the dining hall setup really 
        illustrates how students often gather into familiar groups with students 
        of color sitting in one place and white students sitting elsewhere. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Andria Ramkissoon '05, a member of Posse II, says that the retreat provides 
        a unique opportunity for a diverse group of Bowdoin students to engage 
        in important dialogue. &quot;We talk about issues that would not normally 
        be talked about on campus.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Posse, however, hopes to expand the dialogue on issues of race, gender, 
        sexuality, and other topics to the rest of the Bowdoin campus, so they 
        are not exclusive discussions to the members of the Posse Plus retreat. 
        With dialogue, challenging social matters can be addressed and effectively 
        discussed on campus, but only time will tell if the retreat continues 
        these important discussions on a more campus-wide scale. </p>
