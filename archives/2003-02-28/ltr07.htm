      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">Democracy&#133;democracy&#133;d-e-m---oh, here it is, in 
        Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary: &quot;1 a: government by the people; 
        esp: rule of the majority.&quot; Heavens! How simple! Had I only known, 
        standing there at this week's Student Government meeting, I would have 
        marched myself right up to the president of the BSG himself and whispered 
        it in his ear. Or held up a sign in clear block lettering. Or submitted 
        my dictionary in a ziplock bag as evidence, exhibit A. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But wait&#133; now that I think of it&#133;I did know the definition of 
        democracy at that meeting. Indeed&#133;who doesn't know the meaning of 
        democracy? The answer apparently-woefully, regretfully- is the Bowdoin 
        Student Government. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Now, angry reader-reader who is appalled by such accusatory language: 
        please quell your outrage, and I will respond to the criticisms of this 
        observation (one that is not intended to hurt feelings, but rather to 
        promote healthy and much-needed change within the administrative facilities 
        of this school) in the order in which they were received. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Question 1) The question, Ms. Ramey, is not about whether or not the people 
        of this campus know and understand the meaning of the word democracy. 
        Rather it is a simple matter of defining the jurisdiction of the Student 
        Government, taking into consideration what it has been, but moreover what 
        it should be. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Answer 1) An excellent point, thank you for bringing it up. What is the 
        role of our Student Government? Based on precedent, the members of BSG 
        are the guardians of this school's most cherished items and issues, namely: 
        T-shirts, washing machines and shuttle service. And as the refusal to 
        adopt this week's resolution illustrated very clearly, the BSG does not 
        see itself as the appropriate arena for political debate. </p>
      <p align="left">
        But let me pose a few questions of my own: by insulating the government 
        from all politics, thusly taking away a student's right to be fully represented 
        in their government, do we not create a system that fosters, nay, promotes 
        apathy? How can a government choose what and what not to represent from 
        the student body? </p>
      <p align="left">
        This week the majority of the student population presented itself to the 
        student government and was roundly rejected&#133;is this not indicative 
        of an ill-functioning democracy? Of indifference settled in the very marrow 
        of our administrative structure? </p>
      <p align="left">
        And, and is that choice to not address this issue also a political statement 
        of it's own? Is it not true that were we to remain silent on this issue, 
        that that silence would NOT be out of a commitment to non-partisan values, 
        but instead a deeply motivated (while quiet and manipulative) maneuver 
        to exercise the wants and needs of those opposed to the resolution? Indeed, 
        if we do not pass the resolution, we shuffle along, lemming-like, with 
        the rest of our country in deferent support of preemptive action. And 
        this is not an unhappy accident. There is no such thing as non-partisanship 
        in times like these, and so I would ask that those highly partisaned folk 
        check that misleading, stealthy and strategic language of impartiality 
        at the door.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Q2) Wait, but isn't it dangerous to politicize the student government? 
        What if student government suddenly passed a resolution in support of 
        a Pro-Life stance? What then, Sarah?</p>
      <p align="left">
        A2) In such a situation, the bottom line is that my outrage, no matter 
        how great, would not allow me to change the rules of democracy simply 
        to suit my own needs. No matter what the specifics of the political agenda, 
        a democratic government carries a very serious responsibility to represent 
        and speak for, unapologetically, the majority of the student body. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Q2) But why not just let it all go to a referendum?</p>
      <p align="left">
        A2) The answer is two-fold: a) the majority has already spoken and been 
        accounted for via the petition, therefore deserving the recognition of 
        the student government. However there is dispute surrounding the legitimacy 
        of said petition and thus the call for referendum, but the problem is 
        this: b) a referendum, while cloaked in &quot;officialness&quot; is actually 
        subject to comparable pitfalls that the petition was criticized for. We 
        already have signatures of the majority&#133;a referendum is not so foolproof 
        as to guarantee a more 'representative' count. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Q3) OK, but what say you to the obvious problem that this adoption, on 
        which we put the entire college's name, does not in any way represent 
        the entire college? </p>
      <p align="left">
        A3) I'll be brief. Put simply, in familiar language: this is what democracy 
        looks like. The hard fact of democracy, as stated before, is that the 
        majority does rule. Democracy does not boast of making decisions 100% 
        amenable to its representatives. Is this perfect? Of course not&#133;but 
        that is how democracy works. It is ridiculous to suddenly pull out a bunch 
        of Quaker/consensus rhetoric in the middle of a democratic process. That's 
        what we call cheating. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Additionally, the Resolution, in its wording, does not claim that it represents 
        the moods and motivations of every single student at Bowdoin college. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Q4) But Sarah, I feel alienated.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A4) Well, sorry. Welcome to being a minority. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Q5) So maybe you're right. But, tell me, do you really believe any of 
        this petitioning will have a real effect on the outcome of this war?</p>
      <p align="left">
        A5) Excellent point. Why do anything at all? What else have we learned 
        at this school, as exemplified perfectly by our student government, but 
        to turn away from challenges when those challenges loom large? We stand 
        at a moment in history where we can either stand up and speak for ourselves 
        or sit on our thumbs and let a wave of quietly partisaned apathy wash 
        over us. There are two choices. There is no middle ground. Regardless 
        of the imagined effects or lack thereof in signing a resolution against 
        preemptive strike in Iraq, we must choose. Not choosing is choosing. Either 
        take a stand or step aside, but in the event of a horror that none of 
        us can begin to imagine here in quiet New England, you must know, know, 
        that you stepped aside. </p>
