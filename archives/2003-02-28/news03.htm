        <font size="2">EVRON LEGALL<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The crux of the problem that troubles John Perry Barlow, 
        a former Grateful Dead lyricist, and Co-Founder and Vice-Chairman of the 
        Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the relationship between big business 
        and the U.S. government. Barlow, last week's Common Hour speaker, expounded 
        on these and other issues relating to civil rights and internet privacy 
        last Friday in Pickard Theater. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Barlow started by pointing out that since the fall of communism and the 
        triumph of laissez-faire capitalism, there has evolved an environment 
        in which large corporations are for the most part unregulated. This, Barlow 
        said, was a result of a breakdown in the regulatory role of the government. 
        This ultimately resulted in the state actually beginning to act as a servant 
        of large corporations-and he quoted from Mussolini to back up his point: 
        &quot;Fascism should rightly be called corporatism, as it is the merge 
        of state and corporate power.&quot; He also said that although this wasn't 
        an entirely new phenomenon, that &quot;it is only in the past few years 
        that the United States military has become the security force for the 
        Fortune 500 and is out there making the world safe, not for democracy, 
        but for Shell and Exxon.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        He said that while corporations differed from people &quot;as much as 
        an anthill differed from an ant,&quot; that these organizations acted 
        exactly as if they were large organisms, that like human beings, sought 
        to survive by &quot;bringing in more nutrition to itself.&quot; Nevertheless, 
        he took great care to say that he was &quot;not completely disabused&quot; 
        of the notion that corporations were basically good entities run by fairly 
        honest people. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Barlow then raised the issue of corporate control of information saying, 
        &quot;&#133;there is another movement afoot, which I think is a very important 
        movement, to own the human mind&#133;institutionally.&quot; He said that 
        private companies are scared of the possibilities of the digital environment, 
        particularly as it pertains to its ability to reproduce intellectual property 
        at almost zero cost. They thus seek to extract the maximum return from 
        each and every use of their goods. He then continued to comment on why 
        these corporations react to what they see as an attack on their bottom-line 
        the only way possible in a digital environment- by eliminating shared 
        use. They seek to do this by tagging every bit of information that they 
        sell, to keep track of its usage and whereabouts according to Barlow.</p>
      <p align="left">
        He went on further as he said, that they were now &quot;enclosing much 
        of what has in Wonderland digital book aloud to your children would be 
        a copyright been in the public domain into their own digital wrappers&quot; 
        so much so that you would fear that reading an Alice infringement. He 
        gave the example of a Russian programmer, Dmytri Sklyarov-coming from 
        a country where information was required by law to be as free as possible-who 
        figured out a way to extract electronic books from their digital wrappers 
        and was arrested on a visit to Las Vegas for infringement of the Digital 
        Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). &quot;Interestingly enough,&quot; he 
        said &quot;the former Soviet Union wants to make information free, while 
        the United States of America is trying to imprison information.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        He further revealed that there were movements by the content industry-through 
        a bill introduced by Congressman Howard Berman-to obtain for themselves 
        the right to search an individual's hard drive for forbidden content, 
        such as those exchanged in peer-to-peer services like Kazaa. Also sought 
        is the power to then shut down parts of the internet with which that person 
        may have any interactions, through denial of service attacks. &quot;They 
        are asking for the right and the ability to close down any part of the 
        internet that is behaving in a way that they don't like,&quot; he said. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        He expressed view that the internet was the last frontier for information 
        and hoped that it would be able to hold out against what he sees as certain 
        destruction by these unscrupulous companies.</p>
