        <font size="2">JAMES BAUMBERGER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I'll admit that the pro-war argument had me convinced. 
        I drifted like many Americans into a blind approval of the imminent war 
        with Iraq.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I blame this mostly on myself for accepting Bush's rhetoric at face value. 
        However, I save some blame for the lack of American discourse on any alternatives 
        to armed combat. The Democrats, the media, and even Colin Powell seem 
        resigned to (if not eager for) war.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As I stop to think of the broader policy questions, I am more than bit 
        scared of the implications of an Iraqi war. At the heart of the plans 
        for Iraq is a monumental shift in foreign policy. The new doctrine of 
        the Bush administration would permit preemptive military action against 
        a perceived enemy based on the mere assumption of future aggression. It 
        may seem harmless until one considers a world in which preemption is the 
        dominant military philosophy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Saddam is crazy, but he isn't stupid. One has to give him credit for knowing 
        that if he ever used weapons of mass destruction against Americans, his 
        reign, and probably his life, would be over in a matter of days. But under 
        the Bush ideology, where possibility trumps probability, such an argument 
        can be brushed aside.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Why is it that the case against Iraq, and by proxy the case for Bush's 
        new doctrine, is so persuasive? Fear, I guess. We've been scared ever 
        since 9/11, and rightfully so to a certain degree. Our president tells 
        us to worry about Saddam, and we do. Rather than focusing on the American 
        youth who won't come back from Iraq alive, we watch Homeland Security 
        ads that do more to scare than to comfort and then we run out to buy duct 
        tape.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The more I thought about this policy, the more I began to question whether 
        it was right for America. And if not, what was?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Enter a recent episode of NBC's The West Wing* that I mistakenly thought 
        would offer a better model for American policy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the midst of preparing for his second inaugural address, President 
        Bartlett was faced with an emerging crisis in Africa. A &quot;civil war&quot; 
        in the fictional nation of Equatorial Kundu was quickly becoming a one-sided 
        ethnic slaughter of thousands.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With American inaction weighing heavily on the president's mind, he rhetorically 
        asked, &quot;Why is a Kundunese life worth less to me than an American 
        life?&quot; A staffer responded, &quot;I don't know, sir, but it is.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The staffer's quip instigated a round of presidential soul-searching that 
        culminated in a decision to introduce a new foreign policy doctrine in 
        the upcoming speech.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We're for freedom of speech, everywhere. We're for freedom to worship, 
        everywhere&#133; freedom from tyranny, everywhere.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        American values, everywhere.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It's foreign policy with purely humanitarian motives and our military 
        strength to back it up. It's &quot;liberalism with a grenade launcher.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The theory is that if the world was free, even if by force, we'd all be 
        safer from terrorism.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Would we be better off if humanitarian interests provided the impetus 
        behind our military policy? It is possible this new direction would help 
        repair the diplomatic rift caused by a global sense of America's self-centeredness. 
        It might, however, only serve to shift world perceptions of our egotism 
        from that of protecting our homeland and economic security at all costs 
        to that of forcing our morality upon the globe's &quot;backward&quot; 
        people.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, Bartlett's proposal offers us no better solution in our 
        quest for a sound strategy. Sending our army around the world to raise 
        our flag in the name of American values is tantamount to renewed imperialism.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But it sounds so good, doesn't it?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Regrettably, we live in a world that has more oppression than we could 
        possibly eliminate. More to the point, what little we could accomplish 
        might result in serious consequences.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Let's take Saudi Arabia for example, both the world's largest oil exporter 
        and a perfect example of the tyranny. The kingdom is a repressive and 
        despotic monarchy with little freedom of expression and few rights for 
        women. Yet, we can't exactly send bombs flying into Riyadh without risking 
        global economic depression if things don't go well.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But what about those dying Kundunese? Unfortunately, The West Wing* writer 
        Aaron Sorkin couldn't have picked a less controversial illustration of 
        the Bartlett Doctrine the mass murder in Kundu. Rarely do we have the 
        luxury of such moral straightforwardness as we do in cases of genocide. 
        The president's ultimate military intervention in Kundu was a relative 
        no-brainer.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The real world would be less black and white. The well-intentioned but 
        hugely unrealistic Bartlett plan offers little hope.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Where both the Bartlett and Bush doctrines fail is not so much in their 
        objectives, but in their methods. The values are not at issue. We certainly 
        have a right to defend ourselves against foreign enemies, and there is 
        nothing wrong with actively promoting American liberty (just so long as 
        it's not at gunpoint, save in instances like Kundu).</p>
      <p align="left">
        The problem then must have less to do with the actual policy objectives 
        and more to do with how we accomplish them.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Excessive militarism would have a devastating impact on global stability. 
        Instead we should secure our nation and spread American values with a 
        diplomatic strategy that emphasizes morality and multilateralism.</p>
      <p align="left">
        America is the world's only dominant military, economic, and diplomatic 
        power. Therefore, we shouldn't underestimate our ability to affect change 
        without the use of laser-guided bombs and special ops forces.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If we adopt a softer diplomacy based on both morality and international 
        security, we will gain the world respect, and leverage, necessary to push 
        our objectives in a peaceful way. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And if we are successful in sponsoring freedom in the world, maybe countries 
        like Iraq will be a thing of the past.</p>
