        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In 1970, students gathered at Bowdoin to protest the Vietnam 
        War. The May 6, 1970 Bowdoin Orient* outlines the reasons that students 
        decided to strike: &quot;students and faculty were incensed at the invasion 
        of Cambodia &#133; and at the killing of four Kent State University students.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        On Tuesday night, a coalition of Bowdoin students presented a petition 
        to the Bowdoin Student Government opposing President Bush's decision to 
        seek preemptive war in Iraq. After a thorough and civil debate, BSG voted 
        14 to11 not to approve the petition on the question of war with Iraq. 
        To have accepted the petition could have set a dangerous precedent in 
        that it would overly politicize the BSG election process. Though activism 
        is commendable, it is prudent for BSG to represent a new approach to issues 
        surrounding war from that which our parents used. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Supporters of the resolution argued that Bowdoin Student Government is 
        constitutionally permitted to take stances on political matters of national 
        or international concern. I am not a scholar of the BSG constitution, 
        so I cannot textually speak to the issue. However, though both sides have 
        legitimate arguments, it is best that BSG not take stances on national 
        issues and it remains non-partisan. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Resolution supporters suggest that being a member of BSG is a leadership 
        position that requires one to take a stance on national issues. This is 
        an understandable perspective. Many people who seek to run for BSG may 
        see it as a precursor to higher political office. However, I think this 
        presupposition is incomplete. As a member of BSG said at the meeting, 
        he ran for BSG so that he could correct problems on the campus: bring 
        about late night dining, make laundry machines &quot;ID card accessible,&quot; 
        bring back the Portland-Freeport shuttle, etc. He did not run to express 
        his opinion on national political matters. More importantly, neither did 
        his constituents elect him, nor likely any other member of BSG, because 
        of his opinion on a particular national issue. </p>
      <p align="left">
        BSG candidates do not distribute brochures explaining their opinions on 
        abortion, taxes, foreign policy, etc. as do candidates for local or national 
        legislative offices. They fail to &quot;pamphleteer&quot; because until 
        this week, it was presumed that BSG would not address issues of national 
        political importance. As some BSG members themselves discussed at Tuesday's 
        meeting, BSG is a non-partisan body. I believe this &quot;non-partisan&quot; 
        condition is important because it helps attract committed and unpretentious 
        people to the body. </p>
      <p align="left">
        BSG has no power over national policy on issues such as abortion, taxes, 
        and foreign policy. In addition, as a BSG member said, is it fair to expect 
        first-years, or anyone really, to campaign through their dorms and have 
        to explain their political opinions to everyone he or she encounters? 
        There is a reason many people do not like discussing political matters. 
        They are inherently contentious and, especially when personal relations 
        are still embryonic, these issues can hinder if not shatter developing 
        friendships. BSG usually only deals with local matters, thus to turn the 
        campaign into a debate on national and international issues would defeat 
        the purpose of BSG and likely prevent qualified individuals, who are not 
        preoccupied with national matters, from applying. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Just as students did thirty years ago, Bowdoin students came together 
        to discuss their opinions on a war. It is a testament to our engagement 
        in national issues that we came together actively and courteously. Activism 
        is not defeated because our student government decided to force the resolution 
        supporters to bring it to the campus as a referendum. This decision enhances 
        people's opportunities to educate themselves about the issue while also 
        respecting limits on BSG purview and its non-partisan status. Our campus 
        is indeed more restrained than our parents' was. However, today's war 
        is different and the issues surrounding it are different. It commands 
        a new approach for a new era. </p>
