        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The men's squash team finished its season at nationals last 
        weekend as the fifteenth best team in America, beating Navy 6-3 in the 
        final round of the Hoehn, B-level Division.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After narrow 5-4 losses to Amherst and Denison in the preliminary rounds 
        of the tournament, the Bowdoin men returned to defeat Navy 6-3 in the 
        finals. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The fact that the team came back to beat Navy is a big accomplishment, 
        especially since we lost to them the past two years,&quot; said coach 
        Tomas Fortson.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Finishing off the season with a win against Navy was excellent,&quot; 
        agreed senior co-captain George Hubbard. &quot;It's been awhile since 
        we've beat them, so I was excited with our level of play and the results. 
        It was a real mental victory for the team to pull a tough match out after 
        two disappointing losses.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although Bowdoin's top three players-juniors Greg Clement and Lawrence 
        Delasotta, and sophomore Jon Crowell-lost their matches, first-years Doug 
        Weeden and Bruce Saltzman, sophomores Eric Toan and Chris Metcalf, junior 
        Grant White, and Hubbard all won their matches in the fourth through ninth 
        positions, respectively.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Saltzman played very well in winning his three matches [against 
        Amherst, Denison, and Navy], including the clincher versus Navy,&quot; 
        said Fortson. &quot;White also went undefeated, as did Hubbard. Weeden 
        won two out of three matches, including a big win versus Amherst.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Clement, Saltzman, and junior Mike Fensterstock joined Weeden to win their 
        matches over Amherst in the first round of the tournament last Friday; 
        however, Bowdoin lost 5-4 overall in an extremely close team match against 
        the Lord Jeffs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;A few of [the] matches went into five games and should have been 
        taken by us easily!&quot; said Saltzman. &quot;But when it came down to 
        the end, we lost by only a few points. We know that we could have and 
        should have beaten Amherst.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        After Amherst, the men continued on to play Denison, against whom they 
        again suffered a tight 5-4 loss. Saltzman, Metcalf, White, and Hubbard 
        all beat their Denison opponents. &quot;We had beaten Denison 8-1 earlier 
        in the season, but we couldn't capitalize this go-round,&quot; said Hubbard.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Throughout the year, we lost more than our share of 5-4 matches,&quot; 
        said Fortson. &quot;Hopefully we will learn from those defeats and take 
        the steps to the next level.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Our team results are not reflective of our potential,&quot; said 
        Saltzman. &quot;We worked extremely hard this season, and it is a shame 
        that we couldn't have proven so in the nationals, but we know we will 
        be back next year ready to win.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Fortson said that &quot;the B Division was very evenly matched, and we 
        had the level of play to win it. I think we will learn from the experience 
        and challenge again for the B trophy next year. We may have had our best 
        chance ever to win, [but] at the same time, other teams also improved 
        enough to have the six through eight teams in position to win that division.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;This season was bittersweet, where we had the most skill and potential 
        that the Bowdoin squash team has ever seen, but [we] had a tough time 
        achieving our potential during matches,&quot; said Hubbard.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ending their team season with an 8-10 overall record, the men send Clement, 
        their top player, to the Individual National Championships at Trinity 
        this weekend. Currently ranked the forty-sixth best player nationwide, 
        Clement will represent the Bowdoin Men's Squash Team against some tough 
        competition.</p>
