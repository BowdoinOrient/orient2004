      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p align="left">Now, I strongly believe that caveats are for little children 
        (Mommy's gonna be back soon, okay?). There will be none here. The following 
        article is for people who think. Take it however you like it. I am not, 
        however, responsible for your conclusions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        So, whose grand idea was it to ask Haliday Douglas to argue the opposition 
        viewpoint at the Bowdoin Student Government meeting on Tuesday? From the 
        outset it was obvious that he didn't believe a word of what he was spouting. 
        He didn't even pretend to believe it. Now, in order to improve the chances 
        of this article being published, I will restrict myself to saying that 
        his efforts could best be described as &quot;disconnected&quot; - no two 
        words were in any way connected. Uh huh&#133;Tuesday night was about as 
        intensely partisan as I have ever seen the Bowdoin campus get. The Bowdoin 
        Student Government gathered to consider whether or not to endorse the 
        petition against the war on Iraq as the majority opinion of the school 
        body. The mood in the room was great, and most of the arguments solid&#133;most. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The argument in favor of endorsing the resolution was simply that because 
        a large number of students signed the petition- some 900 odd - the BSG 
        was obligated to recognize the deep feelings of the majority by voting 
        to endorse it. The punch line for this viewpoint seemed to be the performance 
        by the women's a Capella group Miscellania. They basically sang a song 
        about some hypothetical war widow who lost her husband (I presume) in 
        Vietnam and was so distraught, that she basically told the government 
        exactly where to put the money they were sending her each month. I must 
        confess that I suddenly had visions of Woodstock '67 (Come on! You know 
        I was there!) Hey, war is bad&#133;not so? Well, whatever -- that wasn't 
        even the point.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The opposing argument went like this: according to its own constitution, 
        the BSG was established to represent students as far as it pertained to 
        school affairs, and that it was out-of-place for the association to be 
        taking sides on political matters-especially since it also has an obligation 
        to represent as many students as possible. That job would be much easier 
        if it avoids politics like the plague. I agree.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I'll tell you what else was out-of-place. The fact emerged several people 
        didn't know at the time of signing the petition that this would become 
        a BSG issue. All this time, Mr. Douglas' fake shell was flaking off like 
        a bad case of dandruff. Then he said it. To peals of laughter, he made 
        a remark that called their literacy into question, implying that the information 
        was on the petition for all to read. No it wasn't-- certainly not in the 
        version of the petition that I read. You see, Mr. Douglas, most people 
        simply cannot read something that isn't there. They just can't. Can you 
        show us how?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally, the representatives in support of the motion, after trumpeting 
        the grand significance of the 900 signatures then promptly proceeded to 
        undermine their own argument by opposing a student referendum-claiming 
        that the same students who were so overwhelmingly passionate about the 
        war that they were moved to sign a petition would somehow suddenly become 
        too apathetic to find a browser, type webmail.bowdoin.edu and type &quot;Y-E-S&quot; 
        in an e-mail. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After all the gymnastics with words, I remain clueless as to the usefulness 
        of a BSG stamp on the anti-war petition. If the BSG wants to continue 
        to be regarded as a non-partisan organization, it needs to run far, far 
        away from the Iraq resolution and other resolutions like it. Thank goodness 
        they did. </p>
      <p align="left"> The BSG put the issue back into the hands of the students- 
        and that's exactly where such partisan stuff belongs.</p>
