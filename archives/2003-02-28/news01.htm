      <p align="left">After a lenghty forum in Moulton's Lancaster Lounge, the 
        Bowdoin Student Government refused to endorse the resolution offered by 
        the Bowdoin Coalition Against the War in Iraq (BCAWI). The group requested 
        support for their resolution condeming preemptive military action against 
        Iraq. The gathering was a circus of passionate energy and diverse beliefs, 
        engaging an unprecedented amount of students overflowing with a political 
        fervor that does not typically grace the Bowdoin campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The BCAWI requested that the BSG endorse the 924 signatures they collected 
        on their petition, on grounds that the resolution represented a majority 
        of the campus and that the BSG should follow their duty of representing 
        them. Prior to this meeting, Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley said, 
        &quot;I'm not sure why the petition organizers are seeking the endorsement 
        of student government per se, I think 1000 signatures sent to the Maine 
        Congressional Delegation from 1000 Bowdoin signatories would be a powerful 
        political statement in its own right.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Student government was confronted with the issue when, according to BSG 
        President Jason Hafler '04, &quot;Matt Fleck '03 and other students emailed 
        BSG saying, 'We have this petition going around and we want the Bowdoin 
        student government to endorse this,' We said, 'Hey, okay, interesting, 
        let's think about this. Is it the student government's place on campus 
        to do it?&quot; Prior to the gathering, when asked about his views on 
        the issue, Hafler said, &quot;I personally don't know if it is student 
        government's place. If it is the majority of the students do we represent 
        them, well yes. But do we represent their political views? I don't know, 
        it is kind of a touchy subject.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The forum began with public participation, moved to a presentation by 
        individual BSG members of the pros and cons of accepting the resolution, 
        and then evolved into a general debate between the members of the student 
        government. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Every corner of the room was filled and the participants in Lancaster 
        were ready to stay true to their viewpoints and initiate a heated exchange. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Before the BSG started their debate, members of the BCAWI presented the 
        signatures claiming they represented a clear majority of the student body 
        and thus warranted representation by the BSG, a democratically-elected 
        body. The BCAWI made clear that their resolution was not pro-Saddam Hussein 
        or anti-military, but rather about anti-preemptive military action. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Coalition members hoped to further strengthen their case by noting that 
        over 50 other schools have already supported similar resolutions including 
        Bates and Colby.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Anyone wanting to address their opinions on the matter had the opprotunity 
        to do so. Speakers included conservatives and liberals, members of Miscellania, 
        and many others who felt their concerns needed to be voiced. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Those in favor of the resolution argued that it was the duty of BSG to 
        represent and stand behind the voice of those who signed the petition, 
        despite the fact that they might personally disagree, as they are obligated 
        to represent the majority and the number of signatures represented a majority-56 
        percent-of the campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Supporting this side of the argument, Eric Abrams '03 said, &quot;This 
        is a campus issue. You don't normally get people like this in your meetings. 
        Nine hundred and twenty is a huge majority of those on campus.&quot; He 
        continued, &quot;Young people don't often get heard in Washington, so 
        any school voicing its opinion is important and can be heard in a louder 
        way. It is your responsibility to get our voices heard. Forget technicalities 
        and the charter-and people not expecting this to come up when they voted 
        for you-it is clear how people feel.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Those opposing the resolution argued that they had voted for their BSG 
        members on the condition that they were to deal with campus issues, not 
        world or political ones. Jason Long '05, representing this side, said 
        to the BSG, &quot;You are democratically elected, but you are elected 
        in the context of Bowdoin College policy and student life. My vote would 
        be different if I knew that you would be making political decisions in 
        my opinion. This petition is reflective of student opinion-but not a valid 
        place for BSG intervention.&quot; Pat Donahue '04, shared Long's opinion, 
        but for different reasons. Donahue believes that Bowdoin taking a strong 
        stance on a political issue in the name of the majority will further suppress 
        and alienate the view of the minority and this will be detrimental to 
        the College's goals of diversity. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After hearing student input, BSG members began discussing the matter. 
        Pat Burns '03 and Alison George '03 spoke on behalf of the resolution 
        while Haliday Douglas '05 and Dan Schuberth '06 spoke in opposition. Their 
        points mirrored those made earlier by the students. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In arguing for the resolution, Burns said, &quot;Due to the number of 
        signatures, we cannot just turn our back. Minority views exist in every 
        vote-it is inevitable. It is very hard to get a complete consensus on 
        an issue and this should not stop us from acting.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Schuberth, opposing, claimed that prior to the debate he sent out a campus-wide 
        email asking for student feedback on the act of the resolution coming 
        before the BSG. He received 300 responses, 100 of which were students 
        worried about the stance being brought to the student government. Douglas 
        and Schuberth questioned whether or not the resolution was within the 
        role of the BSG and they feared that passing the resolution would create 
        an unfriendly environment for the minority groups. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The floor then opened to all members for debate. Conflicting views immediately 
        arose among the group. Dan Hayes '05 said, &quot;I signed up to make Superfan 
        t-shirts, shuttle kids to hockey games, or what not. Can you imagine first-years 
        running having to give their political opinions?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        A general consensus among government members could not be reached and 
        some members proposed a referendum, which according to Vice-President 
        for Student Government Affairs Ed MacKenzie '03 is, &quot;A direct student 
        vote on the resolution [where] all students would be eligible to vote 
        online, just like class officer elections, and the question would be whether 
        or not students approved of the resolution. A majority of those voting 
        is necessary for passage, provided that at least 25 percent of the student 
        body votes. If less than 25 percent of the student body votes, the referendum 
        is invalid.&quot; A referendum can be initiated with a two-thirds vote 
        of the senators or by 250 student signatures. Tejus Ajmera '04 thought 
        that a referendum would be the best way to settle the matter since it 
        would give students a chance to think twice about the Schuberth issue. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Agreeing with Ajmera, was Alexis Bawden '04 who said, &quot;We should 
        have a referendum. We need to represent the entire student body. By putting 
        it out to the people, we give the voice to them-not just keeping it within 
        ourselves.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Some felt that the petition might not be accurate and pointed to a referendum 
        as a chance to eradicate any doubt. Government members in favor of a referedum 
        said that the petition may have been flawed in that not all students knew 
        that BSG endorsement would be sought.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The motion for referendum failed and BSG moved on to the question of whether 
        it would recognize the petition itself. The forum ended when BSG refused 
        to recognize the petition by a close 14 to 11 vote, leaving mixed feelings 
        among the crowd.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Some BSG members were disappointed with the outcome. George said, &quot;I 
        am deeply disheartened by the decision of the Bowdoin Student Government. 
        While I truly respect all opinions that were presented, it is clear that 
        the final outcome drastically undercuts the relevance of BSG to student 
        life. We may have reduced ourselves to a poster-making, t-shirt producing, 
        polar-point-advocating body with little to say on issues that the student 
        body truly finds compelling.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Not disheartened by the outcome of Tuesday night's meeting, BCAWI members 
        Wednesday afternoon began to collect the necessary 250 signature to force 
        a referendum on the issue. If a valid referendum does take place, under 
        the Constitution the outcome is binding and would have the same force 
        as a resolution adopted by the BSG. </p>
