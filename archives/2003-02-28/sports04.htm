      <p align="left">The drama has begun-the Bowdoin Women's Hockey Team finished 
        its regular season as the only undefeated team in college hockey, regardless 
        of division for both men and women. An overtime tie against Middlebury 
        and a close 3-2 victory over rival Williams preserved its undefeated status. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Contrary to last week's report, the win over Williams gives Coach Michele 
        Amidon her 100th win and places her as one of only three coaches in Division 
        III who have reached the century mark. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the heart-stopping match-up against hated rival Middlebury, the Polar 
        Bears were seeking revenge for a 1-1 tie that took place in Vermont earlier 
        this season. Despite holding a 2-1 advantage until the final 30 seconds 
        of the game, Bowdoin allowed the tying goal, forcing what resulted in 
        a scoreless five-minute overtime. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Controversy abounds, however, as the net was off its posts during the 
        moments surrounding the final goal. Alas, the officials neglected to make 
        the call and breathed new life into the Panthers. Despite this non-call, 
        the Polar Bears emerged unscathed with their undefeated record intact.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Big-time players show up for big-time games. With the near capacity crowd 
        flooding Dayton Arena, all of Bowdoin's big guns leapt at the chance to 
        show off their stuff. In the second period, senior Ba Lanoue put on a 
        clinic scoring an unassisted goal that pulled the Bears to a 1-1 tie. 
        About five minutes later, Shelly Chessie '03 proved that she was not to 
        be outshined. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After a scuffle in front of the Panther net, Chessie flipped a miracle 
        shot into the goal, giving Bowdoin their 2-1 advantage. Appropriately, 
        top-scoring defenseman Kirsti Anderson '05 and three-time NESCAC Player 
        of the Week Marissa O'Neil '05 collected assists on the play. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Middlebury, ranked fourth nationally, put up 28 shots against second-ranked 
        Bowdoin. However, goaltender Emily McKissock '03 continually robbed the 
        Panthers and subsequently finished the night with 26 saves. In the final 
        moments of overtime, the talented Middlebury goaltender denied golden 
        opportunities for O'Neil and Cathie Quinlan '05. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Of the tie, O'Neil said, &quot;I feel that we are stronger and have more 
        depth than Middlebury, but we kind of psych ourselves out because it's 
        always one of our biggest games, and we come out too nervous in the first 
        period.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Quinlan added, &quot;The Middlebury tie was disappointing, but it gives 
        us something to be hungry for, to work for. The win is something we all 
        want so bad that the tie just motivates us to work harder.&quot; From 
        here on out, the Bears will have to win to assure the continuance of their 
        season. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Against Williams College the next day, Bowdoin held on to a 3-2 lead through 
        the very end, asserting its dominance over the rest of the NESCAC competitors. 
        Finding themselves down 1-0 after the first period, the Polar Bears answered 
        with a pair of power play goals to take a 2-1 lead. Gill &quot;Spirit 
        Fingers&quot; McDonald '04 notched the tying goal with assists from O'Neil 
        and Anderson. Beth Muir '03 slammed the second one home on another Anderson 
        assist. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the third frame, Lanoue snatched the puck at mid-ice and skated at 
        lightening speed toward the Ephs' goalie, scoring the shorthanded breakaway 
        goal with seeming ease and textbook form. McKissock ended the contest 
        with 16 saves preserving the win for the Bears.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Said Quinlan, &quot;The thing I regret the most about our season is our 
        first tie to [number one ranked] Elmira. It keeps me in good spirits, 
        however, that we were only three games into our season, and were missing 
        the players who went abroad. I feel much more confident now and look forward 
        to meeting them again.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        O'Neil echoed the same confidence, saying, &quot; I'm very happy with 
        the position that we are going in to postseason with, except that a win 
        versus Middlebury would have been big.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Concerning practice, the mini-game saga continues. When asked about the 
        rumors of McDonald and Sadie Wieschhoff '04 cheating, O'Neil simply said, 
        &quot;They aren't rumors.&quot; O'Neil also noted, &quot;Frankie is so 
        far the mini-game MVP&quot;. The winner of this much-coveted title will 
        be revealed later.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In lighter matters, Chessie, acting as a Residential Life Staff member, 
        organized a figure skating competition that featured acts including team 
        members Francesca Klucevsek-Whalen '03, Leah McClure '05, Quinlan, Wieschhoff, 
        McDonald, Rebecca Selden '06, and Alyson Lizotte '03. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The event allowed the participants to express the more artistic aspects 
        of their talents and certainly provided priceless entertainment for the 
        significant crowd that ventured out to catch them. Quinlan said, &quot;Like 
        the mini-games, it's good to have a little competition on our team. Everyone 
        was awesome, but I have to hand it to 'Spirit Fingers'-the way McDonald 
        tossed Wieschhoff into the air like she was some kind of blow up doll 
        was unbelievable.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        O'Neil remarked, &quot;Gill stole the show-Sadie could have worked on 
        her skating skills, Leah and Cathie had a very skillful techno performance, 
        and all the others were great.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The hard work has paid off thus far for the team, and the grind of playoff 
        play is beginning. It is always tough to balance sport and academics, 
        but as the Bears gear up for midterms, their efforts must be re-doubled 
        on the ice to keep their dreams of a National Championship alive. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Quinlan said, &quot;The team is in a great position going into playoffs. 
        We are all having a great time and playing well. We improve every game 
        and hopefully that will continue throughout.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        So when you see those Bears trotting from class to practice with frantic 
        looks on their faces, take a second to shout out &quot;Hey, good luck!&quot;, 
        &quot;Keep up the good work!&quot;, or maybe &quot;Beat everyone so I 
        can talk trash to friends at other NESCAC schools!&quot;</p>
