      <p align="left"> &quot;When I graduated from high school,&quot; recounts 
        Carrie, &quot;I actually remember people telling me that when I got to 
        college I should say I had a boyfriend from home, whether I did or not. 
        Then, as soon as I found a guy I actually liked, I should 'break up' with 
        my imaginary boyfriend so that the new guy and I could get together and 
        live happily ever after. But as sick as it sounds, when I got to Bowdoin, 
        I thought that maybe I should have listened-it seemed as though everyone 
        got here with a boyfriend or girlfriend from home!&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        While I certainly do not condone the advice given to Carrie, I do agree 
        with her assessment that a large proportion of Bowdoin students are involved 
        with non-Polar Bears. That is why this week I am examining LONG DISTANCE 
        RELATIONSHIPS IN COLLEGE.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Chip and Ann have been together for years. As in, since eighth grade. 
        When they talk about being married one day they are being completely serious-both 
        of them. As far as they are concerned, the four years they have to drive 
        five or six hours every other weekend are a tiny percentage of the lifetime 
        they are going to spend together. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ramona, on the other hand, tells the story of Nat, a guy who was hitting 
        on her last weekend. &quot;Don't you have a girlfriend?&quot; she asked 
        him. &quot;Yeah, but I promise I'll break up with her really soon,&quot; 
        he replied. And he wasn't joking. Nat and his girlfriend are a perfect 
        example of a couple that should not be in a long distance relationship. 
        No matter how in love they once were, if one of them could even think 
        of breaking it off that easily then they are casualties of the miles that 
        separate them. And as extreme as the case Ramona cites is, similar things 
        occur all the time.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Long distance relationships are very hard to maintain. When you don't 
        see someone every day, or even every week, you may begin to forget why 
        you were so in love with them in the first place. This is not always the 
        case, but when it becomes more of a chore or habit than a pleasure to 
        call your boyfriend, you should begin to think about whether or not it 
        is worth it. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Relationships where the couple is in the same place at the same time make 
        sense for many reasons. First of all, they have things in common, things 
        to talk about and jokes to share that have not been re-hashed every day 
        over email since Christmas, when they last saw each other. The relationship 
        can grow and change as both of the people do, rather than remaining stagnant 
        and holding them back. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I am in no way recommending that make yourself miserable by breaking up 
        with someone you really care about. I address this article to the guy 
        who has been apart from his girlfriend longer than he has been with her 
        and doesn't really know why they are together at all, except that she 
        still calls him every night to complain about how much work she has. It 
        is to the girl who secretly tells herself that if that guy in her anthro 
        class asks her out, she will break up with her boyfriend at Harvard, but 
        until then she really likes saying she has a boyfriend so she won't bother.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Even more so, I address the person who drives to visit their significant 
        other every weekend to the point that they are depressed when they are 
        at school because they just wish they were with them and not here. These 
        are the people who need to re-prioritize.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Eve explains that she and Charlie were really in love when they got to 
        college. &quot;We were making ourselves so upset by being so far away 
        that it ended up not being worth it. We broke up, which I think was the 
        right thing to do. If we are meant to be together, we can get back together 
        after college. But we would really have regretted it if we had ended up 
        ruining our college experiences by stressing about this whole long distance 
        thing. I have dated other people here, and if anything, they have made 
        me more experienced and now I can appreciate what Charlie and I did have.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        You would not break up with someone because you had to spend a weekend 
        apart. Likewise, a semester abroad is a small percentage of a three-year 
        college relationship and does not merit ending a relationship. But to 
        spend four years apart of a relationship that will ultimately last for 
        a total of 5 or 6 does not really seem to be worth it, especially when 
        those four years could be happy ones. Wouldn't you rather enjoy your college 
        experience?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Look, I am not saying long distance relationships are bad; in fact, some 
        of the healthiest and happiest couples I know do not both go to the same 
        school. But there are many people who are holding themselves back by using 
        the &quot;I have a boyfriend or girlfriend from home&quot; excuse rather 
        than putting themselves out there. I am very against relationships for 
        convenience's sake. I am even more against people making themselves miserable 
        and preventing themselves from enjoying college because they can only 
        think about someone who is miles away and who they could break up with 
        next week, thereby having wasted the best years of their lives&#133;or 
        just a few months of college&#133;either way, there's a lot of fun out 
        there to be had and if you feel like you are missing out, you probably 
        are. </p>
