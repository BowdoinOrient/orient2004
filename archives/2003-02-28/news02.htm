      <p align="left">The Student Organizations Oversight Committee (SOOC) met 
        with the editors of <i>Ritalin</i>, Bowdoin's humor publication, on Wednesday 
        to discuss numerous complaints regarding the paper's content. The magazine's 
        most recent issue sparked controversy over what appeared to many as homophobia 
        and misogyny, with the terms &quot;faggot&quot; and &quot;f--king whore&quot; 
        provoking the most complaints. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The meeting between the SOOC and Ritalin founders/Editors-in-Chief Jay 
        Kang '02 and Eric Goldwyn '03 lasted an hour before the committee briefly 
        discussed the issue among themselves. Afterwards, the committee proceeded 
        to vote 6-0 to require that the publication obtain a faculty advisor. 
        The committee also voted 5-1 in favor of limiting the publication to 12 
        pages instead of 16. The SOOC officially informed Ritalin of their decision 
        last night at 10 p.m. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We voted to limit space to encourage concise and selective quality 
        control, and for an active advisor to attend to editing,&quot; said chair 
        of the SOOC Haliday Douglas '05. &quot;Their charter was not revoked, 
        though Ritalin must report to the committee that they do in fact have 
        a faculty sponsor before they receive funding for their final two publications.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        In response to the vote, Goldwyn said, &quot;This is clearly illogical 
        censorship. There was no precedent to rely on to give us this bizarre 
        editing process. Jay and I put over 100 hours into each issue, expecting 
        people to read [the publication] as a joke. Some people have just read 
        too closely.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ritalin's charter began last spring and the magazine has published three 
        times since the fall, with a circulation of 800 copies per issue. Emphasizing 
        how each issue receives wide readership after circulation, Goldwyn said, 
        &quot;A majority of students enjoy Ritalin. The SOOC responded to the 
        issue unilaterally, without seeking to get a sense of Bowdoin's overall 
        opinion, beyond the individual complaints. That's unprofessional.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The magazine has been criticized for its willingness to direct its critical 
        humor narrowly at individuals and groups within Bowdoin. For some students, 
        however, this should be considered a boon to the campus. &quot;I support 
        it because it's a risqu&eacute; publication and provides an alternative 
        media to the mainstream Orient,&quot; said Sam Kapelle '05. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Student Activities Fee Committee (SAFC) member Sue Kim '05 said, &quot;In 
        the beginning I thought it was a good publication on campus. The last 
        issue really disappointed me because it's not enriching life on campus 
        or promoting tolerance within the community.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley has been assisting the committee 
        in sorting through the controversy. &quot;The question is whether the 
        publishers of Ritalin are using the funds that were allocated to them 
        by the SAFC in a manner consistent whether their mission statement. The 
        degree that people think it is in bad taste is not in and of itself grounds 
        to pull their funding completely.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Goldwyn further said, &quot;I don't think the process and makeup of the 
        committee is fair. The committee harped over a few isolated words assuming 
        everything in the magazine is offensive. We wondered if they had even 
        read through its entirety.&quot; Goldwyn also commented on Douglas and 
        Kang's &quot;history of not getting along.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Douglas felt that the committee went about the situation in an appropriate 
        manner after they, as well as the Dean's office, received numerous individual 
        phone calls from students and faculty concerning the publication's offensive 
        content. &quot;We respond to concerns in the community and look out for 
        the health of student activities on campus. We used constitutional prerogative 
        to determine whether the publication is truly healthy for the campus. 
        Ritalin was found to have mildly violated the constitution, making them 
        subject to be sanctioned.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Douglas described the meeting itself as &quot;running smoothly as both 
        editors were polite and there was a nice tempo in the room.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the other hand, Goldwyn said, &quot;Nothing new was really discussed 
        since we had exchanged several emails and talked face to face about the 
        issue to Douglas beforehand. We felt like everything was already decided.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The publication has expressed interest in appealing to the Bowdoin Student 
        Government (BSG). Ritalin can appeal the SOOC decision in the next seven 
        days in which case 13 of the 26 members of the BSG (seven of whom are 
        SOOC members) would have to vote to overrule the decision. Rejection of 
        an appeal would only require six more BSG members, beyond the seven SOOC 
        members, to vote in favor to reject the appeal. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Goldwyn spoke of petitioning for a referendum if an appeal is defeated, 
        and possibly entertaining some fundraising activities as well. &quot;We 
        would like to raise enough money for the normal 16 page format and maybe 
        longer for our last issue, since we're both graduating and write almost 
        all of the material between the two of us,&quot; said Goldwyn. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though the editors &quot;wouldn't see it as a torch being passed on,&quot; 
        they are open to passing on the publication to Bowdoin students after 
        they graduate this spring. </p>
