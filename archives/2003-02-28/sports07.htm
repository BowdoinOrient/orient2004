        <font size="2">J.P. BOX</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Vince Lombardi once said, &quot;Winning isn't everything, 
        it is the only thing.&quot; The greatest coach in NFL history is wrong-dead 
        wrong. Mental, physical, and emotional sacrifice has always accompanied 
        athletics in the United States. Only today, that sacrifice can lead to 
        death.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Welcome to the life story of Baltimore Orioles' pitcher Steve Bechler. 
        After a late-season promotion to the big leagues last summer, Bechler 
        busted his butt to get ready for the 2003 Major League Baseball season. 
        His low-90s heater moved, and his curve ball had some serious bite.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After spending the better part of the past three years in the purgatory 
        of Minor League ball, the 23-year-old Bechler was determined to stay in 
        the Bigs. However, his bulky frame betrayed his desire to be a conditioned 
        player capable of pitching late into a game. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To compensate, he turned to ephedra, a substance that causes weight loss 
        and energy gain. If this story sounds too good to be true, it is. Bechler 
        died of a heatstroke on February 17, just a few days after reporting for 
        Spring Training. Although ephedra has not been officially cited as the 
        cause of death, evidence suggests that the drug played a key role.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The NFL, NCAA, and IOC (International Olympic Committee) have all banned 
        the use of ephedra for health concerns. The Food and Drug Administration 
        reports ephedra use is responsible for 88 deaths and over 1500 health 
        problems, including strokes. Tack one more person to that total-a Major 
        League baseball pitcher's dream landed him in a mortuary.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But come on! How could Bechler have been that stupid? Clear evidence proves 
        the substance's volatility. I mean, how did he ever get his hands on this 
        deadly drug? Surely this stuff isn't just sitting on the shelf at your 
        local GNC! Actually, it is.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But if you don't want to hop in your car, surf the internet and you'll 
        find great deals in no time. At bizrate.com, I found 77 different ephedra 
        products that I could have shipped by tomorrow. My favorite is Black Cross' 
        &quot;Pure Ephedrene&quot; - for only $11.99, you get 60 pills. The recommended 
        dose is one tablet every four hours. How often do you have to take this 
        crap!?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps until it kills you-Bechler is nonliving proof of that. In a sport 
        where batters are finding an edge in steroid use, it is only natural that 
        a pitcher would turn to an artificial enhancer. In the end, this crazed 
        competition didn't improve the quality of life for anybody-it took it 
        away.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, Steve Bechler's tragic tale is not an isolated incident; 
        rather, it is indicative of sports competition entering the twenty-first 
        century. The price of success has become prohibitively expensive, pushing 
        amateur and professional athletes to the brink and beyond.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Just last fall, Korey Stringer-the Pro-Bowl offensive tackle of the Minnesota 
        Vikings-collapsed and died of a heatstroke during Training Camp. Weighing 
        in at approximately 335 pounds, Stringer was hell-bent on shedding pounds 
        and proving his durability to teammates.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After vomiting three times during the warming practice, Stringer stumbled 
        into the air-conditioned training room where he collapsed and died. Doctors 
        discovered that his body temperature had risen to 108.8 degrees Fahrenheit. 
        Like Bechler, Stringer was known to use ephedrene supplements.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Do you think that professionals are the only ones dying from over-exertion? 
        Think again. According to a study conducted by the University of North 
        Carolina, 18 high school and college athletes have died from heart-related 
        complications since 1995. With the widespread sale of dieting supplements, 
        that number will only increase in the foreseeable future. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After all, ephedra products garnered $1.24 billion in 2001 for 80 companies. 
        That kind of sales total indicates the drug's widespread popularity in 
        the amateur and professional ranks. In the United States, billion-dollar 
        industries don't disappear overnight.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, one drug cannot be blamed for turning sports into a game of roulette. 
        Rather, the competitive drive and the obsession with winning push coaches 
        as well as athletes to neglect health concerns. Heck, playing with pain 
        is just part of the game. Short-term rewards are willingly substituted 
        for long-term health-even when the athlete hasn't reached high school.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A 1997 Globe study revealed that 33 percent of athletes under 15 years 
        of age played through serious injuries. Additionally, according to a 1996 
        U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission report, more than 201,000 youth 
        basketball players required hospitalization due to injury. Football, baseball, 
        and soccer tallies came in at 167,000, 147,000 and 69,000 respectively. 
        Is this the price of competition?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Growing up, you may have thought that sports were a matter of life and 
        death, but your parents and coaches assured you that they were not. Steve 
        Bechler, Korey Stringer, and a host of others beg to differ. </p>
