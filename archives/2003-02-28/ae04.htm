      <p align="left">Le Tigre: 5 stars out of five</p>
      <p>Punk music depends on balance. At one end is the testosterone-chord crunching 
        of speed metal bands interested mostly in inspiring violence at their 
        shows, giving very little though to musical originality. And at the other 
        end are bands like Green Day and Blink 182 whose dabblings in pop music 
        strip them of the screw-the-world mentality that is essential to punk 
        success. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In between these two extremes exists a middle ground where reckless charm 
        and raw emotion can be paired with innovative, expressive music. The Clash 
        did it. So did the Minutemen and so did Rancid. Unfortunately, since Rancid's 
        And Out Come Wolves, punk rock has patiently sat through a long line of 
        mostly Southern California knock-offs of these seminal bands.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While current punk bands like Pennywise, MXPX and the Misfits can all 
        inspire massive mosh pits at their concerts, none of them has pushed the 
        bar musically and suffer from rather short shelf-lives as a result. How 
        many times can we hear MXPX cover poppy songs from the soundtrack of Grease 
        before we start looking for something fresh? How many times can the in-your-face 
        lyrics of the Misfits overcome the fact that they play the same five chords 
        using the same guitars for all of their songs? </p>
      <p align="left">
        To be fair, the balance between music and image is often a difficult task, 
        especially given the excess-driven nature of punk rock where every new 
        band must compete to be &quot;harder&quot; than the last. This sort of 
        dick-measuring should be called for what it is: typical male behavior, 
        and so it's not surprising that the latest important album put out in 
        punk came from a group of girls hailing from a lesbian-run label called 
        Mr. Lady. Although they most likely would balk at any attempt to classify 
        their music, the three women of Le Tigre embody the basic fundamentals 
        of punk rock. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Their songs are obnoxiously political and anti-authority. They have stupid 
        opinions about everything. They scream a lot. They wear trend-setting 
        clothes, but tell interviewers that they wear them to bed after a night 
        of hard drinking. </p>
      <p align="left">
        They thrust their crotches on stage. If this was all that Le Tigre did, 
        they'd still be the closest thing to the Dead Kennedys around. Which is 
        good enough. What Le Tigre does that sets them apart from even the Dead 
        Kennedys is that they pair punk charisma with a toolbox of new sounds 
        and beats that allows them more musical options than a similarly minded 
        band like Sleater-Kinney who relies more on the traditional guitars and 
        drum kits. </p>
      <p align="left">
        What results is a flashy, fast-driven and highly original sound that meshes 
        well and sometimes overshadows the band's lyrics, which run the full range 
        from smart and provocative (Deceptacon, My My Metrocard) to horribly stupid 
        (Get Off the Internet, Bang! Bang!) Hot Topic, for example, is an intensely 
        stupid song that only involves lead singer Kathleen Hanna reading through 
        a list of feminists and rock girls. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The lyrics (&quot;Aretha Franklin! Joan Jett! Ariel Skragg! Vaginal Cream 
        Davis!&quot;) are about as interesting as listening to Harlan Pepper name 
        every type of nut in Best in Show, but just like in Harlan's case, the 
        delivery-a perfectly timed swinging beat and a catchy melody-makes the 
        list entertaining. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Thank god, most of Le Tigre's songs are not dumb as Hot Topic and although 
        the educated listener will scoff at some of their political excesses, 
        being over-the-top is what you're supposed to do as a punk rocker.</p>
      <p>Herbal essences: 4 stars</p>
      <p>I had a little extra Christmas money, so I bought a bottle of Herbal 
        Essences Natural VOLUME! Shampoo instead of the usual White Rain. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I was happy with my purchase because upgrading the products you use makes 
        you feel like you're moving on up in the world. Earlier that month, I 
        stopped buying the Shaw's brand of Creamed Corn and stepped up to Green 
        Giant. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Some people believe that you grow by doing these things-they won't admit 
        it but that's what they think. Middle age is a vodka martini for these 
        people and old age is a fat Mercedes S-Class.I bought the shampoo mostly 
        because my hair was flat and White Rain made my eyes burn. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Having flat hair is okay if you've got a sharp, angular face like the 
        guy from the Strokes, but I happen to have a head shaped like a pumpkin. 
        Limp, flat hair on a pumpkin accents roundness. Linus from Peanuts is 
        a good example of this phenomenon. So is Billy Corgan from back in the 
        Siamese Dream days. I wanted hair like Schroeder and I thought that the 
        three extra dollars I was investing into botanical volume building shampoo 
        would get me the full-bodied head of hair I so wanted. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Well, it worked until this afternoon when I ran out of shampoo. Now my 
        hair is flat and looks weird and I hate it. I read in a men's magazine 
        about these pills that permanently give your penis a little bit more body. 
        Is there any hair product that achieves similar full-bodied results? </p>
      <p align="left">
        If so, it will receive 5 stars and Herbal Essences Botanical Shampoo-Natural 
        VOLUME! will be downgraded to three stars. You always have to compare 
        things against the competition. </p>
