      <p align="left">In 1999, the Delta Sigma fraternity had just sold its house 
        to the college. However, the legacy of creative college participation 
        and willingness to think outside of the box-politically and artistically-was 
        not sold along with the property. Instead, members of the fraternity were 
        determined to keep the legacy of Delta Sigma alive.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Burgie Howard, Director of Smith Union and Student Activities, played 
        an instrumental part in organizing the use of the Delta Sigma fund. The 
        determination to support &quot;interests of Bowdoin student life&quot; 
        and &quot;artistic sensibility&quot; culminated in the birth of an art 
        competition. &quot;The first year,&quot; said Howard, &quot;we displayed 
        the show at the newly created craft center&quot; but &quot;it quickly 
        became obvious that we would outgrow that space, as interest was very 
        high.&quot; The display was soon moved to Smith Union in the Lamarche 
        Lounge where it has been for the last three years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This year, there have been 59 submissions and the judges have been coordinated 
        by Peter Simmons '78, a representative from the Delta Sigma Alumni corporation 
        and the Executive Director of the Bowdoin Summer Music Festival.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Simmons was able to provide some background information concerning the 
        Delta Sigma fraternity. Traditionally, the fraternity represented some 
        of the most liberal tendencies on the Bowdoin College campus. In 1946, 
        &quot;the local chapter accepted its first African American member and 
        on prohibition from the national organization the fraternity defiantly 
        accepted additional African-American members.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ultimately, said Simmons, these defiant motions resulted in the fraternity's 
        expulsion from the national organization in 1954. Furthermore, said Simmons, 
        &quot;when women were admitted to Bowdoin in 1970, Delta Sigma welcomed 
        them, allowing them full membership and voting privileges from the outset.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Delta Sigma's history of openness was reflected in its support of artistic 
        endeavor and notoriety. For example, Delta Sigma was &quot;best known 
        for its dance hall&#133;.the murals that covered most of the wall space 
        inside the house, and an eclectic mix of non-traditional students and 
        activities.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In step with the colorful tradition that DS had established, the houseestablished 
        an activities fund and a scholarship fund in memory of the DS organization.&quot; 
        The idea behind this fund, said Simmons, is to &quot;preserve some of 
        the intellectual diversity and the dynamic artistic environment that existed 
        at Delta Sigma.&quot; Presently, the organization acts as &quot;a separate 
        legal entity to participate in the administration of the Activities Fund.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The art contest, which continues in the vein of the Delta Sigma legacy, 
        is &quot;the most exciting use we have made of the activities fund&quot; 
        said Simmons. The competition is open to all Bowdoin College students 
        and cash awards are given to as many as five participants. In the egalitarian 
        spirit of Delta Sigma, however, there is no grand prize. Furthermore, 
        due to the wealth of creativity that is displayed, &quot;the jury usually 
        has difficulty confining it to five awards.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;For my part,&quot; Howard commented, &quot;it is really one of the 
        neatest programs we are able to pull together each year. The competition 
        allows people to see another side of their classmates and friends. The 
        DS/DU competition provides the campus with a wonderful opportunity to 
        see this work, and give it the recognition it deserves.&quot; For the 
        lucky few, a cash prize reinforces the fact that they are making art an 
        intimate friend and contributing to our collective common good. </p>
