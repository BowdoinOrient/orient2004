      <p align="left"> There comes a time in a person's life when she just needs 
        to laugh-laugh long, laugh hard, and laugh uproariously. The time, my 
        fellow filmgoers, is now.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I usually skip dumb comedies because most of them are, well, dumb. But 
        Old School was a cut above the rest: it was original. Reminiscent of the 
        good old days of Ace Ventura, There's Something About Mary, and Austin 
        Powers, the humor in this film-not to mention the comedic talent of the 
        actors-makes it not only good for a feature-length laugh, but also just 
        plain good.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Just ask the half of Baxter House or the mix of Brunswick High students 
        that packed the house. They'll agree with me. Heck, even the elderly couple 
        in the back enjoyed it; I heard their cackling loud and clear. This is 
        not just a guy movie, nor is it just a college movie. It's funny for everyone-even 
        stingy wanna-be critics.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The plot is sort of like a mix between Animal House and Fight Club. It's 
        about going crazy at college, but it's equally about three adult guys 
        breaking society's rules and having some fun.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mitch (Luke Wilson) is a burned-out office worker whose sex-driven girlfriend 
        just dumped him for a couple of gang bangers. Bernard (Vince Vaughn) is 
        a wealthy father of two and owner of Speaker City in six locations. And 
        Frank (Will Farrell), well, Frank's kind of a na&iuml;ve loser who tried 
        growing up too fast by getting married.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But the three friends soon find a way to make it all a bit more exciting. 
        When Mitch buys himself a new house, close to the nearby Harrison University, 
        the guys decide to turn it into a non-exclusive fraternity, initiating 
        pledges of all ages and professions, and throwing legendary parties that 
        earn Mitch the title of &quot;The Godfather,&quot; revered and respected 
        around town. But the nerd, as always, wants his revenge; Dean Prichard 
        (Jeremy Piven), once these guys' high school punching bag, wants the fraternity 
        kicked out. He bribes, he schemes, he cheats; but in the end, of course, 
        he loses, and Lambda Epsilon Omega lives on.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It gave me a sweet kind of feeling to see that little Luke Wilson is growing 
        up. Finally, this square-jawed hunk of a man (yeah, I said it) is in a 
        significant leading role, coming out from under the shadow of his older 
        and more famous brother, Owen. Of course, Luke was not exactly made for 
        physical comedy-not in the slightest-so he stays relatively tempered as 
        Mitch, the everyman. He's the guy with the good intentions, the guy we 
        can all relate to. We cheer him on as he tries to balance his job with 
        the fraternity and win the affection of the pure, sunny little damsel 
        Nicole (Ellen Pompeo), whose current boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) is 
        clearly and conveniently a big fat jerk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Then there's Vince Vaughn. The man was marvelous. He had some of the film's 
        most potent and clever lines. He is the cynical bastard of sorts who always 
        seems to get what he wants, though he's never happy. All he has to say 
        is &quot;earmuffs&quot; and his two kids obediently cup their hands over 
        their ears, giving all present the freedom to say what's really on their 
        minds. Bernard may be the most disturbing character; isn't he worried 
        about his wife? His kids? His business? He's got the ideal life, so how 
        does he explain being in a fraternity? But no, Bernard has no shame.</p>
      <p align="left">
        What to say about Will Farrell? This film is none other than his big break. 
        You walk out of this movie feeling about Will something very similar to 
        what you felt about good old Jim Carrey while walking out of the first 
        Ace Ventura: damn-this guy's got it. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Frank is clearly intended as the recipient of all the punches, jokes, 
        and the most unfortunate circumstances: having a tranquilizer shot into 
        his jugular, being lit on fire in a mascot costume, streaking by himself 
        down a main street in the town, getting beat up by Andy Dick, just to 
        name a few. Almost every moment he is on screen he is inspiring laughter. 
        Just look at him. He's a goofy guy even when he's not making jokes. Will 
        Farrell is the single greatest thing about this movie.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I expect to see quotes from this film appearing in numerous AIM profiles 
        and away messages very soon. I also expect to see the film play over and 
        over again at college dorms and high school sleepovers before the year 
        is out. And I expect Will Farrell to rise out of the comedic dump of Saturday 
        Night Live and finally make it big in film. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you're not in the mood for the long four-hour haul of Gods and Generals 
        or the oozy sentimentality of The Life of David Gale, then by all means 
        revert to Old School.</p>
      <p align="left">
        You've worked hard, people. You deserve it.</p>
