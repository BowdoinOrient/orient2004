        abortion<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left"> The fight to defend so-called &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; 
        was destined to be lost eventually.</p>
      <p align="left">Despite a massive effort by abortion rights groups to stop 
        it, the bill banning this procedure is almost certain to receive the final 
        approval of the Senate and the presidential signature needed for it to 
        become law.</p>
      <p>While these groups were trying to avoid the catastrophe they saw as the 
        beginning of the end of abortion in America, the way they fought it could 
        ultimately do a disservice to the cause of protecting a woman's right 
        to choose.</p>
      <p>For clarity's sake, &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; isn't a medical 
        term, but a political one. It's one of those contrived terms intended 
        to make something sound horrible. It's sort of akin to the Republicans' 
        changing the name of the estate tax to &quot;the death tax.&quot; The 
        correct term for the most commonly used method of late-term abortion is 
        &quot;intact dilation and extraction,&quot; or D&amp;X.</p>
      <p>The bill currently in Congress would ban what is referred to as &quot;partial-birth 
        abortion&quot; except in cases where the mother's life is in danger.</p>
      <p>D&amp;X is typically performed in the third trimester although it is 
        at times performed in the second trimester. It involves delivering much 
        of the fetus's body from the womb, extracting its brain from the cranium, 
        and removing the rest of its body from the mother.</p>
      <p>This description can make even the strong a bit squeamish. It is gruesome 
        by anyone's standards. I say this not to argue against the procedure, 
        but instead to show why many pro-choice supporters oppose the use of D&amp;X.</p>
      <p>Aside from the question of whether or not D&amp;X should be legal in 
        principle, there is a still a question regarding the effectiveness of 
        the pro-choice movement's political strategy.</p>
      <p>Ever since the partial-birth abortion ban entered the national dialogue 
        in the mid-1990s, the pro-choice groups have fiercely lobbied against 
        its passage.</p>
      <p>By fighting so aggressively, they have made partial-birth abortion the 
        most visible abortion rights issue on the agenda. </p>
      <p>This was not the smartest idea. A vast majority of Americans, in most 
        polls around 70 percent, oppose partial-birth abortion. To add to that, 
        in recent years more Americans have identified themselves as pro-life 
        rather than as pro-choice, which was not the case several years ago.</p>
      <p>In a time when Americans are becoming less sympathetic to the pro-choice 
        cause, picking a high-profile fight over such an unpopular issue is only 
        going to drive more people away from supporting for reproductive rights.</p>
      <p>Abortion advocates make the case that banning partial-birth abortion 
        would only be the first of many provisions on the slippery slope towards 
        restrictive abortion laws. The irony is that by vehemently opposing the 
        partial-birth abortion ban, the pro-choicers may be hurting the very agenda 
        they are trying to protect.</p>
      <p>A better strategy would have been to concede the loss of partial-birth 
        abortion, especially with a Republican Congress and a pro-life president. 
        Energies would have been better spent entrenching in a more widely accepted 
        agenda that would avoid splitting abortion's supporters, energizing the 
        pro-life forces, and driving the average partial-birth-abortion-opposing 
        American farther away from the pro-choice camp.</p>
      <p>More focus should be placed on tearing down barriers to abortion early 
        in the pregnancy. This can be accomplished in several ways, including 
        improving the access of rural women to abortion clinics, educating women 
        about their reproductive rights, and making emergency contraception more 
        widely available. The goal should be creating less need for late term 
        abortions.</p>
      <p>Interest groups can run into trouble balancing idealism with politics. 
        The pro-choice groups may be tempted to follow their principles on every 
        issue, but the mere fact that these powerful groups hold tremendous sway 
        over lawmakers makes them inherently political organizations. They need 
        to embrace this political power and use it to their long-term advantage.</p>
      <p>A more modest and politically savvy agenda will ensure that when the 
        real debate comes around (the nomination of anti-Roe v. Wade judges to 
        the Supreme Court), the pro-choice activists will have the support necessary 
        to prevail.<br>
