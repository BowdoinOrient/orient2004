        STAFF WRITER</font></p>

      <p align="left">Last year 4,719 high school seniors from across the country 
        submitted applications to Bowdoin College. Of the 1,154 who were accepted, 
        75 were &quot;recruited&quot; athletes. According to Jeff Ward, Director 
        of Athletics, &quot;A recruited athlete is somebody who could be successful 
        here academically, but their participation in athletics is something that 
        shows distinction.&quot; </p>
      <p>Interscholastic teams are made up of three types of athletes: recruited 
        athletes who were supported in the admissions process by a coach, recruited 
        athletes who were not supported in the admissions process by a coach, 
        and walk-ons or athletes who did not communicate with the coach before 
        they arrived at the college. The presence of recruited athletes at highly-selective 
        small colleges and Ivy League schools has been scrutinized for years. 
      </p>
      <p>In a recently published book, Reclaiming the Game: College Sports and 
        Educational Values, William G. Bowen looks at how recruited athletes are 
        admitted to NESCAC and Ivy League schools and how they perform once they 
        are accepted. &quot;Based on the class of '99, Bowen found that &quot;three-quarters 
        of recruited male athletes in high-profile sports (football, basketball, 
        and ice hockey) and nearly-two thirds of male athletes in lower profile 
        sports (soccer, track, swimming) are in the bottom third of their class 
        at the Ivies and at NESCAC colleges, far more than male walk-on athletes 
        or male students who do not play sports.&quot; </p>
      <p>The admissions office and the athletic office work hand-in-hand to try 
        to admit the smartest athletes they can. The NESCAC states in its Conference 
        Agreement: &quot;The program in intercollegiate athletics is to be kept 
        in harmony with the essential educational purposes of the institution.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Bowdoin has reaffirmed that athletics is an important part of our 
        educational environment and also reaffirmed that the student athletes 
        should be reflective of a student body as a whole,&quot; said President 
        Barry Mills. &quot;The Office of Admissions is always looking for appropriate 
        pieces to form a complete incoming first-year class and a complete student 
        body as a whole. This includes athletics, music, theater, and various 
        other factors like ethnic and socioeconomic diversity.&quot;</p>
      <p>Athletics is the only department, however, where the process of recruitment 
        must be specific with lists of athletes who coaches need to fill certain 
        positions on the team so that they are able to participate and compete 
        against other colleges in the NESCAC league. Musical conservatories have 
        similar lists of &quot;recruited musicians&quot; who are needed in these 
        institutions to fill certain spots in orchestras, bands, and choirs. </p>
      <p>&quot;It's true that we give credit to talented athletes in the admissions 
        process, but we also give credit to other talented people,&quot; said 
        Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley. </p>
      <p>Recruitment for every sport at Bowdoin is handled differently depending 
        on the coach. In general, the coach will tell admissions how many athletes 
        they will need in the next year to compete. After consulting with the 
        admissions department, each team has a certain number of athletes they 
        can deem &quot;recruits,&quot; totaling up to 75 for all the teams combined. 
      </p>
      <p>Recruiting for football is complicated because of the large size of the 
        team and the number of football players in New England who want to compete 
        at a small Division III school. There are many national and local companies 
        that will do preliminary scouting for college coaches to make the process 
        somewhat easier. These companies will put together a book of many of the 
        best high school football players in the country including the athlete's 
        GPA and class rank. </p>
      <p>Using this book, Coach Dave Caputi can send letters to all the football 
        players with a certain GPA and above. Aside from sending letters, Caputi 
        calls many high school coaches and talks to many athletes who initiate 
        the process themselves by calling or emailing him. Every athlete that 
        Caputi is seriously interested in is asked to send their transcript with 
        class rank and GPA and a tape of one of their football games. </p>
      <p>Using the information Caputi gathers from the tapes and talking to the 
        high school coaches, he is able to rank the football players from one 
        to five based solely on their athletic ability and football skills. Caputi 
        fills out a First Year Athletic Recruit Information Form for each athlete 
        under consideration and sends it to the Office of Admissions. The form 
        shows the athlete's academic qualifications and athletic abilities. Caputi 
        obviously has pre-screened these athletes first, and will not waste Admissions' 
        time with athletes he knows do not meet the school's academic standards 
        for admission.</p>
      <p>The Office of Admissions then sends a form back ranking the athlete's 
        academic qualifications and basically stating whether the athlete would 
        be accepted into the college without being added to the recruited list. 
        Those talented athletes who would get in without being added to the list, 
        continue to communicate with the coaches but carry on in the admissions 
        process as a regular applicant. Out of the remaining athletes, Caputi 
        cannot just take the smartest football players on his list; he must also 
        look at what positions need to be filled on the team. </p>
      <p>Head Hockey Coach Terry Meaghar, agrees that the recruiting process is 
        very complicated. </p>
      <p>&quot;You have to stray true to who you are. We are experts of what is 
        happening at Bowdoin, but we have no control of the outside. The NESCAC 
        and the NCAA make the standards that we follow. Sometimes you have to 
        trust your leadership,&quot; he says. </p>
      <p>Reclaiming the Game not only has statistics about recruited athletes' 
        performance once they get into college, but also cites statistics about 
        how impressive these athletes' admissions statistics are in comparison 
        to others. &quot;Recruited male athletes in high profile sports had SAT 
        scores between 119 and 165 points below their non-athlete peers at the 
        Ivies, the NESCAC colleges, and other coed liberal arts schools.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>In response to the admissions statistics, Director of Admissions Jim 
        Miller said, &quot;People are not one dimensional. It's not as formulaic 
        as people think it is.&quot; </p>
      <p>&quot;Athletes can't be tagged like trouts,&quot; said former Football 
        Coach Howard Vandersea. Vandersea and Caputi argue that many athletes 
        are involved in many other extracurricular activities that would affect 
        the amount of time they can spend on their schoolwork. Most Division III 
        athletes are not going to go on to play professional sports, but most 
        of them saw some value in continuing to play competitively. </p>
      <p>&quot;There are many different types of intelligences,&quot; Caputi said, 
        &quot;One can learn in the classroom, the playing field, the dorms, or 
        the choir room.&quot; </p>
      <p>The Admissions Office and the Athletic Department have done a lot to 
        address many of the concerns addressed in Reclaiming the Game. They have 
        tried to reduce the number of recruited athletes in each class. They are 
        also trying to further integrate the faculty into the athletic department. 
        The hockey team, for example, has a faculty liaison who is aware of the 
        team's schedules, workouts, and events. </p>
      <p>Although many are happy with the changes that are being made to address 
        this issue, others feel that it is unfair to single out the athletes. 
        &quot;It is so unfair for freshman football players to be put in that 
        category when they haven't even done anything,&quot; said football player 
        Jarrett Young '05.</p>
      <p>Nancy Jennings, an Education professor, agreed, &quot;My concern is what 
        happens to the individual kid. Once they're here they might be stereotyped. 
        They might feel that they are only here for one reason and as a result, 
        might not even feel that they can ask for help when they need it.&quot; 
        As a faculty member, Jennings finds it hard when a student is faced with 
        an overlap of an athletic and an academic commitment. </p>
      <p>Jennings, however, used to teach at a Division I school and definitely 
        sees a difference in the student body at a small school such as Bowdoin. 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The boundaries between athletics and academics at Division I schools 
        are much clearer,&quot; Jennings said. </p>
      <p>Michael Stevens '04, captain of the hockey team, is proud of his teammates 
        and points out that the team encourages each member to do well academically. 
        The Baldwin Center chose two tutors from the team to help out the other 
        players with any problems they might have. Stevens feels that his involvement 
        in hockey actually helps him manage his time and use it more efficiently. 
      </p>
      <p>Jeff Ward said that the coaches here are not just interested in athletics. 
        &quot;The coaches are amazing and are proud to sell the whole package 
        of Bowdoin. If we fail academically, we all feel like we've failed,&quot; 
        he said.<br>
