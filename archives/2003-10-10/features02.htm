      </table>&quot;The Eskimo has always had a constant fight for 
        survival against what would seem to be overwhelming difficulties-the long 
        dark winter, the eternal cold, and the never-ending search for food. The 
        only element which can provide sustenance is the sea.&quot; </i>
<p>The sustenance that the sea provided for the Inuit, who spread from Alaska 
        to Greenland along the rim of the Arctic Circle, came in the form of seals, 
        whales, and the ability to travel great distances over water. How did 
        these hunter-gatherers survive in the world's harshest environment? They 
        got good at sea kayaking.</p>
      <p>The Inuit boats were usually skin-on-frame, made with animal hides and 
        whatever driftwood or bone they could find to build them. Inuit could 
        travel incredible distances in their boats, and had amazing seamanship: 
        they could navigate by the stars, control their boats in foul weather, 
        and were able to roll them using their paddle, their knife, or just their 
        hands. This ability to roll was absolutely essential, because, when whale 
        hunting, Inuit and Greenlanders would often sew themselves into the boat 
        so that they wouldn't fall out and be immersed in the frigid water. Because 
        of the rarity of driftwood and supplies, their kayaks were their most 
        important possessions, passed from father to son with each new generation.</p>
      <p>Though boat design and materials have changed over the years, the reason 
        for paddling remains the same: to kill sea creatures. With that in mind, 
        I have taken the liberty of contacting the United Nations and applying 
        for a license to hunt gray whales from a small craft. That's right, all 
        of you that thought the Bowdoin Outing Club was a bunch of tofu-loving 
        hippies, you were wrong . Pending UN approval, the first-ever BOC whale-hunting 
        trip will be going out November 26th. It should be an incredible trip-mortality 
        rates are expected at around 50%, but if we succeed and survive, each 
        participant will be allowed to take home approximately 247 pounds of blubber, 
        suitable for turning into garments, making candles, and cooking delicious 
        blood soup. </p>
      <p>In the unlikely instance that the international embargo on whale hunting 
        is not lifted on account of my request, sea kayaking trips will still 
        go out the weekend that we return from fall break, and I encourage anyone 
        available to sign up. All joking aside, if you haven't been sea kayaking, 
        you are doing yourself a disservice-it is an amazing way to get to know 
        the ocean, see the coast from a whole new perspective, and reconnect with 
        a rich history of paddlers. People pay top dollar to paddle the Maine 
        coast each year, and BOC members have the opportunity to do it for free. 
        Don't miss your chance-trips will go out one more weekend this fall and 
        all spring.</p>
      <p>Also, don't forget to mark the date of October 27th on your calendars. 
        Alvah Simon, author of a book called, &quot;A Life Well Wasted&quot; is 
        going to be speaking at Bowdoin. He is a fantastic speaker, and his slides 
        are truly amazing. As a young man, Alvah decided that he didn't want to 
        join the working world, and was &quot;terrified with the prospects of 
        responsible adulthood.&quot; His quest to live life on his own terms has 
        led him around the world and back. You won't want to miss this presentation.</p>
      <p>Finally, I would like to conclude my column, once again, with helpful 
        advice for the wee lads and lassies of the class of 2007. This week, I 
        have heard many of you around campus complaining about how cold it is. 
        My advice: Get a Clue, Freshmen! Follow me close here: it's not cold yet. 
        Last winter, I woke up half-naked in a snow bank outside a campus-wide. 
        My hands were purple, and would very clearly need amputation. My beer 
        had frozen solid next to me. A squirrel was trying to chew through my 
        flesh to sleep in my still-warm abdominal cavity. Did I complain? No. 
        I got up. I put my shirt back on. And I went dancing! </p>
      <p>Oh sure, you laugh now, but pretty soon we're all going to be trudging 
        to class like the main character in &quot;To Build a Fire.&quot; And, 
        to be quite honest, some of you Floridians, Californians, or even Massachusetts-folk 
        are not going to make it. And we'll leave you there on the quad. OTSS-Only 
        The Strong Survive. It sounds harsh, but, as Lord Byron says, &quot;The 
        cold in clime are cold in blood.&quot; Remember that, and come on BOC 
        trips while you still can.<br>
