      <p align="left">Each year US News and World Report releases college rankings 
        that are widely published and read, and for the past few years, Bowdoin 
        College has fallen from five to seven and now ten in 2003. </p>
      <p>While ten is still respectable, the drop begs the question of why Bowdoin 
        is falling. One large contribution is that Bowdoin ranks 66 in faculty 
        resources, which accounts for 20 percent of the overall ranking. This 
        ranking is far lower than any of the other schools in the top ten, the 
        next lowest being Wellesley at number 27. </p>
      <p>US News and World Report college rankings are based on seven different 
        subdivided categories. These categories include peer assessment, retention 
        and graduation of students, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial 
        resources, alumni giving, and graduation rate performance. </p>
      <p>Faculty resources is divided into six categories, including faculty compensation 
        (35 percent), classes under 20 (30 percent), classes over 49 (10 percent), 
        faculty with terminal degree-the highest degree one can achieve in their 
        respective field (15 percent), full-time faculty (5 percent), and the 
        student to faculty ratio (5 percent).</p>
      <p>Faculty compensation is where Bowdoin falls far behind. This takes into 
        account salary and benefits. Compensation accounts for 35 percent of the 
        faculty resources score, and 7 percent of the overall ranking. To calculate 
        the faculty compensation rating, US News and World Report averages the 
        salaries of all professors. Dean of Academic Affairs Craig McEwen says 
        that Bowdoin's poor rating is due to the high percentage of young assistant 
        professors at Bowdoin. About 38 percent of Bowdoin professors are assistant 
        professors, while 35 percent are full professors. These percentages are 
        compared to first-rated Williams and third-rated Swarthmore, whose faculties 
        are both nearly 50 percent professors. Dean McEwen said that the high 
        percentage of assistant professors is due to replacing recently-retired 
        professors, and decreasing the student to faculty ratio which was almost 
        12:1 in the 90s and is now 10:1.</p>
      <p>It would be &quot;more rational [of US News and World Report] to compute 
        differently, to normalize the distribution,&quot; says Dean McEwen. Normalizing 
        the distribution would remove the age factor from faculty compensation 
        and take into account only how well the college pays professors, associate 
        professors, and assistant professors compared to other similar institutions. 
        Bowdoin &quot;simply doesn't pay as well,&quot; as other liberal arts 
        schools, but Bowdoin &quot;pays better than it looks&quot; in the rankings, 
        he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;I understand how important it is to the public perception how colleges 
        are ranked; however, it isn't as valuable as all the notoriety makes them 
        seem,&quot; said Bowdoin College President Barry Mills. President Mills 
        said that Bowdoin cares a great deal about class size and is constantly 
        working to improve education and raise the ratings. </p>
      <p>Professor Paul Franco agreed that &quot;the ratings are not representative 
        of the intrinsic value of the education,&quot; but &quot;they are clearly 
        important to high school seniors in choosing schools,&quot; and Bowdoin 
        wants to recruit top students. Professor Franco also noted that the rankings 
        &quot;are not a guide to the authentic value,&quot; because &quot;the 
        numbers are too easily manipulated. For example, class size-schools can 
        have cutoffs at 19 students, which allows them to do better in that category, 
        but the educational purpose is unclear.&quot;</p>
      <p>Bowdoin College does not &quot;want to run the college based on US News 
        and World Report rankings-they are arbitrary in changing,&quot; said McEwen, 
        but ratings matter enough to prospective students that Bowdoin is trying 
        to improve their rating in faculty resources.</p>
      <p>McEwen said that Bowdoin will change &quot;marginally faculty compensation, 
        and marginally the percent of full-time faculty. In the past, these figures 
        may have been underestimated.&quot; In 2003 the percent of full-time faculty 
        was 92 percent, but Dean McEwen said that in 2004 the percent of full-time 
        faculty is closer to 95 percent. </p>
      <p>The rankings from 2003 also do not reflect the new policy of capping 
        classes that Bowdoin has implemented. This will reduce the rating for 
        classes over 49 students but not the rating for percent of classes with 
        less than 20 students. For 2003, Bowdoin also had a comparatively low 
        rating for classes under 20 students. 60 percent of classes were under 
        20 students, while top-rated schools like Williams, Amherst, and Swarthmore 
        were all between 67 percent and 70 percent.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the debate as to whether college rankings are accurate in 
        the value of the education they portray rages on. Atlantic Monthly Magazine 
        jumped on board the lucrative college-evaluating industry and released 
        a college rankings list in its November 2003 issue, challenging the rankings 
        of US News and World Report. For instance, Atlantic Monthly ranked the 
        University of Chicago at no. 39, while US News and World Report puts Chicago 
        at no. 13. Atlantic Monthly is more simplistic in that it examines the 
        selectivity of the institution, the median SAT score, and the class rank 
        of the students,</p>
      <p>As for Bowdoin and its faculty resources, the Bowdoin administration 
        says that the numbers will not be changing dramatically any time soon. 
        President Mills said, &quot;we are certainly aware of it and trying to 
        make judgments as to how we can do better,&quot; but that the public should 
        keep in mind that there are &quot;very, very small differences that get 
        magnified, and there are small differences between schools, whether they 
        are ranked number six or number 66.&quot;<br>
