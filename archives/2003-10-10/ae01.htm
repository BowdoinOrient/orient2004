      They love The Big Lebowski, Phish, and their first-year proctor.
<p align="left">No, we're not talking about your roommate, your best friend, 
        or the girls across the hall. These are the guys of the Jim Weeks Philharmonic, 
        a campus band looking to tackle Bowdoin with their funk, blues, and rock 
        tunes.</p>
      <p>The all-star jam funk band has made a name for itself since arriving 
        on Bowdoin's campus just over a year ago. Jim Weeks Philharmonic is made 
        up of guitarists Eric Davich '06 and Phil Friedrich '06, bassist Ely Delman 
        '06, and drummer Dan Wilson '06. Together they have toured the campus, 
        playing at campus wides, art shows, and participating in last spring's 
        Battle of the Bands contest. The Philharmonic was the youngest band on 
        campus last year and it accomplished more in performances and gained more 
        popularity in one year than many other campus bands do in four.</p>
      <p>But the story of Jim Weeks Philharmonic has its ups and downs. As is 
        the cause with many famous bands, trying to figure out their sound and 
        finding direction were two troubles they encountered. However, the common 
        bond the four members share has helped them stick through the tough times 
        and become one of the leading bands on campus. </p>
      <p>The Jim Weeks Philharmonic came together in the fall of 2002. Dan Wilson 
        was looking for a few guys to play a couple of jam sessions with. His 
        search led him right across the first floor of Maine Hall to fellow first-year 
        Phil Friedrich. &quot;When I found out he played guitar, all I could say 
        was, that's awesome,&quot; said Wilson of best friend and bandmate Friedrich.</p>
      <p>After discovering that he and Friedrich had a definite musical chemistry, 
        Wilson went hunting to find the other members. Like many other ambitious 
        Bowdoin musicians, he advertised in the student digest, made posters, 
        and spread the word that he wanted to start a band and needed a bassist 
        and singer. Quick to respond was first-year Ely Delman. The three instantly 
        saw that they shared a musical bond. The final member to join was Eric 
        Davich '06 as another guitarist and vocalist.</p>
      <p>Once the foursome gathered, they faced a very important question-one 
        that would make or break the popularity of the group. </p>
      <p>They needed to find a name. </p>
      <p>Toying with several ideas, an idea dawned upon the group living in Maine 
        Hall. &quot;Jim Weeks, our proctor, is the freakin' s***, so we named 
        the band after him,&quot; said Wilson. That proved to be the name that 
        gave the proctor and band fame all around campus.</p>
      <p>&quot;I was honored that they named it after me,&quot; said Weeks. &quot;So 
        many people have come up to me, telling me how they are going to come 
        see me play; if they only knew.&quot;</p>
      <p>Weeks also recalled the story of when the guys came up with the name. 
        &quot;I remember they were hanging out on the Quad one day when I walked 
        by and asked what was going on,&quot; recalled Weeks. &quot;We started 
        kicking around ideas and then Dan decided they were going to name it after 
        me. I thought they were kidding until I saw the posters.&quot;</p>
      <p>The band gained notice from the student body after opening for several 
        campus bands, including Stoic. The members then decided to try a different 
        entourage by adding a brass section. The horn added a sound that did not 
        fit well and questioned the musical direction of the band. After many 
        emails and discussions about where the band wanted to go, the horn section 
        was dropped from the group, but with no hard feelings. </p>
      <p>Many listeners feel as though the band covers a whole range of songs. 
      </p>
      <p>&quot;They could be playing a funk song one minute, then playing some 
        classic rock or jam band song the next,&quot; said band friend and fan 
        Fariha Mahmud '06. &quot;They seem to cover more than one genre. I think 
        that is the reason why I like to listen to them, because they don't stick 
        to one specific type of music and are willing to experiment.&quot;</p>
      <p>Already, this year, they have played two successful gigs at Quinby's 
        Funk Party and Helmreich's Coffee House, resulting in many new fans and 
        the return of old ones. But if you have yet to hear the fantastic four, 
        check them out when they play a few of their favorites such as their cover 
        of U2's &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; and &quot;2001 Funk Odyssey&quot; 
        on Halloween at Quinby House. </p>
      <p>Despite the struggles of forming a new band, the guys of Jim Weeks look 
        forward to performing again this fall. Returning with a new attitude, 
        fresh ideas, and a &quot;scrumtulescent&quot; sound, they're ready to 
        get the party started.<br>
