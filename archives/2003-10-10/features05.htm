      Penny Martin's little red desk sits in the center of her office in Ashby 
      House. On it there are no papers strewn about or month-old post-it notes 
      losing their adhesive cling-just a toy school bus, a photo of a little girl, 
      and a jar of pens. It's not your typical professorial desk. 
      <p>Then again, Penny Martin isn't your typical professor. Last semester 
        Bowdoin Student Government awarded Penny its &quot;Professor of the Semester&quot; 
        award &quot;in recognition of tremendous dedication to both the art and 
        craft of teaching and an unending sense of devotion to students.&quot; 
        Martin received the award following a campus-wide selection process in 
        which students submitted stories of outstanding professional and personal 
        experiences that they have had with their professors.</p>
      <p>One could say Martin had it coming. She has overseen the expansion of 
        the Education Department for the past sixteen years. When she started 
        she was the only professor in the department. </p>
      <p>&quot;I was absolutely na&iuml;ve,&quot; she remembers. &quot;Professor 
        Wells Johnson came up and asked me if I knew what it meant to be a department 
        of one. I just thought it meant the department would run really smoothly.&quot;</p>
      <p>As she took over Bowdoin's increasingly popular teacher certification 
        program as well as courses about issues in education, Martin found out 
        that being the only member really meant doing, well, everything.</p>
      <p>But Martin arrived at Bowdoin having already done quite a bit. After 
        graduating from Middlebury and earning a Master of Arts in Teaching at 
        Harvard, Penny headed west to Pomona, California, where she taught high 
        school English. After deciding she was an &quot;East Coast&quot; person, 
        she returned to New England, spending a few years teaching on Cape Cod. 
        She later returned to Harvard to receive her Ed.D.</p>
      <p>At Bowdoin, Professor Martin took over a forty-year-old department, albeit 
        one that had the same one professor since its inception The College had 
        been graduating certified teachers since the 70s, but when the state of 
        Maine began to hint that the small size of the department was barely enough 
        to allow the College to certify teachers, Bowdoin hired another professor, 
        Nancy Jennings. </p>
      <p>Since then, the Education Department has seen a steady rise in the number 
        of students interested in teaching. Martin attributes more recent increases 
        to a reaction to the Wall Street get-rich-quick mentality of the 90s, 
        as well as a greater sense of community service among students. &quot;Students 
        want to live lives that mean something beyond one's self,&quot; Martin 
        says.</p>
      <p>The expanded offerings of the Education Department have appealed to students 
        who, while not necessarily interested in a teaching career, want to learn 
        more about educational issues. Martin describes the popular Education 
        101, broadly titled &quot;Contemporary American Education,&quot; as &quot;liberal-artsy&quot; 
        in that it relates to all of our lives. She dismisses the idea that the 
        Education Department is set apart from the other academic departments 
        at Bowdoin because it trains students for a particular career, pointing 
        to the lack of an &quot;education&quot; major and the requirement that 
        students seeking certification major in another academic field.</p>
      <p>Students make the difference in Penny's life, and her wall features photographs 
        of past classes she has gotten to know well. &quot;I love the chance to 
        work with talented, eager, bright students who will one day make a difference,&quot; 
        she says. She relishes the exchange of learning that goes on in her classes; 
        she sees the roles of &quot;teacher&quot; and &quot;student&quot; as interchangeable 
        in the classroom.</p>
      <p>This leads to a lot of memorable tales, but one of Penny's favorite stories-she 
        has many to share-comes not from Bowdoin but Cape Cod. It deals with that 
        girl in the photograph, her great niece Madeline. One Thanksgiving, Madeline 
        was restless, unsatisfied with her usual assortment of books and videos. 
        So Penny decided to introduce her to Noel.</p>
      <p>At this point, Professor Martin begins to reenact her story, heading 
        over to the shelves on her office wall and returning with hands cupped 
        as if holding a small animal. But it's no animal. It's Noel, the invisible 
        little person who has come to visit Madeline to free her from the clutches 
        of boredom. The niece's eyes fill wide with wonder, and Penny Martin's 
        magical creation comes to life, earning it a place at the dinner table 
        and special attention from all.</p>
      <p>&quot;It took over our lives,&quot; Penny remembers with little hint 
        of exaggeration. But one gets the feeling that whatever headaches Noel 
        caused-he hung around for awhile-they were worth it. For proof, just look 
        at the 3x5&quot; photo on Penny's desk, which shows Madeline, face full 
        of excitement, holding Noel in the palm of her hand. One of Professor 
        Martin's many gifts seems to be an uncanny ability to find joy and wonder 
        in the most delicate of life's many layers and to open others' eyes to 
        her discoveries. Looking at that photo, it's hard to deny that, despite 
        being invisible, there was something very real about Noel.</p>
      <p>Soon Penny will move that photo, along with the rest of her office, to 
        a new space in Kanbar Hall. Kanbar, slated to open in Fall 2004, will 
        house the education and psychology departments as well as a classroom 
        and laboratory space.</p>
      <p>&quot;I am delighted to be heading back to campus,&quot; says Penny, 
        who for years lamented Ashby House's location across busy Maine Street 
        and away from students. Her first office at Bowdoin was in Sills, and 
        students would stop by to chat on a regular basis, something her third-floor 
        office in Ashby doesn't allow. &quot;The subject matter of teaching is 
        students,&quot; she says. &quot;I need students.&quot;</p>
      <p>The move will be a win-win; students need Penny Martin too.<br>
