        <font size="2">BRIAN DUNN<br>

        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>

      <p align="left">Bowdoin's administration, dining service, and alcohol consumption 
        will be put to the test in the coming weeks when The Princeton Review 
        begins a survey of campus life at Bowdoin for its annual &quot;The Best 
        351 Colleges&quot; guide.</p>
      <p>The Princeton Review, one of the premier names in the college rankings 
        business, gauges 63 different areas of life at the College for its annually 
        published undergraduate guidebook. </p>
      <p>The information gathered by the company is used for three issues of &quot;The 
        Best 351 Colleges.&quot; Thus many of the changes occurring each year 
        in the rankings are compared relatively with other institutions because 
        the company receives one-third of its data fresh every year. </p>
      <p>At Bowdoin, the company generally hires one or two students to distribute 
        surveys that are completed and mailed back to headquarters in New York 
        City. More recently, online surveys, which have increased response rates, 
        have become available.</p>
      <p>The student conducting the survey at Bowdoin will begin the process by 
        the end of October, according to The Princeton Review and Director of 
        Communications Scott Hood. The website, however, (www.survey.review.com) 
        is already operational.</p>
      <p>Surveys for &quot;The Best 351 Colleges&quot; generate rankings for 60 
        of the 63 categories such as &quot;Best Food,&quot; &quot;Lots of Beer,&quot; 
        and &quot;Dorms Like Palaces&quot; exclusively through student opinion. 
        The other three categories, &quot;Toughest to Get Into,&quot; &quot;Best 
        Academic Bang for Your Buck,&quot; and &quot;Best Overall Academics,&quot; 
        are empirically based. </p>
      <p>Hood said that the methods used by the The Princeton Review was unique 
        because students determine many of the rankings. </p>
      <p>&quot;This is the one survey where student's opinions are crucial to 
        the image of the College,&quot; he said. </p>
      <p>Hood also said that basing the image of a school on subjective standards 
        can be a double-edged sword. &quot;The Princeton Review is very fond of 
        catchy quotes in its 'Students Say' section. The one quip a student writes 
        in the survey could have a very large impact on what he or she reads about 
        Bowdoin a year from now.&quot; </p>
      <p>Due to the frequency of its visits to campuses, The Princeton Review 
        has also faced criticism from the Bowdoin administration. </p>
      <p>Dean of Admissions Jim Miller said, &quot;The changes in the student 
        body at Bowdoin over the past several years have been significant. But 
        a student reading this year's guidebook won't know anything about those 
        changes because the 2003-10-10 review is based on three-year-old data.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Basically, we're comparing what Williams students said about Williams 
        today to what Bowdoin students said about Bowdoin three years ago,&quot; 
        Hood said. </p>
      <p>This accounts for changes in the rankings every year. Since Bowdoin is 
        not reviewed on an annual basis, it shifts positions in the ranks due 
        to its relative place among colleges nationwide.</p>
      <p>Robert Franek, Editorial Director for The Princeton Review, and author 
        of numerous college guidebooks including &quot;The Best 351 Colleges,&quot; 
        said, &quot;I don't think that schools inherently change over a three 
        year period.&quot; Franek also said, &quot;I have no intention of changing 
        our three-year survey cycle unless shown compelling evidence that student 
        opinion dramatically changes in shorter rotation.&quot;</p>
      <p>Miller, however, said he believes that by reporting information &quot;in 
        as timely a manner as possible,&quot; students will ultimately be more 
        informed. </p>
      <p>In the 2004 edition, the &quot;Students Say&quot; section contains comments 
        on diversity from the classes of 2003 and 2002. Both classes were more 
        than 85 percent Caucasian. The Class of 2003 graduated only two African-Americans. 
        Three out of ten students in the class of 2007, however, are students 
        of color. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the 2004 guidebook stressed Bowdoin's homogeneity. One student 
        opinion remains from three years ago. &quot;Good thing this campus is 
        traditionally liberal and open-minded, otherwise we would be confused 
        for a white-pride meeting.&quot; </p>
      <p>Franek understands the process isn't a science. He said, &quot;I will 
        grant a request for a special survey if the administration can prove that 
        there has been a significant change in student opinion.&quot; Since the 
        inception of the &quot;Best 351 Colleges&quot; guidebook, Franek said 
        he grants special reviews once or twice per year. <br>
