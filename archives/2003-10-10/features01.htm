        <font size="2">ADAM BABER WITH EVAN KOHN<br>

        ORIENT STAFF</font></p>

      <p align="left">I no longer wonder why teeny New Hampshire earned the right 
        to influence national politics-no politician can handle Washington if 
        they can't handle Hampton Falls.</p>
      <p align="left">One of the innumerable little hamlets that lie on Route 
        One between Canada and Key West, Hampton Falls is made up of a couple 
        of intersections, a post office, a coffee shop that apparently isn't open 
        on Sundays (or at least when there are out-of-towners visiting) and of 
        course, its residents. </p>
      <p>Last Sunday the town snapped out of its single stoplight-induced haze 
        to welcome North Carolina Senator and presidential contender John Edwards 
        to its town gazebo. While I'm not from New Hampshire or even a registered 
        Democrat, I wanted to join in the fun. So, along with friend and Orient 
        colleague Evan Kohn, I headed down to see and hear democracy in action.</p>
      <p>The &quot;town meeting&quot; with Edwards was slated to start at 11:30 
        a.m., and we arrived just before 11. We were the first ones there except 
        for Dan, Andrew, and Mackenzie and her cocker spaniel Bailey.<br>
        All four work for the Edwards campaign and were standing there on Route 
        One, holding posters and wagging tails in the hopes that some of the Sunday 
        morning travelers would honk in support or, better yet, stop for the meeting. 
        Many honked. Few stopped.</p>
      <p>As one would expect, these young campaign workers were personable folks, 
        and before long Evan and I found ourselves holding posters and watching 
        Andrew-by far the wildest of the group-dash across the street when the 
        stoplight permitted. We proceeded to search for a bathroom and a quick 
        bite to eat. Walking down Route One past Barn Antiques, Apple Crest Orchards, 
        and Agway Farm and Garden Supplies, we found neither.</p>
      <p>Before long it was time to head to the town green. Anchored at one end 
        by a plain vanilla gazebo and at the other by a taller-than-usual flagpole 
        and a few ceremonial cannons, the green was framed by the one-hundred 
        year-old First Baptist Church, a one-story brick elementary school, and 
        Route One. </p>
      <p>There were about thirty chairs set up, and it was clear to Evan and me 
        that this was going to be an intimate gathering. Like ten year-olds at 
        the newest action flick, we grabbed front-row seats and waited for the 
        show to begin. Our chairs rested on a paved brick section in front of 
        the gazebo, and we noticed many of the bricks had names and dates carved 
        into them. Most of the bricks memorialized deceased relatives of Hampton 
        Falls residents, but one in particular stood out. It asked, presumably 
        in reference to fallen soldiers, &quot;Am I worth their sacrifice?&quot; 
        The small-town-America setting was too perfect for such contemplation.</p>
      <p>The seats slowly filled with residents and a few reporters, presumably 
        from the local media. There were a couple of whole families there, but 
        most of the audience was composed of middle-aged and older couples. Several 
        wore &quot;Edwards for President&quot; stickers and buttons. One wore 
        an &quot;I'm a Health Care Voter&quot; sticker. And in a subtle and probably 
        unintentional bit of political disregard, an elderly man wore a &quot;USS 
        Ronald Reagan&quot; cap. The area buzzed with hushed conversations about 
        what to expect and-more urgently-what to ask. While there were still a 
        few chairs available, some chose to stand in the back. They had never 
        been to something like this before. </p>
      <p>11:30 came and passed with no signs of &quot;the Senator,&quot; as the 
        campaign crew called him. Dan, with whom we had been holding posters on 
        Route One, sat down next to us. Dan is a senior at Salem State College 
        in New Hampshire, just outside Boston, and had just come out that day 
        to volunteer. We exchanged the usual questions and answers about college 
        life. </p>
      <p>At around 11:55 one of the campaign workers announced that &quot;the 
        Senator&quot; was caught in traffic on Route One, but then proceeded to 
        predict that he'd arrive in a mere two minutes. With a smirk Evan told 
        me he was getting chills-he's been a close follower of Edwards. I, too, 
        had chills. I should have worn a jacket.</p>
      <p>Edwards arrived in a late-model white Oldsmobile Silhouette. He hopped 
        out, donned his blue blazer, and stepped in front of a standing and applauding 
        crowd of about forty. After shaking hands with the front row, he began.</p>
      <p>The opening five-minute speech had an extemporaneous feel to it, but 
        Edwards' command of the issues-jobs, the economy, civil rights-was certain. 
        As the son of a mill worker and the first in his family to go to college, 
        Edwards said he speaks up for &quot;regular people,&quot; by fighting 
        to protect them against corporate America, improving public education, 
        and working to offer everyone health insurance. He said he will provide 
        students one year of free tuition to public universities and community 
        colleges. In return, students will be required to come to college academically 
        prepared and to work or serve their communities for an average of 10 hours 
        each week. The speech was short, which allowed the senator to get right 
        to his audience's questions-but not before a campaign worker handed him 
        a Diet Coke.</p>
      <p>The predictable issues-Iraq, education, taxes-were raised, and the candidate 
        spoke with fluency and ease. He made eye contact with the questioners, 
        briefly pausing to give relevant issues sufficient thought and craft substantive 
        answers. I suppose one expects nothing less from a serious Presidential 
        candidate, and Edwards did get his start as a trial lawyer. But there 
        was still something special about the give-and-take nature of the exchange, 
        especially when compared to the highly scripted debates we all hear on 
        television.</p>
      <p>The most memorable moment came when a union carpenter, standing in the 
        back, queried Edwards about health care, drawing a very personal response 
        from the candidate in which he revealed that his sister-in-law has had 
        health problems that have been dealt with successfully only through union-offered 
        health insurance. Edwards leaned over the front row and the exchange continued 
        as though the rest of the crowd wasn't even there.</p>
      <p>After the end of the meeting Edwards stayed to chat with audience members 
        individually. Evan asked the senator about the Patriot Act and its effects 
        on college students' privacy. &quot;There's no reason to worry,&quot; 
        Edwards said. &quot;It's very unlikely the government would get involved 
        [in a way that threatened students' private records]. There are some great 
        parts of the Patriot Act, but this part should certainly be changed.&quot;</p>
      <p>The whole event lasted about an hour and a half and by 1:00 it was time 
        for the senator to move on to his next appearance. He hadn't faced many 
        tough questions from the mostly friendly crowd (one reporter briefly tried 
        to spar with him), but he had faced a crowd nonetheless. These were the 
        people who would help shape the character of the November election. One 
        gets the feeling that, for a candidate, facing these voters is arguably 
        more frightening-and certainly more important-than facing anyone in Washington. 
        And when the little Hampton Falls gazebo stands taller than the dome of 
        the U.S. Capitol, you know that the sacrifice recalled by those little 
        bricks was indeed worth it.<br>
