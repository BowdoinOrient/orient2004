        COLUMNIST</font></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left"> 1981: Conan the Barbarian is released, starring Arnold 
        Schwarzenegger as Conan. At the end of the movie, Conan is asked what 
        is best in life. He replies, &quot;To crush your enemies, see them driven 
        before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.&quot; </p>
      <p>Flash forward to 2003. Enemies crushed? Check. Lamentation of women? 
        Check. </p>
      <p>In the final days of the California recall, with Governor Schwarzenegger 
        seeming less a fevered nightmare and more a possible reality, a litany 
        of charges came out suggesting he fell somewhere between being guilty 
        of a wandering eye, and single-handedly setting male-female relations 
        back to the Stone Age, with men clubbing women over the heads and dragging 
        them back to their caves by the hair. </p>
      <p>Such accusations (many of which I'm sure are true) of course beg a comparison 
        with Bill Clinton, who would surprise no one if he took the opposite course 
        of Schwarzenegger and went from politician to movie star (American Pie 
        4?), if not all the way to Mr. Universe. For some reason though, Clinton, 
        for all his harassment going back decades, was beloved by organizations 
        such as NOW. The difference?</p>
      <p>&quot;The difference is that Clinton was so brilliant. If Arnold was 
        this brilliant pol and had this thing about inappropriate behavior, we'd 
        figure a way of getting around it,&quot; said Patricia Foulkrod, a Codepink 
        activist and film producer. </p>
      <p>At least she's honest. It was okay for Clinton because he was so brilliant, 
        but Arnold's a dumb ox with a thick accent and a political affiliation 
        with the GOP. Isn't there something twisted about this? Shouldn't something 
        that is wrong still be wrong regardless of IQ? Of course, and Foulkrod 
        knows this. That's the twisted part. </p>
      <p>But somehow modern liberalism has given intelligence ultimate value. 
        Nothing else matters and everything else is relative. Unless you are actively 
        trying to prove your mental worth by disproving everyone who has come 
        before you, unless you're arguing that they all had it wrong but miracle 
        of miracles, you figured it out, you might as well be sitting around making 
        grunting noises, hitting others on the head with rocks and staring in 
        amazement at the magic of fire. If it's new, if it's bold, if it hasn't 
        been tried before, it simply must be tried! It's brilliant! It could be 
        revolutionary! </p>
      <p>This isn't to mock intelligence or to argue the merits of a mediocre 
        mind, but instead to question why smarts have become the excuse that privilege 
        used to be. We used to wink at bosses and presidents who behaved inappropriately 
        because they were powerful and privileged and boys will be boys and so 
        on. Now, we let them off because they're brilliant. </p>
      <p>Intelligence is crucial, but it isn't easy to measure intelligence in 
        our elected officials, so we use signals, indicators that give us a clue. 
        We stereotype. One of the signals we use is party affiliation. Democrats 
        get the benefit of the doubt over Republicans. This isn't necessarily 
        wrong-Republicans are more interested in promoting candidates who will 
        uphold traditional, time-tested policies. Their candidates are therefore 
        less likely to be on the cutting edge of new ideas. </p>
      <p>Over time, Democrats have come to be seen as members of the 'intelligent' 
        party. Their ideas are well&#133;progressive, regardless of whether their 
        changes truly bring progress. </p>
      <p>At the same time, those who argue that the best candidate is the most 
        intelligent candidate recoil in horror at the suggestion that we assess 
        people's IQ via a test, so that we would actually have some measurement 
        of their intellectual ability. The results of tests like the SATs could 
        then be used for admission to colleges and universities! No no no. The 
        tests are biased. Well, okay, but certainly we're measuring our candidates 
        intelligence some way?</p>
      <p>And we do. We measure intelligence through policy. Gun control is smarter 
        than no gun control. Abortion is more progressive than no abortion. Higher 
        taxes are more socially just and therefore more enlightened than lower 
        taxes. </p>
      <p>Bill Clinton is indeed a smart man, not just for his academic achievements, 
        but for the manner in which he can read people and understand what they 
        want and need to hear. However, he achieved 'brilliant' status amongst 
        his supporters for his liberalism. Show me a member of the environmental 
        lobby who may disagree on policy but thinks George Bush is intelligent 
        and I'll show you someone who's going to lose his status as a member in 
        good standing of the Sierra Club.</p>
      <p>I'm no fan of recalls, and I'm wary of a Guh-vah-nay-tah Ah-nold. There 
        is no way or reason to defend his inappropriate actions, just as there 
        shouldn't have been a way to defend Clinton's. I'm not even surprised 
        that some would ignore what is inconvenient for the advancement of their 
        politics. Both parties do that. The distressing part is the logic that 
        the intelligent must always be right and more pure. By my last count, 
        there were about 5,000 movies about evil geniuses making this point. As 
        we make the personal more and more political, we risk driving out the 
        best candidates of both parties, most of whom are intelligent but know 
        that there is more to governing than what amounts to public perception.
