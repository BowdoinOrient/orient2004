      <p align="left"> Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner): I had no idea you could milk 
        a cat.</p>

      <p>Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro): I have nipples, Greg. Could you milk me?</p>
      <p>There are some key moments in any Bowdoin relationship: the first date, 
        the first kiss, the first sober kiss&#133;Valentine's Day, birthdays, 
        the Gala&#133;but nothing sends chills down the spine quite like Parents 
        Weekend. I admit it is quite nice that the ten percent of Bowdoin parents 
        who do not live within a two-hour drive can see their children for the 
        first time in six weeks, but whoever came up with such a plan really did 
        not think of the stress this can put on romance beneath the Pines. Protocol 
        is so ambiguous. So, this week I examine etiquette appropriate for those 
        strange three days of the year when rooms are clean, the football team 
        wins, and we MEET THE PARENTS.</p>
      <p>Parents Weekend places no burden on one's sex life when a) a student 
        is in a long and serious relationship and the couple has already met each 
        other's parents or b) a student is decidedly single and hasn't so much 
        as hooked up this year. </p>
      <p>But what about Emily and Tyler, who have just started hooking up? It's 
        been pretty consistent for a few weeks now although there might have only 
        been one or two weeknight hang-outs. Em is afraid to bring up what will 
        happen this weekend and Tyler is still in the stages where he can't say 
        anything that would acknowledge the fact that they hook up. I can see 
        it now&#133;Emily is exiting the Polo store in Freeport just as Tyler 
        and his parents walk by with two large Brooks Brothers bags. What to do?</p>
      <p>First of all, what not to do: when two people who have neither discussed 
        their status nor finally stopped dodging the questions of their status 
        encounter parents, they must, at all costs, avoid awkwardness. They should 
        not walk past the other person as if they have never seen him or her before, 
        especially when they were in his or her room Thursday night. They should 
        introduce each other as if they were friends (&quot;Mom, Dad, this is 
        Tyler;&quot; &quot;Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Wellesley, MA. This is my dad, Mr. 
        Class of '68 and my stepmother Tiffany.&quot; etc, etc). I mean, they 
        are friends on some level. It is just not right to avoid someone when 
        you know them that intimately. Moreover, if the relationship goes anywhere, 
        it will make the conversation where Tyler accidentally admits he has a 
        girlfriend much easier, as his dad might have some idea who he's talking 
        about. Emily should not however say, &quot;Mom, Dad, this is my boyfriend, 
        Tyler.&quot; It is absolutely not okay to call someone a boyfriend or 
        a girlfriend for the first time in front of anyone's parents. </p>
      <p>If two people have already established that they are in fact together, 
        the first parent meeting should be mentioned before hand, even if it's 
        just a quick and informal introduction on the sidelines of the field hockey 
        game. The titles (&quot;boyfriend&quot; and &quot;girlfriend&quot;) are 
        certainly not necessary, but prep the parental units so that they do not 
        say &quot;Oh, hello Betsey, it's so nice to meet you. Brad's never mentioned 
        you before. Now how do you two know each other?&quot; Everyone has a different 
        sort of relationship with their parents and no one can assume what has 
        or has not been disclosed. </p>
      <p>A couple that has been together since last year, for example, but still 
        has not &quot;met the parents&quot; must be sure to make intros if either 
        one's legal guardians are present this weekend. Tommy has a rule that 
        he refuses to introduce girlfriends to his parents under any circumstances 
        (Parents Weekend being no exception) until after six months; needless 
        to say, none of his relationships have lasted that long.</p>
      <p>A very sticky situation arises if a couple has recently broken up and 
        this will be the first time the exes see each other's parents since. Then 
        I'm assuming they have met before; should they have not yet made acquaintance, 
        don't even go there. If the former flames are on speaking terms and/or 
        do not have restraining orders prohibiting physical proximity, it is imperative 
        that the laws of tact and common courtesy be adhered to. Stu and Sally 
        Splitsville must at least smile and say something like &quot;Hello, Mr. 
        I-Broke-Your-Son's-Heart, it's so nice to see you. We're late for the 
        step show or else I'd stay and talk. Have a nice weekend!&quot; As illustrated, 
        graceful exits are not only permitted but are actually encouraged. </p>
      <p>I repeat: avoiding awkwardness is of the essence. </p>
      <p>One advantage of the bubble being invaded by mothers, fathers, stepfathers 
        and ex-stepmothers is that they keep people on their best behavior. Unless 
        you are Nomar Garciaparra's son introducing your dad to Mr. Jeter, parents 
        tend to have a calming effect on the campus. This is why I urge each Polar 
        Bear to take the high road, be the bigger person, and take advantage of 
        this one weekend when emotions are in check to be mature and do what you 
        know is right. You'll have enough to worry about when Big Top closes by 
        3 p.m. due to a depleted supply of sandwich materials-trust me, it's happened 
        before.</p>
      <p>Jack Byrnes: I will be watching you and if I find that you are trying 
        to corrupt my first-born child, I will bring you down, baby. I will bring 
        you down to Chinatown!<br>
