      Following Bill Murray around Japan is a worthy enough cause for a two-hour 
      study break relaxing on the couches in the front row of the Eveningstar, 
      but Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation guarantees to give you much more 
      than comedic commentary on culture clash.
<p>The actual storyline is rather somber, but is set up amidst a sea of 
        smart slapstick and nearly off-color humor, all rendered in Murray's legendary 
        straight face. His character, Bob Harris, is an American movie star-turned-Japanese 
        whiskey endorser, who spends his time in Tokyo avoiding his overly-generous 
        Japanese hosts, mocking his commercial's non-English speaking director, 
        and rolling his eyes over his wife's incessant faxes regarding the interior 
        decoration of their house halfway around the world. </p>
      <p>While Murray's inimitable depiction of his character lets us laugh off 
        these little absurdities of life, at the end of the day Bob is left sitting 
        at the hotel bar just trying to get away from it all. However, between 
        lousy lounge singers and star-struck Americans, that simple task seems 
        practically impossible. </p>
      <p>While Bob lies sleepless in his hotel bed, a fellow insomniac and future 
        friend sits awake down the hall. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a newlywed 
        and recent Yale graduate, lies awake wondering what she will do with her 
        life and why she ever married the workaholic photographer John (Giovanni 
        Ribisi), who snores easily beside her. </p>
      <p>Her contemplation continues when John leaves for photo shoots in the 
        morning, and she lingers about the hotel bedroom, staring out the window 
        into the strange city and listening to soul-searching books-on-tape. </p>
      <p>While Charlotte has no sense of where she is going, and Bob is indifferent 
        towards where he has been, both characters despise the fabricated focus 
        of the people around them. However, they have yet to find satisfaction 
        being lost in themselves.</p>
      <p>After a few charmingly awkward encounters in the hotel, Charlotte buys 
        Bob a drink, and the two become fast friends. Though they relate through 
        a joint appreciation for good conversation and drunken karaoke, their 
        true connection is manifested in a mutual cynicism toward life. They bring 
        each other different perspectives on this shared sentiment. Bob is middle-aged 
        and bored while Charlotte is young and lost, but both are equally and 
        utterly unfulfilled. </p>
      <p>While their bond goes beyond friendship, it is not quite romantic. They 
        understand each other in a way that their old friends and spouses never 
        will, and the acknowledgement of that intimacy is all they need. At a 
        crucial point in both of their lives, just when no one seems to understand, 
        they find each other.</p>
      <p>The script is both clever and compelling, and the casting is impeccable, 
        but the true brilliance of Lost in Translation lies in its ability to 
        go beyond a basic storyline while still proving applicable to any audience. 
        Bob and Charlotte are easy to relate to, yet very far from generic. </p>
      <p>After watching these likeable, intelligent characters find some simple 
        solace through friendship, we discover that this same desire is harbored 
        somewhere deep within ourselves. We would like to think we could step 
        in for Charlotte or Bob and not miss a beat. We'd like to think that we 
        understand, too. The good news is that chances are, if you enjoy this 
        movie, you do.</p>
      <p>So, even if you're looking for another Caddyshack or What about Bob?, 
        go to Lost In Translation anyway. Just like Jim Carrey in The Truman Show, 
        we already know that Bill Murray is funny; give him the chance to show 
        you something new. Let's just hope he doesn't follow this respectable 
        stint with a sequel to The Majestic.</p>
      <p>Lost in Translation is now playing at the Eveningstar Cinema. </p>
