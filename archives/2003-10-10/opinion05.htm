      <p align="left"> This weekend many of us will be ailed by a common enough 
        encumbrance: The Parents. A self-diagnosis is straightforward. You walk 
        about slower than usual, feeling weighted down. You feel vast and conspicuous, 
        as if you require many chairs rather than one. You feel cramped. If you 
        have any of these symptoms, you definitely have TP.</p>
      <p>Especially common on Parents Weekend, TP is not unlike the common affliction 
        of constipation. Both involve transporting past pleasures-turned-present 
        pains across the Quad to class. You can't pay attention to lectures, and 
        your notes look like they were written by someone very angry. Sitting, 
        you sweat. Though you play it off as if everything is normal, everyone 
        knows why you're just not feeling right. No matter what you wear, no one 
        thinks you're hot.</p>
      <p>Worst of all, you can't share your pain with anyone. You don't want to 
        have to turn to drugs, but you need a release. You know if you could just 
        stop stressing out for one moment, have just a minute of peace by yourself, 
        then-yes!-your pain would clear up in a moment of Lysol-disinfected solitude 
        on a chair ringed with two-ply.</p>
      <p>Now, by making the connection between the anxiety and cramping caused 
        by one's parents and the similar anxiety and cramping caused by a stagnant 
        lower intestine, I am in no way insinuating that parents are fortnight-lodged 
        bowel movements. No, parents are not last week's theme dinner. The fact 
        that you would make a connection between TP and poop is, I think, a sign 
        of your own failing relationship to the people from whose loins you sprang 
        forth. And you're a potty-head.</p>
      <p>Regardless of how one feels on the inside, I believe Parents Weekend 
        as it is today is a good and noble thing (true). I've done some research 
        on the subject (false). There was a time when some of the events of Parents 
        Weekend had a way of enforcing &quot;what a family should look like.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Take, for example, the &quot;Biological Father-and-Son Basketball Tournament&quot; 
        or the &quot;Mothers of Two Children Afternoon Tea.&quot; You won't find 
        either of these events this weekend. Gone are those days when it was assumed 
        that parents were like testicles: every student had two. And, it is not 
        just the fact that there are now women at Bowdoin that has brought about 
        this change in the way we view the student body's. . . err, parents. Even 
        if you're born with two, that doesn't mean that 20-some years down the 
        road you still have what you started with. Parents, like testicles, are 
        not conserved quantities: you can gain and lose them over time.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Parents Weekend today is nothing if not a celebration of our 
        non-and-multi-testicled world. There have always been asymmetric households 
        just as there have always been guys who walk funny. Here at Bowdoin, we 
        embrace that. This Parents Weekend will have no exclusive events (though 
        I am told the &quot;You-Raised-My-Daughter-But-Now-I-Want-Her-Back! Mug 
        Fight&quot; was cut from Morell Lounge at the last minute). The posters 
        in Smith Union will offer enthusiastic cheers like: &quot;Guess how many 
        I've got?&quot; and &quot;Our Parents: askew and we love you!&quot;</p>
      <p>Okay, so I might have ventured a little below the belt. Certainly, I've 
        given you many reasons to walk funny. However, there's one thing I want 
        to make clear: associate whatever you want with your parents; at least 
        many of you will have your parents here to associate with, and for that 
        you should be thankful. So, if you're lucky enough to have 'em, regardless 
        of how many, show 'em off to your friends; maybe they'll show you theirs 
        (parents, sicko). Things that cannot be conserved should be shared.<br>
