        <font size="2">ELI MAITLAND<br>

        STAFF WRITER</font></p>

      <p align="left">Grades have begun to drop and class attendance rates are 
        plummeting. Close friends are snapping at each other and the infamous 
        &quot;Yankees Suck&quot; shirts are now more abundant than ever on campus. 
        This is the anomaly called playoff baseball.</p>
      <p>As a devoted Red Sox fan, I have never been more excited for the postseason. 
        After winning the American League Division Series in a dramatic three-game 
        comeback against Oakland, we (yes, &quot;we&quot; is how Sox fans refer 
        to their team) are now matched up against the Evil Empire also known as 
        the New York Yankees. We are battling it out in the American League Championship 
        Series for a chance to go to the World Series. This rivalry is without 
        a doubt the greatest in sports today, in which players dig in a little 
        deeper and fans scream a little louder (and yell obscenities, spit at 
        players, pour beer on each other, start fist fights, etc.).</p>
      <p>Now, everyone knows that Boston has the best sports fans in the country. 
        We are still rooting like crazy for a team in an 85-year championship 
        drought. (During that time, the Yankees have won a few championships here 
        and there, say, for example, 26-but who's counting?) Nowhere but in Boston 
        do the baseball fans invest so much in their team's success, and nowhere 
        else could you start a &quot;Yankees Suck&quot; chant when the hometown 
        team is playing Tampa Bay. Many would accuse Red Sox fans of being &quot;fair-weather 
        fans&quot; who get down on the team when it doesn't perform and get overly 
        excited when it does. To that, I say it's better for our fan base to show 
        negative emotion than to show no emotion at all, as is the case with many 
        other franchises. This shows the devastation we feel when the Sox let 
        us down and how much we truly care. By the same token, we love the Sox 
        even more when they are successful.</p>
      <p>However, despite the &quot;never ending&quot; and &quot;eternally positive&quot; 
        support of Sox fans, the Yanks have had the edge in recent years, seeing 
        as how we have not been in the World Series in the last 17 years. The 
        Yanks have been there a few times since then, winning, I don't know, maybe 
        four of the last seven, but again who's counting? </p>
      <p>This year, I believe something historic will happen. I believe that as 
        hell freezes over, the Red Sox will simultaneously beat the Yankees and 
        move on to the World Series to play the winner of the NLCS. </p>
      <p>I know this is true because of that little thing called destiny. I honestly 
        believe that the Red Sox are fated to finally go the distance after all 
        these years. Those of you who remember the 2001 Superbowl Champion New 
        England Patriots know what I'm talking about. Two words: tuck rule. This 
        is an obscure rule which essentially allowed quarterback Tom Brady to 
        fumble the ball and lose possession, then regain possession and win one 
        of the great NFL playoff games ever. No one knew this obsolete rule even 
        existed until it saved them from elimination and helped propel their upset 
        of the highly favored St. Louis Rams in the Superbowl. Now if that isn't 
        destiny, you tell me what is. </p>
      <p>With this series about to head back to Boston, intensity is now the name 
        of the game. In the past couple of weeks, I have watched as an infuriated 
        Sox fan got up from the lunch table and storm out of the dining hall in 
        response to an anti-Sox comment (made by a Yankees fan, of course). I 
        have found myself and others sitting three feet from the TV screen, hands 
        clasped together in prayer, shaking all over, begging for a Derek Lowe 
        strikeout (which indeed came). And after sustaining a minor jaw injury 
        from an attempted chest bump gone horribly wrong (following a Todd Walker 
        home run), I can attest as well as anyone to the amount of passion that 
        has ensued from the Red Sox-Yankees playoff series. I encourage all Sox 
        fans to follow Kevin Millar's advice (after all, he is a former Portland 
        Sea Dog) and &quot;cowboy up&quot; (I don't care if you're sick of this 
        term; I love it), because this is the year that the Red Sox go from cursed 
        to first.<br>
