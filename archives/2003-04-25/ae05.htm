      <p align="left">It's pretty stupid to write a column reviewing albums if 
        none of your readers buy and listen to albums. Internet file sharing programs 
        like Limwire and Kazaa have made the full-length album review more or 
        less obsolete, especially on a fully-wired campus where 60 percent of 
        everyone's hard drive is dedicated to storing mp3s. So, I'll be the first 
        to surrender and tailor my column from now on to accommodate this shift 
        in college music consumption, so from now on I'm just going to review 
        people. </p>
      <p align="left">
        People need guidance about people, I think, more than they need guidance 
        about music. If you want to know some bands to download on Kazaa, here 
        are some names:The Yeah Yeah Yeahs: if you're moving to New York, you 
        apparently have to have heard about this band to score any quality biscuits. 
        If you haven't, the girl you're hitting on will suggest you take the subway 
        up to Barnard to try your luck with the chubby pea coats up there.</p>

        Steve Malkmus and the Jicks-Pavement frontman releases new album that 
        brings a smile to anyone with an ironic sense of humor (I don't know what 
        this means, either) and an appreciation for off-key male singers. There 
        are no &quot;Jenny and the Ess-Dog's&quot; on this sophomore solo attempt, 
        but most of the songs retain that mixture of charm, pop and sarcasm that 
        has come to define Malkmus' solo work. Killer Mike-Turns your favorite 
        middle school acronym ADIDAS (All day I dream about Sex) into this year's 
        &quot;Bombs Over Baghdad.&quot; A swinging, humorous, party banger that 
        will educate (the Puerto Rican word for Biscuits is Chocha) and entertain 
        at once. Kristen Hersch-Only if you like Beth Orton, Aimee Mann, or Cat 
        Power. </p>
      <p>Catherine Zeta-Jones: zero stars</p>
      <p>Is her name Catherine Zeta-Jones-Douglass now? What do the children of 
        these hippies that hyphenate their last names expect their children to 
        do when they get married? I had a friend in grade school named Tim Porter-Devreis 
        and as early as the fourth grade, Tim was stressing out about which one 
        of his parents' names he would have taken when he got married. He liked 
        the name Porter better but thought that his dad would flip out if he dropped 
        his name. This is some heavy stuff to pile onto kids. See parents? See 
        what all your liberation and dancing around naked did? STDs are as common 
        as George Foreman Grills now and your kids are having major crises all 
        because you were into &quot;breaking down boundaries and freaking out 
        the squares, man&#133;&quot; </p>

        Sunday: four stars out of five stars</p>
      <p>I was in this pizza place trying to stretch four dollars as far as I 
        could, which was not far considering that this was New York. Not to mention 
        I'm not Italian, so the guy at the counter wasn't willing to cut me any 
        sort of break. This guy told me that he'd sell me a cold jumbo slice and 
        a coke for four dollars, which sounded alright to me. So, I went to sit 
        down but sitting at the only table was this cop and a family of kids that 
        were all interested in attending Columbia. They were worried about crime 
        because Columbia is kind of near Harlem. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The cop said that gentrification had taken care of a lot of the crime, 
        which I thought was a pretty funny thing to say, so I laughed out loud. 
        He gave me a look like, &quot;Hey, shut up, I'm trying to score with this 
        mom here.&quot; So I went to sit at the counter. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Full length mirrors lined the walls, which made sitting at the counter 
        a bit awkward. I kept staring at my face while eating, which is really 
        embarrassing. I had this stupid literary journal with me, so I pretended 
        to read that. Then I stared at the cop using the mirror and thought I 
        was being sly, but I guess he was a well-trained cop because he figured 
        it out and gave me another look. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the corner, this fat kid with awful blonde highlights in his hair was 
        saying, &quot;No one else thought she was hot, but I thought she was slamming!&quot; 
        I laughed because sometimes lowered expectations are funny. Then I sighed 
        because they are endearing, too. &quot;At least this boy goes to this 
        great college and will make a lot of money and then get married,&quot; 
        I thought to myself, &quot;Everyone gets married.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This thought was a consolation to me, and as if on cue this girl with 
        a long neck and pale arms sat next to me with two jumbo slices. She ate 
        her pizza with her hands and slurped her coke loudly. I was in the middle 
        of debating whether her eating habits were sexy or disgusting, when these 
        two little turds came and sat on the other side of me. They were freshmen 
        and were talking about drinking forties, but both of them were eating 
        their pizza with plastic knives and forks. Like really cutting the shit 
        up into small cubes, spearing four or five pizza cubes on their fork and 
        delicately placing the stack of cut-up pizza in their mouths. My stomach 
        churned with contempt and I tried catching the girl's eye via the mirror 
        so we could both sneer at these little puff-monkeys. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Somehow, it worked and I motioned towards the delicate eaters with my 
        eyes and she started laughing. The fat guy in the corner started talking 
        about the girl that had put the highlights in his hair, which stirred 
        up more giggling from me and this girl. I noticed that she was wearing 
        a t-shirt over a tight sweater. The t-shirt said, &quot;Provincetown&quot; 
        on it, which discouraged me at first, but then I rationalized that her 
        dad might be gay. My pizza slice was done, but I didn't want to leave, 
        so I thought about doing that move where you write your name and number 
        down on a piece of paper and drop it on their tray while leaving, but 
        I didn't because I'm not that type of person and she probably wouldn't 
        have been too impressed by the (207) prefix. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There was nothing left to do, so I got up and left and got in my car and 
        drove up to Maine. In the car, I decided that hitting on girls is stupid 
        anyway. We had our moment and there was no need to extend it any further 
        than it had gone. A small laugh shared through a mirror in a pizza parlor 
        in New York should always be enough. If I had dropped my number off and 
        she had called me, I'd either do something crazy or she'd say something 
        over the phone like, &quot;I'm really into tantra&quot; or &quot;I'm ready 
        to have babies now,&quot; or, even worse, I would have realized that our 
        entire connection was forged because both of us were being petty and judgmental. 
        Which would teach me a good lesson for trying to construct a house out 
        of mud, glorious mud.</p>
