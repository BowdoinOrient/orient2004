      <p align="left"> Perhaps it's the warmer weather bringing skimpier clothes. 
        Or maybe the sunny days give everyone a more attractive glow. In any case, 
        it seems at that at Bowdoin, romance flourishes along with the flowers 
        come springtime. The number of dates Bowdoin students go on may be inversely 
        proportional to the amount of snow on the ground. Even the birds and the 
        bees agree it's mating season. And why shouldn't there be a little more 
        love in the air at the end of school? Let's take a closer look at the 
        SPRING FLING.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Spring beneath the pines means barbecues, studying and sunbathing on the 
        quad and sloshball. It's no surprise Ivies weekend and the Gala are in 
        the spring-everyone is a little more willing to let lose and go out and 
        meet more people that they might be less likely to find otherwise. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Also, as much as we hate to admit it, the fact that school is about to 
        be over is in the back of everyone's mind. Whereas someone might be slightly 
        more cautious about getting into a relationship in October-the thought 
        of the entire year ahead may be daunting-the end of school presents a 
        respectable opt-out. Moreover, if you like a few people at the beginning 
        of the year, you might not want to put all your eggs in one basket. But 
        come April, you may have crossed some of them off the list and decide 
        that you might as well go for broke with one or two. If you make a fool 
        of yourself, you'd only have to deal with it for a few weeks anyway. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meghan is a veteran spring flinger. For two years in a row now, she has 
        been asked out by guys in mid-April and ended up having great relationships 
        with them that were far more fun, not to mention mature, than any other 
        situations she has found herself in at any other point in the school year. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I don't know what it is,&quot; she comments, &quot;but literally 
        the same week two years in row, these great guys who seemed to ignore 
        me until then suddenly decide they want to go out.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The spring fling is especially common among seniors (and for some reason, 
        found even more frequently with senior girls and under-class guys), which 
        may be due to the fact that the built-in deadline has a little more finality. 
        Knowing that they will never have to deal with the aftermath gives seniors 
        even more incentive to jump into any sort of relationship during their 
        final months at Bowdoin. For this reason, the spring fling would seem 
        to be popular with sophomores about to spend their junior year abroad. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Lars explains that as a sophomore, he wasn't as nervous to ask out Caitlin, 
        a senior, last week, because he knew the worst-case scenario would be 
        that he would get rejected and feel awkward around her for three weeks. 
        And when I spoke to Caitlin, she confided that she was more willing to 
        go out with Lars because she figured &quot;Why not? I'll be out of here 
        in less than a month any way, I might as well give it a try.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Carrie remembers, &quot;last year, I knew three sophomore guys who got 
        started going out with senior girls in the spring. And this year it's 
        already happening again! They start to date more or less right after spring 
        break, go to dinner a few times, go to the Gala together, the guy stays 
        up for Senior Week and then after graduation it's done.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As Carrie points out, spring flings are a perfect way to ensure a Gala 
        date. Not to mention guarantee a great end of the year. Things can move 
        pretty quickly in the last few weeks because there is always the choice 
        to keep going or to just end it after school is over. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It seems that in general, spring flings present an ideal situation for 
        all. There is little pressure, minimal repercussions and the potential 
        for a very positive outcome for all parties involved. And so, as you go 
        into your final few weeks of this year, I urge you to get out there and 
        ask someone out. Whether you've liked them since September or just saw 
        them in the Dance Show, just go for it-wouldn't you like to finish the 
        year on a high note?</p>
