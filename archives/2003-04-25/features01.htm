      <p align="left">In Bowdoin's ever-increasing and constant effort to increase 
        diversity on campus, this past weekend offered a unique opportunity to 
        learn more about Caribbean culture and areas of study. Bowdoin hosted 
        the first Caribbean Studies Conference titled, Borders, Boundaries and 
        the &quot;Global&quot; in Caribbean Studies. Last semester Professor Patricia 
        Saunders of the English department was awarded the Emerging Voices New 
        Directions Grant from the Ford Foundation. In her effort to increase interest 
        in Caribbean studies on campus she has used the Ford Grant to help bring 
        this conference to Bowdoin whose participants and main lecturers hailed 
        from as far away as the University of the West Indies at Barbados and 
        Trinidad, as well as Boston College and Clark University.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The conference offered a unique opportunity to the attendees, as they 
        were able to discuss current topics within their areas of interest under 
        the encompassing blanket of Caribbean studies. In addition to several 
        panels that addressed a range of issues of globalization across the natural 
        and social sciences as well as the humanities, the conference featured 
        the work of filmmaker Stephanie Black. Her two films, Life and Debt and 
        H2 Worker both explore the underbelly of the spread of globalization in 
        poorer countries in the Caribbean region. The screening of Life and Debt 
        and the live performance of MUTABARUKA, one of Jamaica's premier performance 
        poets, brought out well over 150 people who included members of the Bowdoin 
        College community, faculty from Bates College, and USM, as well as local 
        organizers and activists from the Many and One Coalition and other Maine 
        based groups. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A Q&amp;A followed the film screening where many members of the audience 
        raised questions about the moral and economic implications of current 
        International Monetary Fund (IMF) policies for poor countries like Jamaica. 
        Following the screening Stephanie Black took some time out to talk with 
        me. She addressed some of the questions raised by viewers, particularly 
        those about the contradictory narratives circulating about globalization. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        One question that arose while viewing the film was why the IMF would not 
        subsidize the local Jamaican farmers so their goods, produce and milk, 
        would be cheaper than foreign imports, as the prices are currently not 
        even competitive with foreign produce and milk. This step, seemingly small 
        would have a big impact on the Jamaican economy as they would be able 
        to decrease their imports and by supporting local businesses would keep 
        money flowing within their country. Black responded saying: &quot;The 
        IMF is concerned with trying to incorporate Jamaica into the global economy 
        but takes time for the farming industry of Jamaica. With the kinds of 
        demands on the farming sector, they can't compete because theirs is a 
        different economy based on agriculture and irrigation systems that are 
        not as updated as those in more developed countries. The IMF is placing 
        the same structural adjustment programs on every country with very little 
        regard for the specificities of each economy and society. If Jamaica could 
        export its bananas to the US we'd be eating better tasting bananas!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Black, however, does not want to paint a totally dismal picture for her 
        viewers. Instead she encouraged people in the audience to begin to write 
        government officials and to read more about IMF and World Bank history 
        so that they could better understand the motivations behind the creation 
        of these institutions and the power of G-7 nations on the economy and 
        future of poorer nation states. Black recommends the website www.lifeanddebt.org, 
        which lists organizations in which people can get involved. </p>
      <p>According to Black some of the promising sectors in the Jamaican economy 
        include ganja farming, and exporting bananas and other fruits that are 
        not available in the US. &quot;If they legalize herb, they can produce 
        ganja. There are some countries where ganja is not an illegal drug and 
        consuming it is also not illegal and so if Jamaica were to export to those 
        countries it would help their economy.&quot; Popular culture in Jamaica 
        has had a worldwide reach as exemplified by the country's reggae music, 
        specifically of musician Bob Marley. In the past decade dancehall, another 
        product of Jamaica, has gained a huge national following. Black also sees 
        the music industry as promising to the future of Jamaica, &quot;I think 
        music would be another important product that could be exported. Unfortunately 
        Jamaican music is not owned by Jamaica, all the artists are signed to 
        American labels. So the money doesn't really go back to the country to 
        the degree that it could, if the record labels were operating fully and 
        the distribution were coming to Jamaica that would be a big resource.&quot; 
        Black also sees tourism as continuing to be a big resource, &quot;but 
        it's not good for a country to depend on it because it's too vulnerable.&quot; 
        She continued saying, &quot;if they could just be allowed to export mangoes, 
        papayas, and other agricultural goods, they would have a better chance 
        of competing on the market.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a student just beginning to study and understand the complex cultural 
        diasporas of the Caribbean nations the opportunity to meet with and discuss 
        these issues first hand with scholars in the field and to discuss current 
        issues of globalization with a film maker in this field was invaluable. 
        The two documentaries, Life and Debt and H2 Worker offer a personalized 
        and politicized view of life in Jamaica not from the perspective of a 
        tourist, but that of a global citizen. The many students who have seen 
        this film ask what they can do for Jamaica and similar countries that 
        need economic assistance from the IMF. Jamaica has been struggling for 
        years with the IMF and other international economic assistance programs 
        and it appears that combined action by the countries and outside sources 
        are these countries best hope in bettering the economic policies afforded 
        them. A key factor in effecting change is creating greater awareness. 
        I would encourage students to view this film if they are interested in 
        Caribbean studies or questions of globalization. One thing is certain; 
        the propensity for change within the IMF and other global lending institutions 
        is growing and students like those at Bowdoin College have a part to play 
        in these changes.</p>
