      <p align="left">After a cutthroat 60 minutes of regulation play, the men's 
        lacrosse team moved into overtime against host Amherst College last Saturday, 
        losing 11-10 after three tense minutes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I was pleased with the Amherst game overall, except of course with 
        the outcome,&quot; said senior co-captain Jamie Nichols. &quot;We showed 
        up to play, and [we] played hard all game long. Amherst is one of the 
        best [teams] in the conference, and they came to play as well. Last Saturday 
        was just a game between two good teams, and someone had to be on the losing 
        end-unfortunately it was us.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although Amherst led the game after the first quarter, junior Ford Gurall 
        opened the game in Bowdoin's favor. &quot;The Amherst game was a battle 
        the entire 60-plus minutes,&quot; said senior co-captain Jordan Fay.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin fought Amherst ferociously in the second quarter and entered halftime 
        in a tie after senior Kyle Courtiss scored twice in succession.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the game-high scorer last Saturday, Courtiss accounted for half of 
        the Bears' points with five goals. Courtiss and Gurall each scored in 
        the third quarter, and with 15 minutes remaining, Bowdoin trailed Amherst 
        by only one goal. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Three minutes into the last quarter, first-year Connor Fitzgerald assisted 
        senior co-captain Ted Scholhamer to post Bowdoin's final goal of the day 
        and second of the quarter; however, Amherst scored once more, dragging 
        the Bears into overtime. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Amherst was a hard-fought game by both teams. We had many chances 
        to finish and put the game away before and during the overtime period, 
        but unfortunately we just didn't,&quot; said senior co-captain Micah Moreau.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Moreau, Scholhamer, and sophomore Phil Stern each scored once against 
        Amherst. Stern and Gurall also contributed one assist each, while freshman 
        Chris Eaton and Fitzgerald each assisted two goals against Amherst.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Physically, both teams were evenly matched with a slight edge toward 
        us,&quot; said Fay. &quot;Mentally, we broke down a couple times, mostly 
        because of inexperience. Inexperience is probably the biggest factor to 
        the mediocrity of this season compared to others.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Along with this inexperience is a lack of leadership,&quot; continued 
        Fay. &quot;There are only six seniors and six juniors, while there are 
        13 freshmen. This made it hard at times to keep the maturity level required 
        to be a top team in the NESCAC. [However], there is plenty of time left 
        in the season to overcome these problems, and the freshmen are getting 
        better every game.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The first years have clearly added much to the team this season. Fitzgerald 
        still leads the NESCAC in assists and has the second-highest assists-per-game 
        average.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Defensively, first-year Bryan Duggan has been a key force for Bowdoin. 
        &quot;The defensive unit this year consists of the three close defense 
        starters: Andrew O'Brien ['05], Austin Branson ['04], and myself,&quot; 
        said Fay. Goalkeeper Grant White '04, long-stick midfielder Nichols and 
        defensive midfielders Duggan, Graham Jones '04, and Alex Duncan '03 round 
        out the lineup.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Duncan, Jones, and Duggan deserve a hell of a lot more credit than 
        they receive,&quot; said Nichols. &quot;Other teams love to invert on 
        us and initiate with their midfielders, and when they do this they are 
        exposing our defensive middies and really put pressure on them to perform. 
        [Jones, Duggan, and Duncan] have responded very well to that challenge.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Duncan does everything behind the scenes for us,&quot; Nichols added. 
        &quot;He plays man down, he plays a little bit of offense, he clears the 
        ball, and he does it all very well. He's a great utility man for us-just 
        a huge factor who makes us that much better of a team all around. I don't 
        know where we would be without him.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Behind Duncan, at the heart of the defensive line, is White. In his first 
        season as a full-time goalkeeper, White has protected Bowdoin's net for 
        every minute of every game and collected a 56 percent save rate.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Grant's save percentage places him less than 1.5 percent behind the Williams, 
        Bates, and Trinity goalkeepers, and ahead of the Wesleyan goalkeeper. 
        White blocked 13 shots on net against Amherst, allowing only 11 to sneak 
        past him. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After the Amherst game, Bowdoin is ranked seventh in the NESCAC, ahead 
        of Trinity, Bates, and Colby. However, in terms of scoring offense, the 
        Bears stand in fifth place. Its average of 10.5 goals per game places 
        Bowdoin ahead of Williams, Connecticut, Colby, Trinity, and Bates.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Courtiss currently leads the NESCAC for the most goals scored this season, 
        with a cumulative 37-an average of 2.85 goals per game. Behind Courtiss, 
        Bowdoin's next highest scorers are Scholhamer and Stern, each with 16 
        goals thus far. Fitzgerald and Gurall have 14 and 12 respectively.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With 28 assists, Fitzgerald leads the Bears, followed by sophomore Vinay 
        Kashyap with nine, Courtiss and Gurall with eight assists apiece, and 
        Eaton with five this season.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With the end of the regular season only one day away, Fay looks forward 
        to the NESCAC tournament. &quot;We will definitely be a tough contender 
        in the tournament, hopefully capitalizing on our 'outside smoke.' It has 
        been a tough season because every game has been close. Usually there is 
        less parity throughout the NESCAC. This year the winner may not be the 
        better team-it will be the team that has worked for it the hardest.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears will host their last regular season game at Ryan Field tomorrow 
        against Trinity.</p>
