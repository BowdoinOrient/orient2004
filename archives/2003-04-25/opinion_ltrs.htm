      <p align="left"> To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>There are many wonderful and traditional year-end events that the Dining 
        Service staff are planning and looking forward to, such as the All Sports 
        Banquet, College House events, and numerous Commencement meals and receptions. 
        I'm sorry to say that one event we are not looking forward to is Ivies 
        Weekend!</p>
      <p>Staff memories from last year linger and fill those who are scheduled 
        to work with a sense of dread. The boisterous and disrespectful behavior 
        of inebriated revelers made the dining halls extremely uncomfortable for 
        other students and the staff who were forced to deal with it. Although 
        we want you to have a good time enjoying the short and late-arriving spring, 
        we hope that your fun is not going to be at the expense of other diners 
        and staff who work so hard all year to serve you.</p>
      <p>We wish you a fun and safe Ivies Weekend, and thank you in advance for 
        respecting others and maintaining appropriate behavior in the dining halls. 
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Intramural athletes losing out</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I write to you as a concerned Bowdoin student. I am a senior, and in 
        my four years at Bowdoin, I have had the great of honor of partaking in 
        Bowdoin's Intramural Athletics Program. Unfortunately this letter is written 
        in a somber tone that is meant to reflect the sadness that I have experienced 
        this year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        During this academic year, I have witnessed the IM empire erected and 
        maintained by Dave Mountcastle, Kris Hopkins, and Bobby Surdell fall apart. 
        The new IM director has had some issues finding a comfort zone and growing 
        into the position. During the Soccer season teams' records were improperly 
        tabulated, unfairly forcing certain teams from playoff spots that they 
        had rightfully earned. During the basketball seasons, playing basketball 
        was the exception and waiting for your team's next game was the rule. 
        Teams only played four or five games (in previous years teams were guaranteed 
        upwards of six games in the regular season), some teams never received 
        schedules, the 3-on-3 playoff bracket was organized in a non-sensical 
        fashion (the number one seed played the number two seed in the first round!), 
        and games were awkwardly scheduled (some teams would play two games in 
        one week and then be forced to sit idle for three weeks). As you can imagine, 
        this discombobulating situation disoriented players and harmed their precious 
        rhythm and intuitive sense of timing. During the softball season, things 
        have been equally frustrating. Surely, inclement weather is partially 
        at fault for the mix-ups, but canceling softball games that were scheduled 
        for 4:15 p.m. at 4:08 p.m. is unprofessional. Forgetting to send monitors 
        to the fields is inexcusable. Teams have been left stranded at the fields 
        without bats, balls, or bases. Why is this happening? </p>
      <p align="left">
        All of these mistakes could have been easily avoided had the new IM director 
        paid closer attention to detail, showed an active interest in the games, 
        and adhered to the tried-and-true methods employed by the previous IM 
        Tsar. As I leave Bowdoin, I hope that these slip-ups can be remedied for 
        future generations of Bowdoin students. If action is not taken to correct 
        these egregious errors, I would encourage the students to organize a grassroots 
        movement in order to agitate for substantive change and the return of 
        the illustrious Dave Mountcastle, or at least Pat Hultgren. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Why complain?</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I am writing in response to the slew of pedantic articles and letters 
        that have popped up in the last few weeks. From complaints about bestial 
        conversational skills to the overall &quot;rowdiness&quot; of the Bowdoin 
        College community, pretentious and introverted, complainers seem to have 
        come out of the very woodwork lately. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Introverts are great, don't get me wrong-I consider myself a chronic introvert-but, 
        in this case, I cannot take their side. Here's why. Otherness-whether 
        it involves the possession of conversational skills or the ability to 
        enjoy Plato, or Milton, or Nietzsche-is a beautiful thing. However, you 
        can't have otherness without a lot of common clay of the earth, i.e. morons. 
        That's right, folks, I am talking about stupid people, i.e. passive individuals. 
        I guess Genevieve Creedon didn't realize it, but most places she goes 
        she'll find them.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This segment of the population is analogous to the wall space that surrounds 
        a piece of great artwork or the line of dancers that backs up Fred Astaire 
        and Ginger Rogers in that big number at the end of Shall We Dance*. You 
        don't focus on them and they are not meant to be the focus of attention, 
        but without them, the main attraction is nothing. Since the phrase &quot;stupid 
        people&quot; may be somewhat misleading and derogatory, I'll give these 
        people another designation: scaena (Latin for stage, natural background, 
        or the public eye), scas for short.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Scas are an ancient, time-honored segment of any population and have been 
        around since the creation of man. In addition, Scas are not a static part 
        of the population-their designation floats, wanders. Everyone is a sca 
        at one point or another. Everyone has to be-even, and perhaps most importantly, 
        the ones who are destined or determined to be the painting on the wall. 
        Without some time in the gutter-either observing/sympathizing with or 
        actually participating in raw, unadulterated life-a person becomes a purely 
        historical being. Quite frankly, this way of life leads to unproductive 
        misery and, even worse, creative stagnation. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So, why hate scas or try to make them change? They never will, or, at 
        least, I hope they never will. If they do, where would the &quot;other&quot; 
        go? Who would be different? Who would be unique? I'll tell you who: no 
        one. Scas are an integral part of the cycle of otherness that occurs along 
        the historical continuum of human existence. Scas are the beginning and 
        the end of human productivity, the alpha and the omega. Anyone who thinks 
        otherwise is a fool. More importantly, anyone who thinks otherwise is 
        surrendering a vital part of his/her humanity.</p>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="4"></a>Kushner's uncompromising stance</font><font size="5"></font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> I was one of the people who was less than thrilled with Tony Kushner's 
        speech last week, and my opposition was based on more than duck-like &quot;buck 
        buck buck&quot; as Sarah Ramey would have it, according to her article 
        in last week's <i>Orient</i> (&quot;A circus of inane discussion&quot;).</p>
      <p align="left">
        My main problem with Kushner, in fact, was exactly what Ramey liked about 
        him. She said that he was &quot;impassioned and uncompromising.&quot; 
        I fully agree that he was both of those. The problem is, when one is uncompromising, 
        one is also polarizing and offensive. To wit: he said he could see no 
        reasoning for invading Iraq. Whether you agree or disagree with his position 
        is irrelevant. The issue is whether one could have an intelligent debate 
        with him, in the hopes of coming to a better understanding, and, eventually, 
        a resolution. When Kushner says they can see no rationale for a given 
        position, then one either agrees or disagrees with him, and there is no 
        room for discourse, no room for compromise, and the level of debate becomes 
        little more than shouting, as was evidenced by the some of the crowd's 
        reaction at Kushner's night.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kushner further proved how polarizing, and, to some extent, ignorant he 
        was when he said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is &quot;an easy 
        issue to solve.&quot; Never mind that his proposed solution, a bi-state 
        system with easy Arab access to Jerusalem was already proposed by Israel 
        and rejected by Yasir Arafat. What is more offensive is that fact that 
        Kushner had the audacity to claim that one of the most difficult issues 
        facing the Middle East, an issue that has consumed scholars, from Morris 
        to Teveth to Khalidi, with far more information than Kushner and still 
        has not been solved, was &quot;easy&quot; to deal with. This kind of polarizing 
        statement accomplishes nothing but anger and a low level of discourse, 
        which, I believe, was Ramey's primary complaint about the Bowdoin campus.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
