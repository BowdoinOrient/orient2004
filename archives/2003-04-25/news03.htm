      <p align="left">Plates for Peace, a campus group that formed as a result 
        of the growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq hosted their first event April 
        18 in Ladd House. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The members of Plates for Peace, all formerly a part of the Bowdoin Coalition 
        Against the War in Iraq, thought its activity this past Thursday was a 
        perfect way to channel the activism that is still prevalent on campus 
        as a result of the crisis in the Middle East. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Alex Nosnik '03 led Plates for Peace in their dinner at Ladd House Thursday 
        evening. &quot;It was great because it represents a perfect confluence 
        of my passions: cooking and activism.&quot; The event arose after the 
        group of students had reviewed some of the options for fundraising. They 
        soon &quot;stumbled into the ideas of re-opening Your Restaurant, a student 
        chartered and operated restaurant that existed in Ladd House, during the 
        spring of 2002. We simply had to add a humanitarian flare.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nosnik noted that Plates for Peace represented the perfect metaphor for 
        cultural </p>
      <p align="left">
        exchange, social education, and humanitarian fundraising. While &quot;donating 
        all proceeds (stemming entirely from the mandatory $10-$30 donation) to 
        OXFAM disaster relief in Iraq&#133;we simultaneously celebrated life, 
        through the delicious and beautiful cultural education of Middle Eastern 
        poetry, food, and music, and therefore overcame the blanket of helplessness 
        that so readily plagues the active and liberal thinker.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nosnik went on to say that &quot;as a group, we aim to proliferate awareness 
        regarding the manners in which our lives, both as individuals, and as 
        a unified, American community, impact the rest of the world.&quot; The 
        group will aim to illustrate the ways in which the globalized community 
        affects the livelihood and conditions of people around the world. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Specifically, the group has &quot;unified&#133;behind the singular focus 
        of the war in Iraq, by means of a common thread of necessity, interest, 
        and support that has surfaced in light of an American, pre-emtive, unilateral 
        strike.&quot; The group began as a number of students who openly opposed 
        the action and &quot;attempted to organize a series of events in support 
        of this cause, beginning with the &quot;Event About the War In Iraq,&quot; 
        last November, followed by a massive signature campaign geared towards 
        passing a resolution condemning pre-emptive strike.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The group has, however, experienced some difficulty in combating the rampant 
        apathy that seems to have free-reign over many Bowdoin students. Nosnik 
        commented that &quot;as people with a non-mainstream social and political 
        agenda, we often times find it quite difficult to engender a means to 
        project and enliven our agenda. As of late, it appears as if the only 
        manner in which to elicit a massive, meaningful political and social action, 
        rests in the casting of one's vote.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Unfortunately, being witnesses to what some call outrageous decisions 
        on the part of the American government, many members of Plates for Peace 
        do not yet fully trust the administration. Consequently, they have determined 
        that the only solution for the time being is to &quot;take the burden 
        upon ourselves.&quot; To this end, the group has worked &quot;to develop 
        a pragmatic infrastructure by which our message can be spread and an economic 
        power might be accrued.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        This decision has resulted in several recent developments. First, &quot;As 
        a group, we hope continue linking arms with HELP, the Democratic Socialists, 
        and other progressive and environmental groups on campus, as to actively 
        promote a constant presence of </p>
      <p align="left">
        dynamic and progressive discussions on campus.&quot; Since Craig Kielburger's 
        lecture, Nosnik noted a reawakening of determination among liberal activists. 
        Nosnik noted that &quot;literally 50 students became impassioned with 
        the charge to devote themselves, selflessly, and simply act, not debate, 
        to make a difference.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;More than drawing the distinction between political and social work, 
        I feel we are trying to bridge the divide, by offering a means by which 
        we might become socially educated and concurrently politically (or socially) 
        active.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;As a community with such a rich array of perspectives, in addition 
        to educative and financial means, we need to rise above our political, 
        or even class divides, and join one another as human beings, who no matter 
        how superficially divided, are as interconnected as those billions of 
        intricate knots of a Persian rug. We would also like to add that none 
        of these events would have been possible without the kindness and generosity 
        of Craig Bradley, in the Dean's office, and Bob Graves and Alice Hershey, 
        in Residential Life, in addition to the folks at Dining Services.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        In terms of future plans the group intends on hosting another Plates for 
        Peace on Thursday, May 1. Contact anosnik@bowdoin.edu for reservations. 
        Additionally, the group will be hosting a contra dance for peace, this 
        Friday, April 25, in Sargent Gym from 7:30 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.. </p>
