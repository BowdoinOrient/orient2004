        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Recently, I watched a speech by Robert Edgar, president 
        of the National Council of Churches. His talk centered on U.S. foreign 
        policy, and his arguments were more liberal than mine. However, in thinking 
        about his positions, it dawned on me the importance that listening and 
        respect have in politics. Respect can lead to understanding and perhaps, 
        when appropriate, compromise. The ability to listen, appreciate, and learn 
        from disparate arguments is one of the most compelling legacies of a liberal 
        arts education. It is essential that we use it against tendencies of demonization 
        in today's politics.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Late on Friday night, I happened to hit C-SPAN before I went to bed and 
        picked up Edgar's speech to the Joan Kroch Institute in San Diego, California. 
        His talk focused mostly on the Council's negative response to the war 
        in Iraq. During the question period, someone asked him how he would shape 
        American foreign policy if he were president. His answer was profound 
        in both its genuineness and its liberality. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He readily admitted that America is the only superpower today. However, 
        he took that classification in an entirely different direction than our 
        current president. Edgar said that as a superpower we have a responsibility 
        to fix our own problems here at home before we gallivant across the globe 
        in the name of democracy. He cited the number of Americans without adequate 
        health care, education, and housing as examples of what needed to be accomplished 
        here at home before we could justify propagating democracy to other countries. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The reflexive reaction of many liberals to Edgar's rhetoric is to embrace 
        it wholly and demonize those that disagree as &quot;cold hearted,&quot; 
        &quot;elitist,&quot; or the particularly vitriolic &quot;fascist&quot; 
        and &quot;racist.&quot; These names only foment anger and shut off debate. 
        Political name-calling reminds me of what my grandfather told me when 
        I was younger about swearing. He said that when he served in the army 
        in World War II, his unit's chaplain spoke to the men about using curse 
        words. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The chaplain preached that swearing insults one's intelligence. Swearing 
        shows that one is not intelligent enough to think of a more appropriate 
        word. Just as it demonstrates a lack of intelligence to swear, to dismiss 
        an argument with a mere label displays a lack of thought. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact is that there is an honorable argument against delaying military 
        action until all of our domestic social problems are solved. Those that 
        disagree with Edgar's desire for increased social spending likely believe 
        that the tax increase required for such an upsurge in social spending 
        will hinder economic growth. They also believe that the national government's 
        primary role is self-defense and that states should concern themselves 
        with the millions of Americans who lack health care. These are decent 
        arguments that deserve a substantive rebuttal and not epithets.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Both sides of the political spectrum are guilty of this sort of demonization. 
        The right has an unfortunate tendency to brandish many people who utter 
        comments against the war on terrorism as being &quot;unpatriotic.&quot; 
        The paradigmatic moment of this phenomenon was the infamous instance in 
        December of 2001 when Attorney General John Ashcroft informed the Senate 
        Judiciary Committee that those who questioned his aggressive anti-terrorism 
        law enforcement were &quot;only helping those that would attack this nation.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Putting aside the merits of Ashcroft's ideas for a moment, I repudiate 
        prima facie* the notion that those who question Ashcroft are &quot;unpatriotic.&quot; 
        Thinking about our own justification for going to war in Iraq should help 
        explain why: One of the principal values of a republican democracy is 
        the right to express one's opinions freely. Therefore, it is wholly hypocritical 
        to accuse someone of being unpatriotic while we as a country are fighting 
        to allow citizens of another country to express themselves freely. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ashcroft's ranting disrespected legitimate concerns: Wanting to retard 
        a Justice Department that was detaining people without charges, denying 
        them attorneys, and wanting to increase its powers beyond any previously 
        acceptable level is an honorable attempt to protect constitutional rights 
        and deserves substantive explanations rather than a Manichean diatribe. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin is a far more ideologically diverse place now than it was four 
        years ago. The impassioned debate before the BSG last month about the 
        merits of the anti-war resolution and the proliferation of political publications 
        on campus over the last two years are ample pieces of evidence of this 
        increase in political awareness and activism. Diversity of ideas allows 
        one to see the merits of an argument and penetrate beneath the surface 
        of the banal sound bites that one hears too frequently. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Interest in or engagement of political ideas may be harder to find in 
        the &quot;real world.&quot; However, I hope that all of us who love politics: 
        liberals, conservatives, and those who defy definition, can retain our 
        zeal for ideas and encourage our colleagues to see those with differing 
        opinions as people and not pejorative names. Judging by today's tendencies 
        toward demonization, increasing bipartisan respect among the body politic 
        would be real political progress. </p>
