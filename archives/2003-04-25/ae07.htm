      <p align="left">The plays ranged from tear-stained to irreverently flippant 
        to bittersweet. Audience members were confronted with a range of emotions 
        from melancholy to amusement. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The first play entailed the examination of three crestfallen characters, 
        each locked in their own rooms-i.e. locked in their own psychologically 
        disastrous life experiences. Written by Sam Cohan '05, Static addressed 
        the walls and boundaries that we all must overcome in order to live well. 
        As one character, whose wife had perished during childbirth, said, &quot;you 
        can't just sit around watching static on T.V., you have to get up&#133;&quot; 
        and change the channel.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Cohan noted, &quot;I think, somewhere, you'll find those character voices 
        inside my head, bopping about.&quot; Indeed, none doubted that the characters 
        were indeed bopping about in the young playwright's head. Consequently 
        they bopped out of his head and onto stage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It is true that the three characters began with fresh stories-a man who 
        had lost his wife, a girl who had given birth at a prom and killed her 
        progeny, and a youth whose father had drank himself to death. Kudos to 
        the three fine actors who put their energies into the parts. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Odds Up, by Mike Harding '03, the second play presented, centered itself 
        around the enormous energy that Chris McCabe '05 and James Nylund '06 
        were able to bring to their parts as sports betters. The storyline examined 
        the mysticism and superstition that surround the phenomenon of sports 
        bets-the lucky charms, the lucky gestures, and the lucky breaks. Harding 
        commented that all the guys who bet on sports &quot;have all this information 
        about certain teams and it makes them think they can win easily.&quot; 
        The play had a delightful mix of slapstick humor and male desperation 
        that kept the energy high and the laughs plentiful.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sophomore Scott Raker's play After Image also took the stage, lending 
        somber, self-pitying, tones to what had so recently been a scene of harmless 
        merriment. Raker based the play on the Bob Dylan album Blood on the Tracks. 
        Raker examined the ways in which fragments of past love remain reflected 
        in the memory. Playing with representations of love-from the sounds of 
        lip-smacks to the memory of touch-Raker attempted to recount one man's 
        journey in and out of love. The man's history revealed that he had only 
        run into &quot;sparks&quot; and never the full-fledged explosion of love. 
        Like a lost mole searching for the light at the end of the tunnel, the 
        man ultimately found himself still in the dark.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The last play, Disconnect, by Cohan, was the crown jewel of the night. 
        Bittersweet and with a delightful mix of comedy and cutting wit, Disconnect 
        was blessed with savvy actors and a practically flawless script. Ben Botwick 
        '06, who played the narrator James, carried the show with a conglomeration 
        of flippancy and subtle melancholy that was utterly endearing. By recounting 
        the adventures of a typical college weekend outing, Cohan examined the 
        idea that students tend to substitute single nights of pleasure for love. 
        Unfortunately, as Cohan notes in the play, the pleasure hardly lasts until 
        morning and ultimately amounts to a cumbersome form of masturbation. The 
        repercussions are hardly worth the trouble. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The one acts were written and performed by Bowdoin students and were sponsored 
        by Masque and Gown. This year marked the 67th annual performance of the 
        student written one act festival.</p>
