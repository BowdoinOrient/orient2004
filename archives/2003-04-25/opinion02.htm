        <font size="2">CHRISTIAN POTHOLM</font><font size="2"><br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> One of the great delights of democracy is the cacophony 
        when everyone has her or his say. One of the great banes of our present 
        democracy is that every TV channel and radio station now feels a need 
        to fill every day and night with talking-head chatter, no matter how ill 
        informed.<br>
        The second Gulf War produced an unprecedented tidal wave of pontification 
        and punditry. Many observations proved to be unhelpful to viewers and 
        listeners and often, just plain wrong. Here is just a smattering of the 
        imagined &quot;horribles,&quot; the worst-case assumptions put forward:</p>
      <p> (1) Saddam Hussein's regime is extremely tough and will put up a very 
        strong fight. Actually, the regime collapsed like rotten snow fort in 
        the blazing sun. In less than three week's time!</p>
      <p> (2) The United States will suffer enormous casualties. Actually, the 
        United States suffered fewer casualties in the war of 2003 than in the 
        Gulf War of 1991.</p>
      <p> (3) The Iraqi people will suffer enormous casualties. Actually, the 
        civilian and indeed the military population of Iraq suffered fewer casualties 
        than in the Gulf War of 1991.</p>
      <p> (4) The nationalism of the Iraqi people will drive them to fiercely 
        resist the &quot;foreign invasion.&quot; Actually, most of the Iraqi people 
        welcomed the overthrow of Saddam with a vengeance which surprised even 
        Al-Jazera. </p>
      <p> (5) The &quot;Arab street&quot; will rise up as one against the U.S. 
        invasion and set the world ablaze. As it has in the past, the Arab street 
        fizzled out after a few days. I must say that the capacity of some of 
        the Arab street for self-pity and delusion is truly extraordinary. How 
        pathetic a warrior culture when the likes of Saddam Hussein, having killed 
        more Moslems than any person in history, is held up as a hero. How pathetic 
        a warrior culture that is reduced to venerating suicide attacks by coerced 
        pregnant women.</p>
      <p> I should say parenthetically that I was one of the earliest supporters 
        of an independent Palestinian state and indeed brought the first PLO spokesperson 
        to Bowdoin in the 1970s. And I have always opposed the construction of 
        Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. </p>
      <p>But much of the Arab street seems to think that suffering is a prerogative 
        only of the Palestinian people. Much of the Arab street simply opposes 
        the continued existence of Israel under any circumstances. It is therefore 
        impossible to make peace with that segment of the population. As long 
        as the United States supports Israel's right to exist, there will be widespread 
        and strong opposition to U.S., no matter what else we do. There is no 
        way around this aspect.</p>
      <p> (6) There will be a wave of terrorist attacks on U.S. targets all over 
        the world. There was one thwarted bomb attack on a McDonald's in Lebanon. 
        Of course, attacks could still come, but it is impossible to argue at 
        this juncture that the U.S. invasion of Iraq prompted contemporary widespread 
        terror attacks.</p>
      <p> (7) The war against Iraq will cost trillions of dollars. I actually 
        heard one commentator say that it could cost more than World War II! To 
        date we've spent $20 billion. World War II coast $2.9 trillion. $20 billion 
        is nothing to sneeze at - except in comparison to the costs of trying 
        to secure the U.S. homeland. As I have written before, there is not enough 
        money in the whole world to accomplish that, so it is cost effective to 
        project power to where the terrorists are, rather than wait for them to 
        come to us and then take action.</p>
      <p> (8) There will be widespread terror attacks against the U.S. homeland. 
        There were none.</p>
      <p> (9) The U.S. will get bogged down in a major land war and will have 
        to slog it out on the ground. The U.S. military set a world record for 
        speed and distance and reached Baghdad within a few days. It was the longest, 
        fastest blitzkrieg in history. Velocity trumped mass.</p>
      <p> (10) Saddam's regime will attack Israel and coalition forces with chemical 
        and biological weapons. Special forces and air attacks, plus the rapid 
        advance of land forces, overran any Iraqi capacity to do this. Indeed, 
        one of the under-reported benefits of the war just conducted was that 
        the Iraqi leadership was so busy moving, hiding and destroying its weapons 
        of mass destruction as we rapidly approached that it couldn't use them.</p>
      <p> (11) Saddam's regime will set the oil fields on fire and will<br>
        cause a huge disruption of the world's oil supplies. U.S. forces prevented 
        the destruction of the oil fields all over Iraq. Of over 2000 oil wells, 
        less than a dozen were set on fire and all are now out.</p>
      <p> And so it went. One by one, the imaginary horribles failed to occur 
        as the Coalition, using small group cohesion, superior technology, superb 
        command and control and a brilliant battle plan, challenged centuries 
        old fundamentals of warfare.</p>
      <p> This does not mean, of course, that nay-sayers will always be wrong 
        and that none of their imaginary horribles will ever come to pass during 
        some future phase of this ongoing war. But it does mean, categorically 
        and unequivocally, that they were very, very wrong about this phase.</p>
      <p> Two final observations: </p>
      <p>First, the level of questions asked by many of the reporters covering 
        this war was abysmally superficial and herd-driven. Most seemed to have 
        no understanding of military action and exhibited the same desire for 
        instant gratification on all fronts at all times which I find so na&iuml;ve 
        in major segments of the American population. As a society, we simply 
        need to insist that those reporters who cover military actions have some 
        modicum of understanding about the nature of war and have some historical 
        reference framework into which to put their instant analysis. </p>
      <p>Second, I continue to believe that the United States has been forced-against 
        its will-into a decades long struggle with terrorism all over the world. 
        Once having been engaged, we cannot wish it away with platitudes or pandering 
        to those who wish our destruction. Iraq is only one battle in a continuing 
        war that has a long, long way to run. </p>
      <p>This ongoing war will outlast the second Bush administration and others 
        to come. We'd all better get used to it.</p>
