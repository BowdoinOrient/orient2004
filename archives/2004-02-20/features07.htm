      <p align="left"><font size="5">Homeless helped: Students fight poverty in Maine</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">CAITLIN MACDONALD<br>CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>      <p align="left">This week marks the beginning of Raise Your Voice: A Month of Action, a month-long initiative sponsored by Campus Compact to celebrate and increase civic engagement efforts on college campuses throughout the nation.</p>
<p align="left">Here in Maine, members of the Maine Campus Compact Student Leadership team, a group made up of student representatives from 19 colleges and universities throughout the state, are organizing projects on their campuses around the issue of hunger and homelessness in this state.</p>
<p align="left">As Bowdoin representative Joel Presti '06 remarked, "We considered a lot of different social problems to focus on, but everybody in the group was concerned about hunger issues in Maine. It is an issue that we felt we could directly combat in tangible ways right in our own communities."</p>
<p align="left">To kick off this Month of Action Jess Koski '05 is launching a new project known as Hats for the Homeless, which aims to provide winter hats to people who are experiencing homelessness here in Brunswick and throughout Maine. The project, modeled after a similar one at Princeton University, provides an opportunity for novice knitters to learn the art from more experienced knitters while making an important contribution to those in need during the cold winter months. All materials and instruction is provided free of charge to knitters who agree to donate their first completed hats. </p>
<p align="left">Quinby House is sponsoring the project by donating yarns and needles to get the program up and running and providing a space for knitters to meet each week. Knitters of all skill levels are encouraged to get involved by attending the weekly sessions that will be held in the common room of Quinby on Sunday afternoons starting the first week in March. To learn more about the project, would-be knitters can get a sneak peak on Monday when Koski and fellow knitters take over the Union to spread the word about this new student group.</p>
<p align="left">Hats for the Homeless is not the first student initiative here at Bowdoin aimed at alleviating the problems associated with poverty. For years, Bowdoin students have been volunteering their time at the Tedford Shelter and the Tedford Family Shelter every night of the week. The Tedford Shelter, located right in downtown Brunswick, serves individuals over the age of 18 who are in need of temporary emergency housing.</p>
<p align="left">Volunteers, like coordinators Presti and Matt Thomson '06, serve meals, socialize with residents, and help with day-to-day tasks around the shelter. An affiliate of the Tedford Shelter, The Tedford Family Shelter is a temporary place for homeless families with children, located just a short walk from campus on Federal Street, where volunteers read to children and organize arts and crafts activities.  </p>
<p align="left">The campus chapter of Habitat for Humanity is another student group dedicated to fighting poverty here in Maine. They seek to provide affordable, adequate housing in the Bath and Brunswick communities by building with the local Habitat affiliate 3 days each semester. Volunteers work side by side with future homeowners during every phase of construction of the new home.</p>
<p align="left">At the end of March, Bowdoin Habitat will be sponsoring a weeklong event called "Habifest2004" to increase awareness about their mission and raise money to support their efforts. Their plans include bringing speakers to Bowdoin to discuss hunger, homelessness, poverty, and housing issues, and sponsoring a pub night or campus-wide party, with all proceeds going to support Habitat for Humanity. The group is also organizing a postcard and letter-writing campaign to encourage Congress to support funding for affordable housing programs in the United States.</p>
<p align="left">The group will also begin a building project this year through Habitat International's Youth United Program. According to campus coordinator Jen Horwitz '04, "The goal is to bring youth, ages five to 25, together to build a house. We will be building in the Brunswick community and serving as build leaders and mentoring several high school and middle school groups on how to create their own chapters, organize build teams, fundraise, and form committees to lead their projects."  </p>
<p align="left">Today's Common Hour is also devoted to the issue of hunger and homelessness with guest Liz Murray, who will share her story "Homeless to Harvard-A Remarkable Journey" in Morrell Lounge of Smith Union at 12:30 p.m.</p>
<p align="left">In the past year, over 3,000,000 men, women, and children were homeless. For many poor families, one missed paycheck or expensive medical bill can push them into homelessness. Currently, Maine leads the country with the fastest-growing poverty rate, tied with Arkansas and Mississippi, and there are people experiencing homelessness, hunger, and poverty right here in Brunswick. To find out how to get involved with these and other poverty fighting organizations, drop by the Community Service Resource Center.</p>
