      <p align="left">After attaining 16 wins and suffering eight losses (6-3 in NESCAC play), the fourth-seed Bowdoin Men's Basketball Team clinched a first-round NESCAC home game with a season ending victory over Colby. The team defeated the Mules 84-70 and will host fifth-seed Bates College tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p align="left">On Valentine's Day, Morrell Gymnasium was filled with love, energy, and excitement for what was the final regular season game for the Polar Bears. Bowdoin also honored its two co-captains, T.J. McLeod '04 and Jonathan Farmer '03, in commemoration of Senior Day. </p>
<p align="left">Coach Tim Gilbride said that the energy level and intensity of this game was like no other. "Although we go through the same routine and hold the same expectations for every game, there was definitely a compelling force that drove our emotions over the top entering this contest," he said.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin came out fired up and rushed to a 10-2 lead at the start of the game. The team dominated the scoring in the first half after a three-pointer from Sean Walker '05 at the ten-minute mark extended the lead to 14 points. The Polar Bears shot over 50 percent from the field in the first half and entered the break ahead 45-31.</p>
<p align="left">The men had a rough start in the second half and allowed Colby to cut the lead to just 11 points with just over ten minutes remaining. The Polar Bears then began a decisive 13-2 run that was sparked by a pair of three-point bombs from Kevin Bradley '07, and they never looked back. With approximately four minutes left to play, Gilbride made substitutions for his two seniors to grant them salutations from teammates, coaches, and fans.</p>
<p align="left">Bradley ended the contest with 17 points and six assists, and was responsible for sending two Mules to the ground with And-1-Mix-tape style crossovers. "I told my top boy, Antwan, that I was going to put on a show because the gym was packed so I tried my best to do so and the game went well," said Bradley. Bradley has had much success in his first season as a member and starting point guard of the squad but says that his season will not be complete until they destroy Bates tomorrow and win the NESCAC.</p>
<p align="left">Kyle Petrie '06, who has also had an outstanding season, played his most complete game of basketball in this competition, filling every stat category with 17 points, 12 rebounds, four steals and three assists.</p>
<p align="left">McLeod led all scorers with 20 points on his special day, while Mark Yakavonis '05 had 14. "Before the game I was overwhelmed with the thought of my collegiate basketball career nearing its end," said McLeod. "Knowing that a victory over the White Mules would ensure another opportunity to play in front of the best fans in the NESCAC provided me with extra incentive to win." </p>
<p align="left">The team was honored to have the great Michael Harding '03, a.k.a. "Hard Mike," in attendance at the game. Harding is recognized in the history of Bowdoin basketball as a squarish-roundish crafty veteran. Braden Clement '03 was also present. Although the season has not come to a complete end, the team is pleased with its performance during the regular season but, like any great competitor, know that there is still room for improvement. </p>
<p align="left">"My goals for the team at the beginning of the season were to develop and implement good work ethics, and to physically and mentally prepare the guys for intense competition," said Coach Gilbride. "Our goals have expanded as the season moved along and we've done a better job of reaching them on each step of the way."</p>
<p align="left">Coach Gilbride attributes a significant portion of the team's success to its two seniors. "I feel that a team takes on the characteristics and qualities of its captains," he said. Gilbride said that Farmer's seriousness on and off the court has helped the team become a more mature group and has also raised the team's competitive edge. "Jon always comes prepared to play hard and he takes pride in doing so. I think that his return to this year's team has brought back some experience and leadership that we lost in last year's seniors." Farmer has also brought back a huge defensive presence for the Polar Bears. </p>
<p align="left">Coach Gilbride said that McLeod shows great passion and enthusiasm for the game of basketball, and he imparts this attitude onto his teammates.  "Well, what can I say about T.J.," Gilbride said. "To me, T.J. is a coach on the court and his love for the game allows him to do just that. One of the keen aspects of T.J.'s game is that he thrives for the big time moments, he wants to make the big play and he wants to be the aggressor." </p>
<p align="left">Gilbride added that having a veteran player such as McLeod, who is willing to take on such responsibilities, is all a coach can ask for. "T.J.'s endless display of composure takes a lot of pressure off of the other guys on the team, most of whom are younger than him." The presences of these two gentlemen will be missed as they enter the world to take on more prosperous endeavors.</p>
<p align="left">Be sure to attend tomorrow's game at Bowdoin at 4:00 p.m. to support McLeod and Farmer in their efforts to lead their team to another victory and advance to the NESCAC semi-finals.</p>
