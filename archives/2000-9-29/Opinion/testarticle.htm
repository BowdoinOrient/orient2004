        Airlines Jet Used Wrong Runway </font></b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;<font size="2">&nbsp;TAIPEI, 
        Taiwan -Singapore Airlines acknowledged Friday the pilot of a 747 that 
        crashed on takeoff and killed 81 people had brought the plane down the 
        wrong runway, and accepted responsibility for the accident. The runway 
        in question, adjacent and parallel to the intended path, was closed for 
        construction and littered with concrete blocks and heavy equipment at 
        the time of the accident. It was also lit, though it was not supposed 
        to be, which could have made a pilot error easier to occur in the dim 
        visibility. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Officials 
        said they were trying to determine whether the runway was lit by mistake. 
        Singapore Airlines had denied until a statement issued Friday evening 
        that its pilot made any error. It came to a new conclusion after hearing 
        evidence collected by Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council. ``As unlikely 
        as it seemed at first, the plane was on the wrong runway,'' said the airline's 
        deputy chairman and chief executive, Cheong Choong Kong. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;``We accept 
        this finding,'' he said. ``It is critical that we understand exactly what 
        happened and precisely what made the cockpit crew believe that they were 
        on the correct runway,'' he said. At a separate news conference, he told 
        reporters: ``They are our pilots. That was our aircraft. The aircraft 
        should not be on that runway. We accept full responsibility,'' the Reuters 
        news agency quoted him as saying. The pilot, who survived, said he had 
        seen an object in front of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet just before lifting 
        off and tried to avoid it but could not. The jet, carrying 159 passengers 
        and 20 crew members, veered to the side, split into three pieces and burst 
        into flames. At a news conference earlier Friday, Kay Yong, managing director 
        of the Aviation Safety Council, said the pilot had not been sent to the 
        wrong runway by the control tower, and believed he was on the correct 
        one, according to The Associated Press. But he said it was too early in 
        the investigation to conclude that the pilot was responsible for the crash. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;A day 
        earlier, Mr. Yong said it appeared the aircraft had been traveling straight 
        ahead when it first made impact. And he confirmed that concrete blocks 
        on the closed runway were hit by the plane. Earth excavators at the site 
        were also mangled, but it was not yet clear at what point in the crash 
        they were hit. Despite the fierce winds and poor visibility at the time 
        of the crash, officials are adamant that the weather conditions at the 
        airport met guidelines for takeoff. On Thursday, the death toll rose to 
        81 as two more severely burned victims died. At least 24 of the dead were 
        Americans. Relatives of foreign victims continued to arrive in Taipei 
        to undertake the grim task of identifying remains. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The bodies 
        were moved Thursday evening from a makeshift morgue at the airport to 
        a nearby county morgue. But many were too badly burned for identification 
        and officials were taking blood samples from relatives to assist in DNA 
        analysis. Thursday night, experts from the United States Federal Aviation 
        Administration and National Transportation Safety Board were meeting with 
        officials from Taiwan, Singapore and Boeing and from Pratt & Whitney, 
        the engine maker, to examine the evidence on the crash.</font></p>
