      <p align="left"><font size="5">A conversation with Doug Jehl</font><br>
        <font size="2">ALEX DUNCAN<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Doug Jehl has worked for </i>The New York Times<i> in 
        a variety of capacities, including bureau chief in Cairo, Egypt, and as 
        an environmental correspondent out of Washington, D.C. As the world's 
        attention focused on Afghanistan and its neighbors in the wake of September 
        11, the </i>Times<i> sent him to the region (which he covered prior to 
        his assignment in Washington), and he has subsequently spent five of the 
        last six months in the area. He reported from the USS Enterprise (an aircraft 
        carrier in the Arabian Sea that served as a launching point for attacks 
        into Afghanistan), and from Saudi Arabia. He briefly returned home to 
        his wife, Lisa, and their one-year-old daughter, Nicole, for Christmas 
        in Bethesda, Maryland, before duty called him back overseas. In recent 
        weeks he has been in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he is currently serving 
        as acting Islamabad bureau chief. It is from Pakistan that Doug, my cousin, 
        agreed to answer questions via e-mail, regarding the kidnapping and murder 
        of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. </i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Did you know Daniel Pearl? What was he like?</b><br>
        I did know Danny. I first met him 20 years ago, when he was a year behind 
        me at Stanford. I didn't know him well then, but our paths crossed over 
        the years in places like Iran when we were both covering the Middle East-he 
        from London, I from Cairo. He was smart, funny, understated, and generous.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He once walked up to me at a conference in Cairo to reintroduce 
        himself-we hadn't seen each other in a long time. In his typically humble 
        way, he claimed that he'd been following in my footsteps since Stanford.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And then I had the unfortunate timing of arriving in Pakistan, 
        on a temporary assignment, just a few days after Danny was kidnapped. 
        I had learned of his disappearance only as I boarded a plane to fly here, 
        in fact. So the whole experience has brought a real personal sadness to 
        the last month.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>What effect did the kidnapping have on reporting activities 
        in Pakistan? Did you and other reporters cut back on your work as a result?</b><br>
        It has certainly made most of my colleagues and me much more cautious 
        about what we do and who we meet with. There's a feeling that this could 
        have happened to any of us- I mean, by necessity in covering the Middle 
        East, you meet with militants and other shadowy characters. It's the only 
        way to get a grip on what's really happening.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But yes, my colleagues, my bosses in New York, and I spent 
        some time debating security arrangements. In the end, we beefed up the 
        guard staff at the private home that serves as our house and our office. 
        I for one have avoided seeking out militants in the way that I might have 
        in the past. I'm careful to always travel with a trusted driver or fixer. 
        And the <i>Times</i> and several other news organizations decided to keep 
        its correspondents out of Karachi, and to cover the story of Danny's disappearance 
        and his murder from Islamabad, the capital.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>Have you felt afraid or anxious for your safety as a 
        result of the recent events? Is it nerve-wracking working under the shadow 
        of such a potential threat?</b><br>
        I haven't felt particularly afraid, at least not since the first few days 
        after the kidnapping, when there were explicit threats that other journalists 
        would be kidnapped. But since then, as I said, I've been more cautious 
        about who I might meet with than I can remember being in the past. Some 
        of the recent stories I've written have discussed the links between militants 
        here and Pakistan's intelligence service, and some people here have warned 
        that that could stir up trouble as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It's not particularly nerve-wracking, just very sad and 
        grim. Danny's disappearance cast a big weight over my time here, and his 
        murder really hit home.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>What do you think are the longer term repercussions for 
        reporting and journalism as a result of the kidnapping? In particular, 
        in the Middle East and South Asian region?</b><br>
        It's hard to say right away. After the wave of kidnappings in Lebanon 
        in the late 80s and early 90s, most major news organizations essentially 
        pulled out, or at least barred their reporters who were American citizens 
        from going. I went into Lebanon in 1995 for the Times, when things had 
        very much quieted down, but I think I was the first American the paper 
        had sent in eight years or so.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It's sad when that happens because it adds to the disconnect 
        between the West and parts of the world, like the Middle East and South 
        Asia, that are so important.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I can't imagine yet that there will be such a reaction in 
        Pakistan or Afghanistan. About 10 reporters have been killed in the region 
        since the crisis began, I think, but all except Danny seem to have been 
        killed in combat or by bandits. Still, what was so chilling about Danny's 
        death was the way he was singled out and then lured to his death, and 
        the way his executioners chose to make a spectacle out of it. If, God 
        forbid, there should be more such kidnappings, then I think big news organizations 
        will think again about security. Certainly, though, all of us are going 
        to be much more careful about seeking out people like Ahmed Omar Sheikh, 
        which unfortunately means that it will take longer for parts of this story 
        to be told.</p>
