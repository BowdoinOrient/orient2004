      <p align="left"><font size="5">Students distribute $10,000 to non-profits</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A Bowdoin College student committee has awarded seven Common 
        Good Grants, totaling $10,000, to local non-profit organizations. The 
        grant money came from a restricted gift from an anonymous donor, intended 
        to create a program in which Bowdoin students could learn about grants 
        and philanthropy while building a relationship with non-profit organizations 
        in the greater-Brunswick community. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Over 50 applications were received and reviewed by a committee 
        of twelve Bowdoin students, led by community service resource center intern 
        Kate Leach '04, and advised by Lydia Bell, coordinator of student community 
        service programs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The following is a list of the grant recipients and a description 
        of the projects to be funded by the grant: <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Habitat for Humanity Bath-Brunswick: $725 to purchase supplies 
        for residents of a small community in Bath, Maine, to build raised beds 
        for vegetable gardens. These raised beds will allow families in the community 
        to grow vegetables that are pollution free, strengthen community ties, 
        and teach generations of residents how to grow sustainable food. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Flying Changes Center for Therapeutic Riding, Topsham: $1,400 
        to purchase a small pony (named Bowdoin) and a cart to add to their fleet. 
        This new cart and horse will be used to teach carriage driving to children 
        with disabilities who participate in the horse farm's activities. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">OASIS Health Clinic, Brunswick: $2,500 to purchase medicine 
        to begin an &quot;in-house&quot; pharmacy. OASIS is a free clinic, currently 
        open once a week, providing health care at no cost to members of the Brunswick 
        community. </p>
      <p align="left">Staffed by area doctors, the OASIS clinic will use the funding 
        to begin the &quot;It's in the mail&quot; program. Many patients receive 
        free prescriptions, but because of the required government paperwork, 
        it takes 4-6 weeks for the prescriptions to arrive by mail. The grant 
        will allow the clinic to keep medicines on hand, so patients can immediately 
        receive a month's supply from the clinic. When the prescriptions arrive 
        by mail, they will replenish the clinic's stock. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Home to Home Program, Brunswick: $1,400 that will fund two 
        facilitators for &quot;Caught in the Middle&quot; workshops for parents 
        in the Home to Home program. Home to Home provides a safe place for separated 
        or divorced parents to peacefully exchange their children for visitation. 
        Home to Home has had a positive influence on children from high-conflict 
        families throughout the midcoast area. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Harpswell Neck Fire and Rescue Department: $975 to fund 
        an MCI (multi-casualty medical) kit. The kit will assist the small Harpswell 
        Neck volunteer rescue department, which has only one ambulance, to respond 
        to multi-casualty calls. While the ambulance is transporting some patients, 
        the kit will allow other patients to receive care while waiting for back-up 
        emergency vehicles coming from Brunswick or Bath. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Friends of Cox Pinnacle, Brunswick: $500 contribution toward 
        the purchase of a piece of undeveloped land for community use. A group 
        of Brunswick residents is working through the town to purchase the plot 
        of land, which is perfect for outdoor recreation. They need to raise $125,000 
        in two years (which the town will match). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Freeport Middle School, Martial Arts Program: $2,500 to 
        pay for martial arts classes and transportation for 15 at-risk 8th graders. 
        This program allows students to participate in martial arts and build 
        their self-confidence, self-control, and discipline. The program also 
        has a tutoring component. <br>
        Awards will be presented to representatives of these organizations at 
        Bowdoin's annual Community Service Banquet Wednesday, April 3.</p>
