      <p align="left"><font size="5">Hyde at Spotsylvania and Fessenden in the Cabinet</font><br>
        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        COLUMNIST</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thomas W. Hyde, of the Bowdoin class of 1861 was among the 
        members of the reorganized Army of the Potomac, ready to spring forth 
        against Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia in May of 
        1864. Hyde served as a staff officer to General John Sedgwick, commander 
        of the Sixth Army Corps. May 4, 1864 was an early morning for the young 
        Mainer. Awakened before three a.m., Hyde drank coffee and poured water 
        on his head. After that he was ready to go. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Grant's columns crossed the Rapidan River in Northern Virginia 
        at numerous points- Hyde probably crossed with the rest of the Sixth Corps 
        at Germanna Ford. The Union troops were not resisted at any of their crossings. 
        This seemingly good luck, however, would not hold out for long since the 
        army was now stuck in the underbrush of The Wilderness- a 72 square mile 
        stretch of secondary growth woods filled with shrubs and impassable thickets. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Grant had no choice but to stay in The Wilderness until 
        his supply trains could catch up with him. It was here, in the thickets, 
        that Lee struck him on May 5th. Of the Battle, Hyde remembered, &quot;I 
        had dismounted to fix my horse's bit, when a canon-ball took off the head 
        of a Jerseyman; the head struck me and I was knocked down, covered with 
        brains and blood.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of the crucial moments of the Battle was on the evening 
        of the second day's fight when Confederate General John Gordon led a flanking 
        attack against the Sixth Corp's line. Hyde was sent down to rally some 
        troops with other staff members but the strength of Gordon's attack was 
        such that nothing could hold the men from retreating.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The carnage of the Wilderness was topped off by the fact 
        that hundreds of wounded soldiers from both sides, who were unable to 
        move, were burnt alive in the fires that erupted from the dry underbrush. 
        In the end the casualties of the Battle of the Wilderness reached around 
        17,000 for the Federals and 7,500 for the Confederates.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This horror, however, would continue as Grant continued 
        southward, trying to find open ground where he could utilize his superior 
        numbers. Near the town of Spotsylvania Courthouse, Grant's army dug in 
        to face Lee's new line of defense. In the early stages of this prolonged 
        battle the Sixth Corps was brought up to hold the line around Laurel Hill. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde, by this time, the 9th of May, was near exhaustion. 
        Still, he remembered that day, for it was a day that no one who loved 
        John Sedgwick could forget. When the corps commander approached a gun 
        crew and found many of its men lying down, hiding from whizzing bullets, 
        he laughed. &quot;They couldn't hit an elephant from here,&quot; Sedgwick 
        said, trying to inspire his men. The effect, however, was quite the opposite 
        when a sharpshooter's bullet slammed into the general's face, below his 
        left eye. He was dead within minutes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On both sides there was mourning for the fallen commander. 
        The greatest sorrow of all, however, must have come from the men who were 
        closest to Sedgwick- his staff officers. In the days to come there would 
        be bloodier events that overshadowed the death of one man.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the United States Senate, William Pitt Fessenden, of 
        the Bowdoin class of 1823 also felt the heavy hand of war. Two years earlier, 
        one of his sons, Sam Fessenden, Bowdoin class of 1861, had been killed 
        at Second Bull Run. Now, in 1864 another of his sons, Frank, had been 
        wounded in the Red River Campaign. In the end Frank Fessenden's leg had 
        to be amputated.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thus, with his family falling apart, William Fessenden returned 
        to the Senate knowing that his career was also falling into ruin. Once 
        friends, Fessenden and Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner had recently 
        become ideological enemies. The influential Massachusetts man planned 
        to get rid of Fessenden by using his power to block the re-nomination 
        of Vice President Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, in the hopes that Hamlin would 
        then run for Fessenden's Senate seat and win, forcing Fessenden to retire.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The winds of fate, however, had other plans for Senator 
        Fessenden. That same year Secretary of the Treasury Chase clashed with 
        President Lincoln. In the aftermath, Chase offered his resignation as 
        a gesture, believing that it would not be accepted. To his surprise, the 
        president signed off on it and out went Chase. In his place Lincoln wanted 
        to place David Tod of Ohio. </p>
      <p align="left">When Tod declined, however, Lincoln nominated Fessenden 
        as the new Secretary of the Treasury. The senator was confirmed for the 
        post in less than two minutes. But Fessenden vigorously protested the 
        appointment. He sent in a letter declining the position but Lincoln refused 
        it. When Fessenden spoke of his failing health Lincoln brushed the notion 
        aside. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, whom Fessenden turned for advice, 
        told him simply, &quot;you cannot die better than in trying to save your 
        country.&quot; Pressure from banks and other financial institutes also 
        mounted as representatives of these organizations informed Fessenden that 
        he had no choice but to serve, lest he be responsible for a financial 
        crisis. From the head of the New York Clearing House a telegram declared, 
        &quot;For your country's sake I beg you to accept the charge; your nomination 
        is universally approved.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden, who was the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, 
        knew all too well that the state of the economy was not great. Eventually 
        he agreed to the job with the guarantee that he would have complete control 
        over who served in the Department.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Fessenden entered into his new position the financial 
        situation looked was not encouraging. Even though stocks rose when news 
        of his appointment reached the traders the new Secretary of the Treasury 
        presided over a government arm, which needed to raise eight-hundred-million 
        dollars in the next year while trying to handle the national debt, which 
        had risen to well above one billion dollars.<br>
