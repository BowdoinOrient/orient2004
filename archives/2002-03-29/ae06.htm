      <p>All of Hollywood's cinematic turnout couldn't beat the drama of this 
        year's Oscars. Stunning upsets, lengthy but touching tributes, and cultural 
        breakthroughs made the 74th Annual Academy Awards one of the most memorable 
        awards shows in recent history.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Even though Whoopi hosted and the whole thing was four and a half hours 
        long, it was worth wading through the formal slush and prolonged accolades 
        just to see Halle Berry, in that gorgeous dress of hers, make history 
        as the first black woman to win the Best Actress Oscar. &quot;This moment 
        is so much bigger than me,&quot; she said (in an acceptance speech comparable 
        in sheer cuteness to Julia Roberts's from last year), &quot;it's for every 
        nameless faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door 
        tonight has been opened.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="right">

      <p>If that weren't groundbreaking enough, Denzel Washington followed up 
        by being only the second black actor to win Best Actor-and all this after 
        Sidney Poitier, his Best Actor predecessor, got an honorary golden guy 
        celebrating his stunning career. Previously, only 3% of acting awards 
        had gone to people of color. Is Hollywood now color-blind? &quot;I hope 
        so,&quot; said Halle in a post-win interview. I'm sure we all do. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking of colors, Russell Crowe turned a nasty shade of red after Denzel 
        pulled that stunning upset. To be completely honest, despite the amazing 
        night it helped create, Russell did deserve that award. His performance 
        as John Nash demanded hard-core talent that far exceeded the strains of 
        Denzel's role in Training Day. But hey-the guy just won last year. And 
        Ron Howard got a very undeserved Best Director Oscar for directing him 
        in A Beautiful Mind-clearly a consolation prize. Don't cry Russ. Go cut 
        your hair and better luck next year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Other surprises included Randy Newman finally getting his big break: 
        after 16 musical Oscar nominations over the decades, he finally won for 
        Best Original Song with &quot;If I Didn't Have You&quot; from Monsters, 
        Inc.. &quot;I don't want your pity,&quot; he said once up at the podium. 
        Well, he got mine anyway. Go Randy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The rest of the awards followed the Golden Globes example: Jennifer Connelly 
        and Jim Broadbent took away the supporting awards, and, if you managed 
        to stay up late enough, you saw A Beautiful Mind take home the last and 
        greatest statue-Best Picture.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The unusual thing about these Oscars was that no one movie swept up all 
        the awards. All the acting awards went to different movies, two of which 
        weren't nominated for anything else. Despite Lord of the Rings's 13 nominations 
        and A Beautiful Mind's eight nods, both came out even with only four total 
        wins each. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This won't be known to future movie buffs as any single movie's year-but 
        maybe they'll say it was Halle and Denzel's year; the year when Hollywood 
        finally recognized that America has different kinds of people with enormous 
        talent and their own stories to tell. The future seems more colorful in 
        Hollywood since last Sunday-studios are realizing that because America 
        isn't all white so neither should be its most popular art form. The doors 
        have been opened. Let's see what comes through. </p>
