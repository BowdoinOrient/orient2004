      <p align="left"><font size="5">Israel and the world's need for peace</font><br>
        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font></p>
      <p>At the beginning of Spring Break, I was moved by a photograph on the 
        front page of <i>The New York Times</i>. It displayed the aftermath of 
        a suicide bombing in a posh neighborhood in Jerusalem. I viewed the shocked 
        and forlorn faces of young Israelis, roughly the same age as most of us, 
        as people attempted to make sense of another senseless and random act 
        of violence. Seeing these seemingly helpless expressions touched me because, 
        at that moment, they symbolized the prospects for peace; stalled and breeding 
        only death and destruction on both sides.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Nearly three weeks later, there has been little progress. Just last Wednesday, 
        15 Israelis died in a suicide bombing as they celebrated the Passover 
        Seder. Despite the efforts of American special envoy General Anthony Zinni, 
        it is unlikely that a formal peace deal will be reached. The only hope 
        is that America's involvement in the region will mollify extreme actions 
        on both sides of the dispute. Additionally, the Arab League has endorsed 
        a Saudi peace plan that would grant Israel &quot;normal relations&quot; 
        in exchange for an Israeli pullback to the pre-1967 borders. Israel has 
        also withdrawn some troops from Palestinian refugee camps, but is talking 
        about making more serious invasions if the suicide bombers do not cease 
        their indefensible attacks. <br>
      </p>
      <p>America finds herself in a diplomatically difficult position. On one 
        hand, Israel has a right to take preventive actions to defend itself against 
        future terrorist bombings. However, the large numbers of women and children 
        killed in Israeli raids rightfully disturbs us. President Bush declared 
        those Israeli actions &quot;not helpful&quot; earlier this month, and 
        America is seeking to garner Arab support for an attack on Iraq. Arab 
        leaders are understandably reluctant to give such support while there 
        is still daily violence in Israel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some American commentators are equating Israel's war with the Palestinians 
        to our own war on terrorism. George Will said on ABC's &quot;This Week&quot; 
        on March 17 that the PLO wants to end Israel's existence. He cited evidence 
        that the first suicide bombing took place in 1965, two years before the 
        current borders were established. William Bennett wrote in the March 20 
        Washington Post that &quot;...America and Israel's fates are one in the 
        same.&quot; He went on to say that both countries are democracies that 
        respect basic human rights and both have a fundamental right to self-defense 
        against those who &quot;rule by bullets rather than ballots.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>In many respects, both Will and Bennett are correct. The level of anti-Semitism 
        in many Arab newspapers and schools makes one wonder how seriously some 
        Arab countries, or their populations, would take a formalized declaration 
        of &quot;recognition,&quot; &quot;cease fire,&quot; or &quot;peace process.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, in a <i>New York Times</i> Op-Ed piece on March 10, Thomas Friedman 
        explains the necessity of at least attempting a peace process. He mentions 
        three reasons why an &quot;unrelenting&quot; Israeli policy toward the 
        Palestinians is a sure recipe for disaster: Israel's numerous Arab neighbors, 
        a &quot;baby boom&quot; of young Arabs, and the influx of satellite TV 
        that propagates hateful messages from Osama Bin Laden and other radicals. 
        Friedman's article cites as an example an Egyptian student who told his 
        professor that &quot;eight small, suitcase-sized nuclear bombs&quot; could 
        end the problem of Israel.<br>
        When young, singularly focused terrorists begin discussing weapons of 
        mass destruction in a tone that is beyond hypothetical, the civilized 
        world must take notice. Though it is true that we cannot acquiesce to 
        terrorists, we also cannot provoke them to manifest their most sinister 
        dreams.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Friedman concludes his piece by saying that if Israel's &quot;uncompromising 
        view becomes dominant in Israel and among American Jews&#133;the country 
        is doomed. Because there are so many more Muslims than Jews to be killed, 
        and weapons of mass destruction are becoming so much smaller and so much 
        cheaper, it won't be long before the student in my Egyptian friend's story 
        gets one of his eight bombs and wipes Israel off the map.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>As long as terrorists like Osama Bin Laden exploit the plight of Palestinians 
        to advance their destructive agendas, peace in Israel and in the West 
        will be inextricably linked. Therefore it is time for leaders on both 
        sides of the conflict to dampen down their inflammatory rhetoric and reach 
        a peace agreement. It may not stop all the bombings and attacks, but it 
        is an essential step in the right direction in that it may get previously 
        recalcitrant governments to take positive steps against terrorism. If 
        anything, the events of the last six months have taught us that it is 
        not just the fate of the Middle East, but also the fate of the civilized 
        world that hangs in the balance.</p>
