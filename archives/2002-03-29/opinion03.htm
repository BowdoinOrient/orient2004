      <p align="left"><font size="5">Cheating: What is it?</font><br>
        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIMER</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Kitty and Ritchie had a typical Bowdoin relationship. They 
        had been hooking up pretty regularly for two or three months, usually 
        once a weekend when there had been a party at Ritchie's house. They had 
        pleasant conversations during the day and no awkwardness the morning after 
        a sleepover, although they had never been on a date and didn't refer to 
        each other by any sort of label like &quot;boyfriend&quot; or &quot;girlfriend.&quot; 
        But after the night that Kitty walked in on Ritchie hooking up with another 
        girl, he could not understand why she was so upset and accused him of 
        cheating. Unfortunately, what is and what is not is often unclear. So 
        this week, I investigate WHAT IS CHEATING?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In many cases, cheating is easily defined. Jackie called 
        herself Frank's girlfriend, so when she slept over at another guy's house, 
        it was clear she was cheating. On the other hand, when Dave went home 
        with someone else, Lily couldn't call it cheating because she and Dave 
        had really only hooked up a few times and sporadically at that. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But what about more ambiguous circumstances, such as Kitty 
        and Ritchie's? The two hadn't discussed the parameters of their relationship, 
        or whatever it was. At the same time, the fact that they had a routine 
        established over a significant period of time means that Ritchie's actions 
        would certainly affect Kitty. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Does merely &quot;affecting&quot; someone constitute cheating? 
        Because if this were the case, whenever a person hooked up, he or she 
        would be cheating on anyone who could have a crush on him or her at the 
        time. Knowing that another person likes you can't be called cheating.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, it is pretty clear that Ritchie was, in some form, 
        disrespecting Kitty. If trust and respect are the foundations of a true 
        relationship, then cheating is an act of dishonesty and disrespect. Too 
        often such actions are excusable under the auspices of an &quot;undefined 
        relationship.&quot; But regardless of definition, if two people have any 
        sort of understanding, even if it is only based on routine, breaking it 
        is a breach and is cheating. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Caitlin comments, &quot;If you hook up with someone four 
        times in a row, it's definitely something. Three times and it's still 
        random, but four means that it's known you will go home together. It doesn't 
        have to become a relationship after four; it can stay as just a hookup. 
        But there would have to be a definite end before one person could really 
        start with someone else.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dave agrees. &quot;Yeah, after three it's just like I know 
        I can go home with her. So if she left a party with some other guy I would 
        be upset, no doubt. I know she's not my girlfriend, but that's still not 
        okay- I still expect her to respect me.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Research and experience have yielded some more truths about 
        cheating. First of all, it is impossible to cheat on an ex-boyfriend or 
        girlfriend. Of course it is certainly possible (and quite tempting, really) 
        to break bonds of trust and respect once a relationship has ended. But 
        when a relationship is over, it's over. The people who look upon their 
        ex-boyfriends' consequent hook-ups as cheating are slightly delusional. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That said, there are a great many ways to disrespect an 
        ex, especially by badmouthing them to consequent hook-ups and significant 
        others. This is really quite un-called-for and the fact of the matter 
        is, it's just plain cruel. People who do such things should probably be 
        punished by lethal injection.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I have also found that it is extremely possible to cheat 
        on someone with an ex. For unknown reasons, some people believe that once 
        a relationship has ended, the exes are free to hook up with each other 
        indefinitely and without consequence. This is wrong, especially in the 
        case of people with a relationship at Bowdoin who hook up with ex-boyfriends 
        or girlfriends from home. It is not all right to claim that hooking up 
        with an ex-boyfriend is not cheating. It may, in fact, be far more harmful 
        to one's current relationship than if it had been an utterly random hookup. 
        If one wants to get back together with an ex, he or she should break off 
        the current relationship cleanly and honestly before going back. Doing 
        otherwise would be unnecessarily hurtful and unfair.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cheating doesn't usually happen without involving a hookup. 
        As Carrie says, &quot;You can't really cheat by just talking to someone 
        else.&quot; She is right, except that relationships do have a sort of 
        intimacy that goes deeper than sex. Achieving that sort of familiarity 
        or confidence with someone other than one's boyfriend or girlfriend may 
        be construed as cheating, and in some cases, it is rightfully so.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Consequently, while we all know cheating is bad, we may 
        also find ourselves guilty of it by lack of clarity. So here it is, spelled 
        out again: cheating may be defined by a display of disrespect and/or dishonesty 
        towards someone who is not wrong to expect you to privilege them over 
        another person, for whatever reason. It is never warranted and rarely 
        justifiable. In keeping with the spirit of the holidays, I will conclude 
        by reminding you to do unto to others as you would have them do unto you.
