        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p>In early March, President Bush chose to impose tariffs (i.e. taxes) of 
        up to 30% on steel imports. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Dear President Bush (and Lawrence Lindsey, Class of 1976, since you are 
        far more likely to see this):<br>
      </p>
      <p>As an economist with strong libertarian instincts, I find the social 
        conservative component of the Republican Party appalling. Yet, I have 
        provided my vote (and a bit of money) exclusively to the Republican Party 
        since 1984. Many loyal Republicans would be comfortable making a similar 
        statement.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Why do people with libertarian instincts support the Republican Party? 
        Because of its, generally, pro-market orientation. It's a trade-off. Given 
        the low probability that truly oppressive social policy will ever be politically 
        successful, the enormous welfare benefits associated with market based 
        economic policies easily outweigh the costs imposed by the social conservatism 
        of the Party. But, at times, it can be a close call. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So what does your administration choose to do? Protect the steel industry. 
        An economic policy decision that is astoundingly stupid, from an economic 
        perspective. To quote the <i>Economist</i>, &quot;This steel-tariff plan, 
        it is important to remember, lies well outside the ordinary run of bad 
        economic policy: it is so wrong it makes other kinds of wealth-destroying 
        intervention feel inadequate.&quot; This simply isn't the least bit ambiguous.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps (although probably not) a few steel industry jobs may be saved 
        at a number of companies; at a cost of millions of dollars per job? Of 
        course, your tariffs will cost the economy far more jobs than are saved. 
        All the industries that use steel have effectively had their taxes raised 
        by your low tax administration. Result: job loss. Consumers will now have 
        to pay more for cars, washing machines, etc., and have, thus, effectively 
        had their taxes raised. This will necessitate reduced purchases across 
        a broad array of goods. Result: job loss. Most perversely, there will 
        be more jobs lost at the many relatively efficient steel producers, whose 
        business involves producing finished steel products using IMPORTED steel 
        which must now be purchased at a higher price thanks to you, than will 
        be saved by your tariffs. And now we learn that rather than being flooded 
        by cheap imports, the U.S. actually is facing a troubling shortage of 
        steel.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If all this isn't enough, consider the impact of your tariff decision 
        on the worldwide movement toward free trade. You purport to understand 
        the enormous benefits of the free trade. But you choose to provide every 
        protectionist in the world with a ready excuse for resisting the lowering 
        of trade barriers. Does this make any sense?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Have you noticed that economic growth in the U.S. is no longer based 
        on low skill manufacturing, but rather on growth in knowledge based industries? 
        I feel certain your economic advisors explained that such industries rely 
        on large markets and would benefit immensely from expanded trade. Did 
        you listen? I wonder if your wise political advisor(s) pointed out that 
        most of those libertarian types who hold their noses and vote Republican 
        are employed in the knowledge based industries that will suffer from the 
        negative trade consequences of your tariffs? I suspect not. <br>
        Your decision has cost this country significant economic growth. You have 
        made us all poorer. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And why?<br>
      </p>
      <p>To help the steel workers, that is, to show your compassion? Please. 
        It would be far cheaper to write checks of a size sufficient to permit 
        each of those who would lose their jobs absent tariffs to retire. How 
        about the argument that &quot;unfair&quot; trade can't be permitted? Hmmm. 
        They sell us steel too cheap; this is a problem? Please. Okay, so what's 
        left? Much to my chagrin, all I can find is some votes in the rust belt.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many of us were unhappy to have a president who seemed to make policy 
        based on crass political calculation. However, even crass, calculating 
        President Clinton couldn't stomach steel tariffs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So let's see. I vote Republican because of the Party's market orientation. 
        My Republican president adopts anti-market policies-policies a President 
        Gore would never have chosen. So I now have the worst of all possible 
        worlds: repugnant social conservatism and anti-market economic policy. 
        Much appreciated.<br>
      </p>
      <p>My advice? Contemplate the prospects of a politician abandoned by the 
        thinking component of his political base.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Gore '04!</p>
