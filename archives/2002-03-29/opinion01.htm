      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bowdoin the business and genetic chaos</font><br>
        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></p>
      <p align="left">I spent most of my two-week vacation contemplating my mixed 
        genetic background and the bodily confusion that is its direct result. 
        I am half Italian (give or take a quarter Turkish here and there) and 
        half Irish (give or take a quarter Scottish here and there), which means 
        that the diametrically opposed genetic forces at work in my body are engaged 
        in a constant struggle for power that leaves me confused and more overweight 
        then some might imagine. My &quot;diverse&quot; genetic background has 
        helped create a confused, hairy-chested, pasta eating, shinny-armed, fat-legged 
        drunk with a baby face, and a slowly-changing patriarchal view of the 
        world. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At times, I find myself longing for the genetic homogeneity 
        of the Northern Europeans. What I wouldn't give to be a strapping Danish 
        man descended directly from Odin himself, with a genetic code that reads 
        like a psalm from the King James Bible. Over break, I often found myself 
        daydreaming about carrying on my Nordic heritage in the blissful utopia 
        that is modern-day Denmark, alongside a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, socially 
        liberal but financially prudent woman. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As I said, I am both Irish and Italian, and the result is 
        a confused and inconsistent bodily makeup that manifests itself in a laundry 
        list of insecurities and irrational hang-ups. My lack of genetic consistency 
        and the resulting bodily puzzlement allowed puberty and the &quot;awkward 
        stage,&quot; both ravagers of self-confidence in most adolescents, to 
        truly obliterate any possibility that ever existed for me to be a normal 
        functioning person. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Do Northern Europeans face the same issues? If they do, 
        they really haven't gotten their minds around the concept of empathy-seeing 
        as the six months I spent in Denmark were marked by rejection followed 
        ceaselessly by rejection at the hands of beautiful and clearly unimpressed 
        Danish women. Who can blame them?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This thinking brought me directly to the issue of grade 
        inflation at Bowdoin. Most times when I am confronted with the pressing 
        Bowdoin issue of the day, I turn my head quickly back to the deli-meat 
        sandwich I am consuming and focus the whole of my attention on not getting 
        mayonnaise on my shirt. Unexpected spills and stains really hamper my 
        quest to never do laundry. I'll wear the same outfit for a few days straight, 
        but once there's a stain, I have to draw the line. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, it's easy to understand why I have little time for petty 
        discussions that do not concern me. Grade inflation, though, is different. 
        I don't really care that everyone gets higher grades these days, but it 
        does seem a little silly that C's and B's have become &quot;bad&quot; 
        grades. This doesn't make sense to me, but I think I have figured out 
        a way that Bowdoin can stamp out grade inflation once and for all.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin is an institution dedicated to the liberal arts 
        education of young men and women from around the world. However, like 
        my misaligned body, Bowdoin too suffers from the strain of diametrically 
        opposed forces. <br>
        To a certain extent, Bowdoin's main goal is the education of young people. 
        However, on the other hand, Bowdoin is a multi-million dollar corporation. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The large amount of money involved in the giving and receiving 
        of a Bowdoin education mandates that school administrators bring a strict 
        business sense to discussion of the college's practices. Here we see the 
        same intrinsic sort of lacking in institutional conformity that creates 
        the seemingly untenable intricacies of my body and mind and leaves me 
        bed-ridden and nauseous for most of the Maine winter. While ostensibly 
        dedicated to the value and provision of education, Bowdoin is also a functioning 
        business. If it were to stop functioning as such, it would cease to be 
        a school that provided education. To simplify: Bowdoin is in the business 
        of providing education. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This setup functions well, especially when the goals of 
        Bowdoin, the business, coincide with the goals of Bowdoin the college. 
        However, there are times when conflicts arise and negative externalities 
        result-like grade inflation, an increasingly belligerent security force, 
        and having to pay to make copies. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to deal with grade inflation, an issue that affects 
        Bowdoin's legitimacy as a school and hence as a business, we must infuse 
        money into the equation, thereby creating a situation where grades actually 
        matter and directly effect the school's financial well-being. I propose 
        that a pay scale be developed, so that students could receive rebates 
        according to what grades they earned each semester. A's could go for $400, 
        B's for $300, C's for $200, D's for $100, and F's would receive nothing. 
        Checks could be mailed home along with report cards and a message encouraging 
        students to use the money to buy books and other supplies to better their 
        educational experience. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This proposal would work on many levels. First, with the 
        new system, it wouldn't be long before a slew of memos from administrators 
        ended up in the mailboxes of professor urging them to curtail grade inflation. 
        With the college losing money at a rate directly proportional to the leniency 
        of professors, one can be sure that grade inflation would come to a rapid 
        end and perhaps would be replaced by a new process-grade &quot;deflation.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The new system would also award the smartest and most talented 
        students by awarding them with something tangible: money. The free market 
        would work its magic and instantly transform the Bowdoin education from 
        liberal relativistic endeavor to a pursuit fraught with life lessons about 
        hard work.</p>
