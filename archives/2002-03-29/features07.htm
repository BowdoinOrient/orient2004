        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG<br>
        ALUMNUS CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left">It was three weeks before I could steel myself to go back 
        to the Lower East Side. Coming to pick me up at the Hotel Chelsea, Ron 
        all but had to hold my hand. The whole neighborhood-formerly the Jewish 
        Ghetto, now full of hippies, blacks, and Hispanics, many of them drug 
        users or pushers-for me had something sinister about it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Actually, I wasn't staying at the hotel anymore (one week 
        there having cost me more than I thought I could afford in view of what 
        little money I had left) but at the friendly night clerk's around the 
        corner, a spacious if simply furnished place shared by one or two others 
        on a temporary basis it seemed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of these was an attractive yet slightly strange young 
        fellow just released from juvenile detention center on Rikers Island, 
        who kept saying to me, apropos of nothing, so you're aspiring to higher 
        places, eh? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I suppose he meant higher things, having been told by our 
        friend the night clerk that I was a filmmaker. But immediately the old 
        paranoia returned and I thought maybe he was talking about expediting 
        me to places beyond human recall. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another new acquaintance I made through the good offices 
        of the kind Englishman (offering me his hospitality without any quid pro 
        quo) was a young singer called Gilbert Price; no relation to Leontyne 
        Price, the black primadonna I'd met while still at Columbia, or in her 
        class, but a former member of the Harry Belafonte Singers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Gilbert at the time was touring resort hotels in the Catskills, 
        and on one occasion asked me to come along. He sang a medley of Beatles 
        songs that went down very well with the audience of mainly Jewish New 
        York housewives. He was also auditioning, he told me, for one of the leads 
        in an upcoming musical based on the life of Alexander Dumas, for which 
        among others the comedienne Hermione Gingold had already been signed. 
        <br>
        This was to have its pre-Broadway try-outs on the West Coast. Being on 
        rather friendly terms with Gilbert by then he asked me to look him up 
        there, if he got the part.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ron in the meantime had taken himself off to Timothy Leary's 
        open-to-all community in upstate New York to go on mind-expanding trips 
        with the Prophet of LSD that really freaked him out. I tried LSD too, 
        but with results even more disastrous than when I'd taken 'speed'. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was a real horror trip. Before my eyes, Ron, who was 
        meant to supervise it, turned into a cadaverous little man with wispy 
        Ho Chi Minh beard, frightening me to death rather than providing reassurance. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not long after this Ron went back to the West Coast. When 
        my new friend Gilbert, having got the part in the Dumas musical, also 
        departed for LA, I was left high and dry in New York. What's more, with 
        hardly any money left in the bank. Believe it or not, I'd gone through 
        5000 dollars (worth a lot more then) in just under a year. Fortunately 
        I had enough left for a one-way ticket via Greyhound to San Francisco, 
        costing me 99 dollars I think. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Much as I'd loved driving across the continent, this was 
        a hellish trip, sitting up day and night on the bus. Somewhere along the 
        line, in the middle of Iowa, when the driver stopped to drop someone off, 
        I felt like getting out too and just walking away with them, like Charlie 
        Chaplin into the sunset. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But, lo and behold, when coming out of the Bus Depot off 
        Market Street in San Francisco, who should be there squatting on the sidewalk 
        but good old Ron, in colorful hippie garb, selling the rebellious student 
        paper, The Berkeley Barb. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Off we went to Ron's pad on Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley: 
        a windowless room where when you turned the light on the walls were crawling 
        with cockroaches, scurrying away as quickly as possible, only to reappear 
        the minute it was turned off. Thank God this infested idyll didn't last 
        long. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not far away in Fulton Street were the premises of the Vietnam 
        Day Committee, the student organisation that planned most of the anti-war 
        demos in the Bay Area. When Ron started hanging out there with Jerry Rubin, 
        the hippie leader who a year later helped organize the violent demonstrations 
        during the Democratic Convention in Chicago, I thought the time had come 
        for me to take myself off to LA to look up my singer friend. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During rehearsals for what its producers hoped would be 
        a Broadway hit, Gilbert was staying in a studio apartment near Farmer's 
        Market in Hollywood. A diabetic, he had to inject himself three times 
        a day, but occasionally forgot. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rushed to hospital on one such occasion, without the producer 
        being told, the latter came looking for his missing leading man at the 
        apartment, and not informed as to his leading man's private life either, 
        was amazed to find me there. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was the summer of '67, and Number One on the Hit Parade 
        was the haunting House in New Orleans. Backstage, in-between matinee and 
        evening performances, we played cards with Hermione Gingold and Gilbert's 
        understudy, high most of the time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite indifferent reviews the show went on to San Francisco. 
        There it flopped, and Gilbert returned to New York, bequeathing me his 
        pad just below Nob Hill, with a hippie girl called Janet for a neighbor. 
        (By all means tune in again next time.)</p>
