      <p align="left">A nationwide search for a new assistant dean of student 
        affairs is getting underway this week. According to Senior Associate Dean 
        of Student Affairs Tim Foster, it will be difficult to fill the shoes 
        of Mya Mangawang, who will depart the College after four years in the 
        position.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;She's done an awful lot in that time,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;She has tremendous judgment, and she's highly principled and committed 
        to students&#133;.I really appreciate the way she challenges people to 
        do their best. She has incredible drive....You bring that into an office, 
        and it affects everybody.&quot;<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">The national search committee consists of students, faculty, 
        staff, and Foster himself. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We've posted the position in the Chronicle of Higher 
        Education, Black Issues and Higher Education, a variety of local newspapers 
        and publications, on the Bowdoin website, and so on,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Associate Professor of Physics Steve Naculich, a former 
        Judicial Board (J-Board) member and current chair of the Recording Committee, 
        and Associate Professor of English Ann Kibbie, a House Advisor, are the 
        committee's two faculty members. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of the staff members is Director of Health Professions 
        Advising Sue Livesay. The other staff member has yet to be confirmed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nick Hiebert and Ann Barmettler, both juniors, will serve 
        as student representatives on the committee. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;They both have Res Life experience and are very involved 
        on campus,&quot; Foster said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The committee's first meeting was yesterday, and the development 
        of search criteria was on the agenda for that gathering. A Master's degree 
        is among the requirements, but Foster indicated that the committee would 
        be looking for important non-academic characteristics as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;First, before we even get into the business of evaluating 
        individual candidates, we want to think about what we're really looking 
        for,&quot; he said. &quot;We've heard from Mya and some of the J-Board 
        members about what they think is necessary.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think that there needs to be an optimism for the 
        role of education in students' lives,&quot; Mangawang said. &quot;And 
        a sense of idealism; a vision for a principled, better space here at Bowdoin-one 
        that is more honest, civil, and based on respect.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I think the one-on-one contact with students is what's 
        most defining about the position,&quot; Foster said. &quot;It's a demanding 
        position.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mangawang concurred. &quot;I have spent most of my time 
        advising, counseling, and generally supporting students through their 
        times at Bowdoin,&quot; she said. &quot;The most meaningful moments have 
        been personal, reflective [ones] that I have been blessed to share with 
        individual students.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Aside from her work with Bowdoin undergraduates in student 
        affairs, Mangawang also served as Director of Fellowships and Scholarships. 
        <br>
        &quot;I have tried to provide some support for these students who opt 
        to pursue opportunities in an accessible and helpful way,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, she acted as the J-Board's advisor while at 
        Bowdoin, and created some systems that hadn't previously been in place: 
        annual reports, a letter articulating guidelines, and the like. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;My work with students on the J-Board has been a most 
        rewarding endeavor,&quot; she said. &quot;I have had the opportunity to 
        watch these individuals grow through their years in a way that was wonderfully 
        satisfying.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The relationships she's formed with the various J-Boards 
        over time have been really important, for both Mya and the students,&quot; 
        Foster said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Tara Talbot, student chair of the J-Board, has known 
        Mangawang over the course of her time at the College. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Through her work with the J-Board, she has made significant 
        changes that made Bowdoin a better place,&quot; Talbot said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Foster pointed out Mangawang's success in organizing a lot 
        of different responsibilities. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;When she first came here, she walked into a newly 
        created position,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, she's leaving behind a big 
        job for the next person, but that person isn't walking in needing to recreate 
        the wheel. The process and organization she's leaving behind is wonderful.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Foster, the office expects a good deal of interest. 
        <br>
        &quot;It's hard to know at this point, but we'll probably end up with 
        around 100-150 candidates,&quot; he said. &quot;We've already had about 
        20 responses.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We'll take this big group and narrow it down to about 
        20, and then the committee will conduct phone interviews,&quot; Foster 
        continued. &quot;After that, we'll invite three or four people to campus 
        for interviews with students, faculty, and staff-different constituencies 
        on campus. They'll fill out evaluations, give their feedback, and we'll 
        meet as a committee to make an offer.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The committee hopes to have Mangawang's successor appointed 
        by the end of the academic year. &quot;We want to wrap up by mid-May,&quot; 
        Foster said. &quot;It's an aggressive timetable, but we want to have the 
        interviews take place while we're in session, so people can see what the 
        campus is like.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mangawang plans to pursue a Ph.D. in History of Art at Bryn 
        Mawr College. While she indicated that she was excited about the prospects 
        of continuing her education, she said that she thinks it likely that she'll 
        return to a similar form of employment after receiving her doctorate.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I have high hopes for the work done on these campuses,&quot; 
        she said. &quot;I hope that there will always be a place for me in higher 
        education, in one form or another.&quot;</p>
