      <p align="left"><font size="5">Savion Glover, tap phenomenon</font></p>
      <p align="left">Last night, renowned tap dancer and choreographer Savion 
        Glover performed to a full house in Pickard Theater. If students were 
        unable to procure tickets for the performance, they have another chance 
        to see him today at Common Hour where Glover will both lecture and perform.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Glover's kinetic talents were apparent even during his youth 
        in Newark, New Jersey. By the age of two, Glover and his older brothers 
        were beating rhythms out of everything. &quot;Walls, pots, closet doors. 
        We'd get different sounds out of everything,&quot; Glover reminisces. 
        Noticing his talent, Glover's mother enrolled him in a Suzuki drumming 
        class at the age of four and a half. Shortly thereafter, an audition was 
        arranged for the Newark Community School of the Arts and it resulted in 
        him becoming the youngest recipient of a scholarship in the school's history. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When he was seven, Glover began show tap lessons, at the 
        Broadway Dance Center in New York. And after seeing Chuck Green and Lon 
        Chaney's exhibition of rhythm tap, he knew what he wanted to do. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was not long before Glover turned his tap dancing into 
        a profession, doing shows, films and specials. When he was eleven years 
        old he made his debut as the star of &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot; on 
        Broadway. He also was in &quot;Black and Blue&quot; in Paris, in 1987, 
        a role for which he received a Tony nomination. Glover played opposite 
        Sammy Davis Jr. and Gregory Hines in the film &quot;Tap&quot; at the young 
        age of fifteen. In this movie he was cast as the &quot;heir apparent&quot; 
        of tap dance. In 1991, he received the Martin Luther King Jr. Outstanding 
        Youth Award. In 1992, he raised the roof dancing with his mentor, Gregory 
        Hines, in &quot;Jelly's Last Jam&quot;; this time earning himself a nomination 
        for the Drama Desk Award for best actor. He then spent a year on the road 
        touring with Maurice Hines, Gregory's brother, in &quot;Jelly's Last Jam&quot;. 
        Glover also had a five year stint on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; among many 
        other television appearances including Dance In America: Tap! with Gregory 
        Hines and Tommy Tune. By the age of nineteen he was able to buy a four-bedroom 
        house for his mother in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, in which he occupies 
        a large wood paneled basement apartment. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">His teachers include Jimmy Slyde, Gregory Hines, Henry Le 
        Tang, Chuck Green, Lon Chaney, Honi Coles, Sammy Davis Jr., James (Buster) 
        Brown, and Arthur Duncan. These lessons were not lost on Savion, he absorbed 
        everything. &quot;I call him the sponge. He learns very quickly,&quot; 
        says Le Tang, one of his many teachers. In this way he is almost a &quot;living 
        repository of rhythm,&quot; as George C. Wolfe, the director of &quot;Bring 
        In Da Noise, Bring In Da Funk&quot;, puts it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now 23 years old, Glover is single-handedly changing the 
        way tap is traditionally viewed. He received an endowment from the NEA, 
        making him the youngest recipient of an NEA grant in NEA history. Glover 
        recently performed at the Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to the Nicholas 
        Brothers and appeared at the 1996 Academy Awards performing a tribute 
        to Gene Kelly. Just this year he became the youngest recipient of the 
        Dance Magazine Award. He is currently starring in &quot;Bring In Da Noise, 
        Bring In Da Funk&quot; on Broadway, a show which he choreographed and 
        conceived. He received two Tony nominations, out of the shows nine and 
        won the Tony for Best Choreography as well as a Drama Desk Award. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Today, Glvoer spends much of his spare time teaching tap 
        to kids. In fact, almost everything he does professionally is aimed at 
        spreading the word about tap. He wants everyone to know tap is alive and 
        out there. &quot;I feel like it's one of my responsibilities to keep the 
        dance alive, to keep it out there, to keep the style,&quot; says Glover. 
        This is why he has set up Real Tap Skills and taught classes in all 65 
        cities he visited on the road when touring with &quot;Jelly's Last Jam&quot;. 
        He also has plans to start a tap school for kids. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is undeniable that Savion Glover has developed his own 
        unique style of tap dance. With so much genius already pouring out of 
        him, Glover himself says with conviction, &quot;I don't think I've peaked 
        yet.&quot; </p>
