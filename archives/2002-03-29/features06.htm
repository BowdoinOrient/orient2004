      <p align="left">Nat Wheelwright, professor of biology, along with former 
        student, professor Corey Freeman-Gallant of Skidmore College, recently 
        received a grant for a collaborative study on Savannah sparrows. Wheelwright, 
        a behavioral ecologist by trade and Freeman-Gallant, an evolutionary biologist 
        who uses molecular techniques, will be looking at numerous questions concerning 
        the adaptive significance of female mate choice with an emphasis on extra-pair 
        paternity, which arises when females copulate with males other than their 
        social mate). The scientists, along with students from both colleges, 
        will assess the role of the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) as 
        a measure for predicting female fidelity. They are testing the hypothesis 
        that females prefer mates that will bring genetic diversity to their offspring, 
        particularly with regard to immune function. Student researchers will 
        spend the summer on Kent Island collecting field data on the birds, using 
        knowledge from Wheelwright's past 15 years of research on the subject. 
        They will ask such questions as: What factors contribute to female mate 
        choice? Are the underlying physiological clues that correspond to the 
        compatibility of genes between two birds detectible?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Walking waist-deep through blooming goldenrod, counting 
        gull eggs, digging under leaf litter for fungi, and clamping colored bands 
        on the fragile legs of Savannah sparrows, Wheelwright, Freeman-Gallant 
        (Bowdoin '91), and their students will rise with the sun, explore their 
        questions, and spend the summer on a secluded island full of discoveries. 
        Four of the eight students sent to live on the island will be working 
        on the Savannah sparrow project, while the others design other natural 
        history, art, and carpentry projects. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This project will include not only testing previously identified 
        pairs but will also include egg mortality monitoring. Further collaboration 
        between Bowdoin and Skidmore during the academic school year will enable 
        student researchers from both institutions to complete honors theses. 
        Molecular analyses will be completed at Skidmore in Freeman-Gallant's 
        lab.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wheelwright inherited the title of director of the 1.8 mile-long 
        island in 1987. Of his first journey there, he muses, &quot;the light 
        was singing and rich and drenched with color.&quot; The magical Kent Island 
        is located 5.4 mi. (9 km) south of Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy. 
        Visitors from Brunswick drive North to the U.S.-Canadian border at Calais-St. 
        Stephens. The students, the van, food enough for a month, all the boots, 
        raingear, and research materials load onto a ferry to Grand Manan Island. 
        Seal Cove resident Russell Ingalls, longtime friend of Kent Island and 
        Nat's, welcomes the group onto his lobster boat. After a forty-five minute 
        ride, the muddy landing on Kent Island is thick enough in places so that 
        visitors have to watch that their shoes don't get sucked off as they navigate 
        their footing on the slippery seaweed-covered rocks.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At first, this island could seem daunting as it threatens 
        to remove the walls of comfort with its early mornings, gritty air, and 
        cold wind. But Wheelwright sees this as beauty. &quot;I even love the 
        fog and rain,&quot; he claims. Overall, however, Wheelwright gushes about 
        the experiential learning that an environment such as Kent Island allows. 
        While on Kent Island (K.I. for veterans), there are no televisions, no 
        videos, no credit, and no grades. &quot;It's a place where students, teachers, 
        little children, and old men gather together to learn what learning is 
        about,&quot; Wheelwright said. The communal dinners spark conversations 
        about daily discoveries and are often followed by music, skits, and games. 
        In providing students with this opportunity to create their own community 
        and live in a small cottage, surrounded by enthusiastic people, Wheelwright 
        enables them to come out of their comfort zones in an environment that's 
        challenging but safe. He supports learning in this way and advocates &quot;pulling 
        students out of Facilities Management tidiness.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Freeman-Gallant and Wheelwright will construct a challenging 
        environment in which their students will be learning, designing, and asking 
        their own questions of their mentors, each other, and themselves. Freeman-Gallant 
        will teach Wheelwright about molecular lab techniques while Wheelwright 
        will contribute his long-term data set; both will be heavily involved 
        in field work. Both men will bring energy, excitement, and a strong work 
        ethic to the project. The collaboration will not be the first (nor the 
        last), but it will certainly have its own challenges and delights. When 
        asked about the difficulties of undertaking a project of this magnitude, 
        Wheelwright smiled. &quot;The summer's gonna go fine. We always learn 
        lots.&quot; With regards to possible concerns about the partnership, Wheelwright 
        beamed, &quot;Corey is such a dynamo. It's gonna be a glide.&quot;</p>
