      <p align="left"><font size="5">Card access system will be reviewed</font></p>
      <p align="left">In a <a href="../2002-02-22/opinion_eds.htm">previous editorial</a>, 
        it was stated that students could not use their ID card to access other 
        dorms after 2:00 a.m. This is incorrect. Students are actually stranded 
        an hour earlier than that.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although students are able to access their own dorms at 
        all times, they do not have access to other dorms between the hours of 
        1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. This is the original policy that was recommended 
        to Residential Life by an all-student committee. Since then, the policy 
        has not been questioned. Perhaps now would be a good time to do so. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is unclear why students originally decided that locking 
        down the dorms would be a good idea, but it may simply have been that, 
        at the time, students were accustomed to Security or Facilities locking 
        entry doors after midnight.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Denying students access to all dorms other than their own 
        is undoubtedly a safety issue. A student walking from the library to his 
        or her room in Winthrop Hall after 1:00 a.m. would have no quick means 
        of escape if he or she felt in danger while walking along the Quad.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the very least, this policy should be reviewed by Student 
        Government. It certainly contains the potential for very dire consequences, 
        and to simply accept it without question is to ignore the safety needs 
        of the student body.</p>

      <p align="left"><a name="2"></a><font size="5">Change in grading system 
        will affect students</font></p>
      <p align="left">The faculty will vote Monday on whether or not to institute 
        a grading system that includes pluses and minuses. While the majority 
        of faculty support such a system, the majority of students do not. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Faculty members cite a number of reasons for their support 
        of a plus/minus grading system-that it would allow for better feedback 
        to students, that it would help us in getting into professional schools, 
        that it will let us &quot;speak the same language&quot; as other schools. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of these reasons have some merit, but not at Bowdoin. 
        No number of logical reasons can make such a change a worthy one here. 
        Any set of reasons will inevitably point to one thing: that grades are 
        and should be important indicators of one's education. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If our intense four years here aim at simple certification 
        for jobs or graduate school, then grades might be the reason why we are 
        here: to act as formal endorsements of our ability to function within 
        the academy or some industry. But that is not why we are here.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most students came here because Bowdoin promised us a wholesome 
        education that was an end in itself; the College claimed to encourage 
        us to grow intellectually in an uncompetitive and sharing environment. 
        Our current grading system supports such an environment, as much as any 
        grading system can, because it rightly devalues evaluation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin is the only school of its kind to de-emphasize of 
        grades using such a system, and if the Faculty does away with our current 
        system, it will essentially render Bowdoin to be academically identical 
        to every other small liberal arts college like Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin has historically rested closer to the fringe of 
        higher education; it has been, in the past, described as &quot;cranky,&quot; 
        not afraid to stand alone in a culture that values sameness. Are we suddenly 
        afraid to be different?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But, as the survey showed, most faculty will say that their 
        reasons for desiring a change have nothing to do with being like others; 
        rather they think it allows for better feedback and fairer evaluation 
        for both internal and external purposes. Students, however, have made 
        it clear: we recognize the differences between our system and other systems, 
        and we do not want ours to change. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All too often in administrative decision-making, the opinion 
        of the students is sought and then looked on as nothing more than a simple 
        curiosity and thus ignored. There is a definite danger that faculty members 
        will vote for a change to a plus/minus system because they, rather than 
        the students, think that there should be such a change. But this would 
        be a mistake: a change in the grading system affects the students, and 
        only the students. And the students have said that they do not want the 
        system changed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to preserve our current grading system, a large 
        number of individual faculty members must actually vote against their 
        personal instincts and cast their votes on behalf of the student body. 
        We urge all faculty members to keep this in mind at the faculty meeting 
        on Monday.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A vote for a plus/minus grading system would not only undermine 
        the purposes of a liberal education, and specifically a Bowdoin education, 
        but it would undermine the values of the student body as a whole.<br>
