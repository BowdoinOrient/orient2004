      <p>It is perhaps an irony that currently in our &quot;information age&quot; 
        it is harder than ever to hold on to information. When we have a current 
        need for information, it's not so hard. But when it comes time to store 
        information for future access, that's when the problems start. <br>

      <p>Institutions all over the world are currently dealing with the problem 
        of storing electronic records, now that so much material exists, in many 
        cases, only digitally. While electronic data has existed in various forms 
        for decades, the need for a new archiving technology became urgent only 
        within the past ten years or so. The need, which coincides, of course, 
        with the rise of the PC, email, and the web, is made pressing by a number 
        of factors: that the volume of coded information is so much higher than 
        before, that so much information exists only electronically with no paper 
        format, that electronic storage media do not last long, and that access 
        to electronic records is often lost as technologies advance and make others 
        obsolete. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The permanence of the storage media is a major concern: standard digital 
        storage media, at this point in time, simply doesn't last as long as paper. 
        Quality paper will last 500 years or more and microfilm 200 years or more. 
        Disks typically have a life of 2 to 5 years, though higher quality disks 
        might last 30 to 50 years. And whereas paper and microfilm show wear and 
        tear, signaling a potential information loss, digital storage media do 
        not. But even if the digital storage medium lasts, the hardware and software 
        that can read that information normally do not.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite that people are dealing with the question everywhere, there are 
        no formal or informal standards, and no sufficient technology, in place 
        at the current moment, which leaves individual institutions, like Bowdoin, 
        to fend somewhat for themselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to many archivists, the best way to hold on to digital information 
        right now is still to print it out. Such is the advice of Richard Lindemann, 
        director of Special Collections and Archives, who noted that this issue 
        arose, at Bowdoin, only about three years ago. &quot;Everybody in the 
        archival world is talking about this and nobody has an answer to it, and 
        that's pretty much where it sits,&quot; he said. &quot;And so, we sort 
        of have to customize to our own local needs until there's a magic silver 
        bullet somewhere. My ultimate report to the powers that be at Bowdoin 
        is ultimately going to be: print it out whenever you can.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This is especially true for email retention. Special Collections and 
        Archives saves printed out emails, as it must preserve information, documents, 
        and artifacts that document the history of the College. Lindemann noted 
        that roughly three percent of an organization's documents are determined 
        to be of lasting value, and correspondence makes up a large chunk of those 
        documents. It's the responsibility of the department or organization to 
        produce and print this material, though. &quot;It's the people who create 
        the documents that are responsible for maintaining them in a medium or 
        a way that preserves them.&quot; Lindemann and his staff, however, advise 
        others on how to do this.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But printing is not practical for everything. It's fairly easy for saving 
        email, but not for records management-for certain financial or personnel 
        files, for examples-which is in many cases legally mandated. A good deal 
        of records are entirely digital and have no paper equivalent. A number 
        of departments at Bowdoin already store old records electronically, such 
        as Human Resources and the Controller's Office. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Another issue is website storage. &quot;I don't think anybody would be 
        able to fish up the first website for Bowdoin,&quot; Lindemann said. &quot;We 
        know that it's archived&#133;it's in the basement of Adams Hall somewhere.&quot; 
        But even if they found the specific tape that it was saved to, he said, 
        there's little guarantee that they could open the files. Website storage 
        is important not only for the College's websites, but also for recording 
        faculty's scholarship, which in many cases has moved online.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While there are some software programs that harvest websites (that is, 
        save the pages), most of these do not maintain any interconnectivity that 
        one page might have with other pages or files. So, what is saved is often 
        just a visual screen without complete text, formatting, or graphics. &quot;At 
        this point the best we probably can do is set some sort of time schedule 
        and burn CDs with the various college websites,&quot; Lindemann said, 
        but he added that they have not done that yet. &quot;Partly that's because 
        we're not sure that's what we want to do and partly that's because those 
        are getting saved and are archived in CIS for the short term. So we know 
        that time is a little on our side.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile there is a lot of research and development being done to create 
        standardized and reliable means of retaining and accessing e-records. 
        The proposals for grants to research the subject have skyrocketed. One 
        big push is between the National Archives and the San Diego Supercomputer 
        Center. Together they are working on a program called Emulation, which 
        takes any type of software and any type of files and builds a new program 
        to work as though the files are running in that software, even though 
        that software isn't running it anymore.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Lindemann is charged with the task of writing up a preliminary electronic 
        records policy for Bowdoin, which he plans to complete sometime this spring. 
        He called it &quot;a story that has no ending,&quot; given the uncertain 
        nature of e-record archiving, but he did say he sees some hope for the 
        future. &quot;I think the problem has to be solved, not because of college 
        archives, but because of business requirements and national government 
        requirement.&quot; The federal government, for example, requires that 
        every federal agency save all emails-nothing can be deleted. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Lindemann said, &quot;As we get more open code and more standard about 
        the way things should be saved, that's going to make things easier too.&quot; 
        And once usable fixes have been developed, archiving will be, in many 
        respects, easier: e-records demand considerably less-though not cheaper-storage 
        space, they are much easier to index, and they offer greater access to 
        everyone.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Where does Bowdoin stand in relation to the rest of the archiving world? 
        According to Lindemann, &quot;We are sensitive and prudent but not foolishly 
        revolutionary. And that's a good place to be, I think.&quot;</p>
