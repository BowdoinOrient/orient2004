        III powerhouse Norwich on March 9. The Bears took 3-0 and 7-0 losses in 
        first-round series play against the Cadets, who went on to compete in

      <p align="left">While the season's finish was relatively disappointing for 
        the Bears, news of significant honors for team captain Mike Carosi '02 
        brightened the postseason. He was named to the Eastern All-America first 
        team by the American Hockey Coaches Association, and was selected for 
        the Gridiron Club's second annual Joe Concannon Award given to the top 
        American-born hockey player from NCAA Division II and III colleges in 
        New England.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're very proud of Michael; it's one of the highest 
        individual honors to be named an All-American and is well-deserved,&quot; 
        Meagher said. &quot;I'm happy for him and for the program.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Carosi totaled 47 points in the 2001-2002 season, tallying 
        13 goals and 34 assists. His 124 career points place him among Bowdoin's 
        top scorers of all time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that Carosi affected the team's mentality. 
        &quot;More than anything, he showed them the way to play: hard, with passion 
        and accountability to show up for practices and games&#133;. He led by 
        example and reminded them to work hard,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;I'm 
        really proud of how he conducts himself away from the rink as well, he's 
        just an outstanding Bowdoin citizen.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He cited the senior class as crucial to this season's achievements. 
        &quot;You can correlate success with the type of leadership you have,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;This was one of the best classes we've had here. The seniors 
        set a high standard for next year; they are competitive and play within 
        the rules, but also have wonderful personalities and bring a lot of joy 
        to a long winter season. More than anything else, I'm going to miss them 
        as people.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I thought it was one of the most enjoyable winter 
        seasons we've had,&quot; he continued. &quot;The success of all our teams, 
        the interaction of athletes, coaches, students.... It was so healthy, 
        and just a lot of fun.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bear hockey season ended in the first weekend of March, 
        in the first round of NCAA Division III competition. Before the men reached 
        nationals, however, they faced Trinity in a NESCAC semifinal game, and 
        ended up on the losing end of a 3-2 score after overtime. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Trinity struck first, getting on the board at 14:03 in the 
        first period. Bowdoin's Sean Starke '03 answered just under a minute later, 
        tying the game at 1-1. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Later in the second frame, the same sort of sequence occurred-Trinity 
        got a goal, this time from Joseph Ori, and was answered about a minute 
        later by Polar Bear Matt Kovacich '05. The game stayed tied through the 
        end of regulation play, despite several chances for both sides and a disqualified 
        Bowdoin goal that was kicked into the net. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ryan Stevens of Trinity got the winning goal past sophomore 
        goaltender Mike Healey at 9:45 in the extra period. Healey totaled 28 
        saves on the night.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We lost a heartbreaker in overtime,&quot; Meagher 
        said. &quot;But I thought we played very well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We actually played very well all through the playoffs,&quot; 
        he continued, referring to the two NCAA quarterfinal games-both against 
        Norwich-in which the Bears were shut out. The first, played on March 8, 
        ended with a 3-0 score, while the second resulted in a more lopsided 7-0 
        margin for Norwich.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was just the nature of goal sports; they were a 
        very strong defensive team,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;[In the second game,] 
        we outshot them 13-2 in the first 12 or 13 minutes of the game, but we 
        couldn't score. Then they came down and capitalized, and before we knew 
        it, it was 3-0. That made it a different game.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;They were the hottest team going at that time; they ended up losing 
        the national championship,&quot; he said. &quot;Although we didn't score, 
        I thought we really competed as a team. We played hard, and I'm happy 
        with how we played.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>After returning from spring break, the men began wrapping up the season 
        this week. &quot;We're going through the 'debriefing' right now,&quot; 
        Meagher said. &quot;It was a wonderful year, and we enjoyed it. It's always 
        hard not to win your last game, but when you reflect back, the year had 
        a lot of positives.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team won't attempt to reassess and reorganize until the 2002-2003 
        roster is finalized. &quot;We'll see how recruitment goes, then we'll 
        start to focus on needs,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We also have to look 
        at people's health; we've got some players out and we're really hoping 
        they're going to be well.&quot;</p>
