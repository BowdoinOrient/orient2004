        life?</font><br>
        <font size="2">GENEVIVE CREEDON</font></p>
      <p align="left">I have a niece who is a junior in high school right now 
        and is agonizing over college. She doesn't buy the idea that college isn't 
        worth worrying about, as I'm sure most of us similarly did not.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Choosing where to go to college is probably the only decision 
        towards which I have ever been apathetic. It simply didn't matter to me. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I won't say whether or not I was right, but most people 
        pitied my point of view. They wondered how I wasn't excited about such 
        a major decision, but as far as I was concerned, all schools were fairly 
        similar.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Like seniors in high school facing college, most college 
        seniors have either a general idea of what they're going to do after graduation 
        or are scurrying to find out. I asked someone a question today that I, 
        myself, cannot answer: &quot;What do you wish to do with your life?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Within the first three words, the answer entailed a job 
        of some sort. Most people's answers would likely entail future plans, 
        but those aren't the right answers to the question. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even before we join the workforce, we define our lives and 
        ourselves by jobs. We're pre-med, pre-law, pre-fill-in-the-blank. It's 
        a cycle that follows us indefinitely, it seems. In high school, everyone 
        wants to know where we're going to college. As we enter college, everyone 
        wants to know what our major will be. As we leave college, everyone wants 
        to know what we're going to do to make a living. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Those questions are all valid. Certainly we have to answer 
        them at some point, but should they really be the first priorities? By 
        the time I'm a senior, my goal is not to be able to tell anyone what job 
        or graduate school awaits me. It is to be able to say what life awaits 
        me. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I tell my niece every day that she has nothing to worry 
        about in the college process. She should enjoy it and find the medium 
        between freaking out and being completely apathetic towards it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And the question &quot;What do you wish to do with your 
        life?&quot; really shouldn't be any more stressful. The ideal answer is 
        different for each one of us, which is certainly the way it should be, 
        but I'd like to think that most of us do not want our lives to be defined 
        merely by our schools, our majors, or our jobs.</p>
