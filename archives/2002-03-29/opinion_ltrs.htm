      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>After several hours of steamy foreplay, candles burning low, you look 
        deep into your partner's eyes, and you are overwhelmed by the desire to 
        have sex&#133;.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Did you know that current laws in many states, including Maine, require 
        that a man or women receive sober, verbal permission from their partner 
        before having sex? It has recently come to our attention that some people 
        on campus consider this law constraining, a hindrance to gallantry, a 
        blockade to chivalry and traditional relationships. They contend that 
        in the heat of the moment asking permission is awkward, difficult, and 
        dissuasive. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe it is for them. But not for you. We at Safe Space are looking to 
        find the people on campus who have the smooth words to get the green light 
        on sex. <br>
      </p>
      <p>You have the chance to negate misconceptions, rebuke the skeptics, and 
        affirm the laws that mandate respect. We present you the opportunity to 
        publicly prove that respect and chivalry are compatible, passion and discussion 
        are congruent, and that laws requiring permission are not restrictive, 
        but rather an opportunity for romantic eloquence and respectful preamble. 
        We allow you to demonstrate your ability to be natural, suave, romantic, 
        funny, poetic, persuasive, and creative; win hearts on campus, teach your 
        competition a lesson, and get some cash.<br>
      </p>
      <p>To enter, respond to the following: In bed, in the heat of the moment, 
        you make the decision that you want to have sex with your partner. You 
        look into his or her eyes, profoundly, and request consent. Write what 
        you would say. Your goal is to get laid and obey the law. Hey, this is 
        college. And don't put your partner to sleep; 150 words maximum.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Limited to Bowdoin students, faculty, and staff. All genders and sexualities 
        are encouraged to participate. Send submissions as an attachment to <a href="mailto:akoppel@bowdoin.edu">akoppel@bowdoin.edu</a> 
        or <a href="mailto:jmcdonne@bowdoin.edu">jmcdonne@bowdoin.edu</a>. Questions 
        and comments can be sent to the same addresses. <br>
        <br>
        Final date of submissions is April 9. The winner will receive $75. Second 
        prize is a dinner for two in Brunswick, and third prize is two tickets 
        to Hoyts Cinema in Cooks Corner. The winners will be published in the 
        April 12 <i>Orient</i>. Anonymity is optional, but will not benefit your 
        love life.</p>

      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p> Clean Air-Cool Planet and the Bowdoin College Department of Facilities 
        Management recently embarked on an important study that will ultimately 
        generate a picture of Bowdoin College's greenhouse gas emissions over 
        the last ten years. Clean Air-Cool Planet is an action-oriented advocacy 
        group that seeks to reduce the threat of global warming by engaging all 
        sectors of civil society to take actions that lead to rapid cuts in greenhouse 
        gas emissions. Its University Greenhouse Gas Emission program has given 
        schools like Bates and UNH a comprehensive picture of their contributions 
        to climate change and has helped them to generate goals for future reductions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While a change in the Earth's climate can be caused by many different 
        factors, the current issue of human impact, often called &quot;global 
        warming,&quot; refers to the release of gases that change the composition 
        of the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, the most famous of which is carbon 
        dioxide, all occur naturally in the atmosphere and help to keep the Earth 
        at its life-supporting average temperature of 15.5&deg;C by absorbing 
        the sun's radiation. Increased human emissions are now raising that temperature. 
        The ecological, social, and economic impacts of this trend are incalculable. 
        By recognizing this problem and working towards a solution, Bowdoin not 
        only sets an example for other colleges, but also upholds the tradition 
        of working towards the Common Good.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The unique feature of the Clean Air-Cool Planet University Greenhouse 
        Gas Emission program is the Emissions Calculator Software used to analyze 
        the emissions of each gas and calculate the contributions of any campus 
        activity relative to the overall output, such as faculty and staff commuting 
        or campus electricity use. With this information, the Bowdoin community 
        can begin to pinpoint major sources of environmental impact and discuss 
        ways of reducing them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The initiation of this project here at Bowdoin is a timely one, as the 
        issue of environmentally aware practices has had a growing presence on 
        our campus. The advent of Keisha Payson's new position as Sustainability 
        Coordinator in Facilities Management and the subsequent birth of Sustainable 
        Bowdoin, boasting more than 45 student members, make apparent the community's 
        concern for Bowdon's &quot;environmental footprint.&quot; By the end of 
        this year, we should see a reduction in the volume of paper campus mailings, 
        improved recycling infrastructure at the Pine Street, Harpswell, and Brunswick 
        Apartments, and the addition of an environmental mission statement to 
        the student handbook.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions will require changes in behavior 
        at an individual and institutional level. We at Sustainable Bowdoin aim 
        to keep the larger Bowdoin community informed, provide a forum for discussing 
        the issues of sustainability, and to help the community and its members 
        change in ways that benefit the environment and the Common Good. For more 
        information on Clean Air-Cool Planet, head to <a href="http://www.CleanAir-CoolPlanet.org">www.CleanAir-CoolPlanet.org</a>. 
        Also, watch for a new Sustainable Bowdoin web page in the coming weeks, 
        where you'll find information on everything we're up to, including updates 
        on the Clean Air-Cool Planet study. Until then, contact <a href="mailto:rmeyer@bowdoin.edu">rmeyer</a>,
