      <p>Saturday, March 2 was a big day for the equestrian team, one of Bowdoin's 
        less-know club sports.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

          <td><font size="2">The Bowdoin Equestrian Team started the season strongly 
            with three outstanding performances by Elizabeth Norton '05 in various 
            riding divisions. (Courtesy of Bryony Heise)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The team, only in its third year, currently has five members and competes 
        in roughly eight horse shows per year. Each show is hosted by one of the 
        nine schools in their region, which includes schools in Maine, New Hampshire 
        and Vermont. Riders compete in jumping and on the flat in classes divided 
        by experience level, all riding unfamiliar horses.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This particular Saturday, after much preparation, the Bowdoin and Bates 
        teams were co-hosting the show at Chez Chevaux Equestrian Center in Durham, 
        the barn of their coach (and Bowdoin alumna) Karen Lappas.<br>
        Bowdoin's sole representative in the jumping classes was Elizabeth Norton 
        '05, competing in the Novice division. Apparently unfazed to be riding 
        in her first collegiate show, she won first place in her class with a 
        poised and graceful ride. Norton went on to win another first place in 
        her Novice flat class.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With her two first places, Norton earned the right to compete in a third 
        class (against the two other riders who had also won two firsts) for the 
        title of High-Point Rider. In what was definitely the highlight of the 
        day for the Bowdoin team, she defeated two other very talented riders 
        to win this class as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The four other Bowdoin riders competed in different classes of the Advanced 
        Walk-Trot-Canter division with strong finishes by all. Captain Anne Torregrossa 
        '02, Bryony Heise '04 (riding in her first collegiate show) and Elspeth 
        Faiman '04 all took second places, and Ben Dyer '02 took a third.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All the Bowdoin riders' excellent finishes, and particularly Norton's 
        High Point Rider distinction, are especially noteworthy since many rival 
        schools hold try-outs for their teams and have up to thirty riders.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The following weekend, Anne Torregrossa, Elspeth Faiman and Ben Dyer 
        traveled to Vermont for a show at Middlebury (Norton and Heise were unable 
        to attend due to spring break plans). Although the team was reduced in 
        size, members rode well, with Torregrossa and Faiman taking third places 
        and Dyer taking a fourth.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With her third, Torregrossa earned enough points to place out of the 
        Walk-Trot-Canter division and into the more advanced Novice division. 
        Torregrossa has been a member of the team since her sophomore year when 
        she began competing in the beginner Walk-Trot division. Moving up to the 
        Novice division is particularly exciting as it means she will now be able 
        to compete in the jumping classes as well as on the flat.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After such a successful start to the season, the equestrian team is looking 
        forward to shows at Dartmouth and the University of Vermont. In addition, 
        by pointing out of her division, Torregrossa has qualified to compete 
        in the Regional show, which will be held at Dartmouth at the end of the 
        season.</p>
