        <font size="2">SAMUEL C. DOWNING<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In a shock to the Bowdoin sports community, Director of 
        Athletics Jeff Ward, announced late last week that Bowdoin is eliminating 
        the alpine ski team. One of only a handful of Bowdoin sports that regularly 
        competes in Division I, the team stars one of Bowdoin's top athletes, 
        Siri Ashton, a sophomore who raced at the NCAA championships in Anchorage, 
        Alaska, last year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The centerpiece of a $200,000 departmental cut, the program's termination, 
        expected by March, stunned Bowdoin's alpine skiers. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's far more than just a sport for us, it's a way of life, a part 
        of who we are,&quot; said team captain Sarah Laverty '03. </p>
      <p align="left">
        President Barry Mills asked Ward to trim seven percent of his department's 
        budget, which, like most areas of the College, is feeling the pinch of 
        our financial situation.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alpine skiing was targeted, Ward said, because it carries the highest 
        cost-per-student of any varsity team, even if it had a full roster of 
        only 20 students. The team's schedule also conflicts the most with the 
        academic program, he said. Alpine skiing's total cost for the school, 
        which does not pay for training trips, is $60,000, a figure comprised 
        largely of the coach's salary.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward praised the alpine coach, saying, &quot;Martin Wilson is a fine young 
        coach, and to lose him is a loss for the whole College.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Wilson, who has worked as alpine skiing coach and part-time tennis coach 
        during his five years at Bowdoin, will be out of a job by March 14. He 
        said while he is thinking about his next step, he is more concerned about 
        the future of Bowdoin's alpine skiers and about how they were treated 
        in the process.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The way the athletics budgeting decisions were made, he said, &quot;was 
        exactly opposite of what we are trying to teach the kids here.&quot; The 
        school and the athletics programs teach students honor, loyalty, and integrity, 
        he said, and encourage students to take responsibility for decisions that 
        affect them and their school. This time, he said, &quot;When they did 
        try and make themselves heard [about the athletics cuts], the response 
        was almost patronizing.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward said he tried to contact senior coaches for advice, but ultimately 
        he had to make the choices himself. &quot;I had conversations with as 
        many people as I could,&quot; he said, &quot;but responsibility for the 
        final decision was mine.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward said he understands why the team is angry. &quot;This is a vital 
        portion of their life. I understand and respect that a lot,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Wilson and his top skier said that the administration led them on last 
        year, claiming Ward guaranteed the continuation of the program through 
        2005.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We got a verbal commitment that as long as Siri [Ashton] and her 
        class were around, Ward would see the program through,&quot; Martin said,. 
        &quot;Ashton said she was curious about what Ward's reaction would be 
        &quot;when I remind him of that promise.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward did not deny making the commitment last year. However, he did say 
        it was before he knew of the current budget crisis. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;My comments to them were in a different context,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;I had no sense that this budget cut was coming up. That's all I 
        want to say.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ashton also accused Ward and the administration of disregarding the personal 
        effects that the cut would have on team members.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It was really unfair and very unprofessionally done,&quot; she said. 
        &quot;They gave us no time to prepare ourselves emotionally. This is an 
        enormous part of my life. I came to Bowdoin . . . excited to contribute 
        to a growing program. It is devastating to have that taken away.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Even as Wilson worries about his own future, he is deeply concerned about 
        the future of his racers, Ashton said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Martin is doing a whole hell of a lot,&quot; Ashton said. &quot;He 
        has been staying so strong to help us- his team-get through this.&quot; 
        She says the school will miss his quiet positive outlook and deep knowledge 
        of skiing. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;He is unbelievable, amazing. I have had a lot of different coaches 
        in my career,&quot; she added. &quot;He is most definitely the best I 
        have ever had.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Laverty will graduate in the spring, but other racers are considering 
        the possibility of transferring. Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley 
        has begun inquiring as to whether students could compete with the Bates 
        team, Laverty said. &quot;He is becoming supportive in helping the kids 
        on the team as he learns about their situations.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The bigger picture of the athletics budget is still a source of concern.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward said he worries about the health of athletics funding, but said he 
        thinks Mills' commitment to keeping school admissions &quot;need-blind&quot; 
        is extremely important. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;President Mills and the rest of the senior staff worked very hard 
        to do this as fairly and as equitably as they could,&quot; he said, &quot;and 
        I really appreciate that.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The decision was a very hard one to make,&quot; he said. &quot;But 
        the essential question is: could we do what we do effectively with a $200,000 
        budget cut?&quot; The answer, said Ward, was a clear &quot;No.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Because two thirds of the athletic budget pays the salaries of coaches 
        and staff, he said, cutting the budget across the board, rather than eliminating 
        an individual program, would have meant asking all coaches and athletic 
        staff to take a pay cut. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The other budget cuts in athletics come from eliminating the training 
        room intern position for next year and leaving the fourth assistant coaching 
        position on the football team vacant after Phil Soule's retirement this 
        year.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ward noted he will try and make up cuts made earlier this year to the 
        Leadership Training Program for team captains through grants and perhaps 
        institutional resources. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Athletics has a lot of educational messages and one of those is 
        leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as I am athletic director, we 
        will look at ways to facilitate that and strengthen it.&quot;</p>
