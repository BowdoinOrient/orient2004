        <font size="2">BEN KREIDER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Anyone who has watched television in the last year has 
        probably seen some of the latest anti-drug commercials. The commercials, 
        some of which aired during the past two Super Bowls, imply that drug money 
        funds terrorism. While these ads were created with the intention to decrease 
        U.S. drug use, they are so ridiculous that they conjure up images of those 
        failed ads featuring fried eggs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There are a number of reasons why these ads go too far. First of all, 
        the ads are sensationalistic creations meant to do little more than shock 
        people. The Office of National Drug Control Policy, which funded the ads, 
        is trying to play on Americans' knee-jerk reactions to the word &quot;terrorism.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Americans are so paranoid about terrorism that they shudder whenever they 
        hear the word, no matter what the context is. Our government knows this, 
        and they have decided to use it to create these manipulative pieces of 
        drivel. Rafael Lemaitre, spokesman for the Office of National Drug Control 
        Policy, admitted that the ads played on Americans' sensitivity to terrorist 
        references.</p>
      <p align="left">
        President George W. Bush has tried to rally Americans by associating the 
        drug war with patriotism. &quot;If you quit drugs, you join the fight 
        against terror in America,&quot; said Bush. It's ironic that Bush, himself 
        a former drug user, is now imploring Americans to quit drugs. Since Bush 
        quit drugs, you can too!</p>
      <p align="left">
        The ads try to tug at our heartstrings by demonstrating how terrorists 
        allegedly use drug money for murders, kidnappings, and other acts of unspeakable 
        horror. One child featured in the ad says, &quot;I helped murder families 
        in Colombia.&quot; This child looks like he is no older than twelve. Are 
        we supposed to believe that twelve-year-olds use cocaine and heroin, the 
        primary drugs produced in Colombia?</p>
      <p align="left">
        After showing several more people who are allegedly responsible for the 
        deaths of others, the ads conclude with this message: &quot;Drug money 
        supports terror. If you buy drugs you might too.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        It seems that the government is looking for a scapegoat for the disappointing 
        war on terror. Not one to accept blame for his own mistakes, Bush has 
        decided to blame one of the most pathetic, helpless groups of Americans: 
        drug addicts.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Nowhere in these ads are there any facts about drug money supporting terror. 
        Viewers are simply supposed to believe that if the government states something, 
        it must be true. Not only that, but the word &quot;might&quot; is used. 
        The government is not positive that drug money funds terrorists, yet we 
        are supposed to feel guilty. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are many other purchases that &quot;might&quot; fund terrorists. 
        Every time Americans fill their cars with gas, they &quot;might&quot; 
        be supporting terror. In fact, the link between oil money and terrorism 
        is much clearer than the link between drug money and terrorism.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Not only are the ads misleading, but they are also a colossal waste of 
        U.S. taxpayer dollars. Congress approved nearly $1 billion in 1998 over 
        five years for the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. There are 
        far better ways to spend this money. Why not spend this money on homeland 
        security measures that could actually stop terrorism? U.S. citizens should 
        be outraged that the government would spend the money on this.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The government has also wasted billions of dollars on the perpetual war 
        on drugs, which has been notoriously unsuccessful. Perhaps this money 
        and the ad could have been used to improve drug treatment facilities rather 
        than support both a lost cause and a propaganda campaign.</p>
      <p align="left">
        American teenagers are too smart to be fooled by these ads. Those who 
        want to use drugs will continue to do so; a few cute ads are unlikely 
        to convince them that drugs are bad. Perhaps if the ads actually talked 
        about the dangers of drug use, kids might get the picture.</p>
