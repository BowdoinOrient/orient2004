      <p align="left">Temperatures tonight are expected to drop into the teens. 
        The slushy puddles around campus-sometimes known as pathways-will turn 
        back into sheets of ice. At least one of your friends will take a serious 
        spill. That's the weather that visual arts majors Ellen Kenney '03, Eric 
        Legris '03, and Arnd Seibert '04 are hoping for, anyway. The three are 
        opening a joint art show this evening, and such a climate will add the 
        appropriate ambience to their event.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The exhibition is entitled &quot;Freeze,&quot; and it is no accident that 
        thermometer readings are related to this name. The opening is taking place 
        outside, by the Visual Arts Center, from 9:00 p.m. until midnight tonight.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Freeze,&quot; beyond fitting Maine's wintry weather, has its roots 
        in a movement that began in late-1980s Britain. &quot;Freeze is based 
        on a 1988 exhibition by Damien Hirst that sparked the YBA [Young British 
        Artists] movement in London,&quot; explained Seibert. &quot;We are taking 
        this title literally and therefore ridiculing it.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As for the somewhat unconventional setting for the exhibit, the artists 
        say they are interested in high visibility on campus. &quot;Freeze is 
        meant to be a spectacle. The YBAs were known for their shameless self-promotion,&quot; 
        said Kenney. &quot;We're parodying that and also using it at the same 
        time to challenge the seriousness of art on campus.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's also funny that we're picking up the YBA title, because YBAs 
        are on their way out,&quot; said Seibert.</p>
      <p align="left">
        These YBAs-Young Bowdoin Artists-are on their way up, however. The art 
        they will be displaying demonstrates great creativity and skill.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Legris's paintings are each about a yard long, with an abstract style 
        that includes human figures. He explains that some of these &quot;unintentionally 
        incorporate the styles of Marcel Duchamp's 'Nude Descending a Staircase,' 
        Pablo Picasso's beach nymph series, and Al Giocometti's drawing-based 
        portraits.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Other work by Legris in &quot;Freeze&quot; include a series that he says 
        &quot;collage[s] human forms together in social gatherings with fauvist 
        color and a high priority for composition.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Seibert's works include what he described as a &quot;rather large painting 
        that questions the current status of traditions of painting.&quot; His 
        works draw the viewer in with their lavish use of color. Though he kept 
        the details shrouded in mystery, Seibert also promised, rather mysteriously, 
        that his show would include &quot;a Xerox of unprecedented size.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kenney's works include painted wooden cutouts ranging from approximately 
        one to five feet tall, inspired by images she found online. &quot;I'm 
        intrigued by the internet. It showcases people's exhibitionist tendencies,&quot; 
        said Kenney. On the other hand, she contended that posting pictures on 
        the Internet &quot;doesn't take a lot of risk because they're really very 
        anonymous.&quot; Kenney's works explore this dual mentality, depicting 
        people in unusual poses, but without enough detail to make them painted 
        individually recognizable.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kenney, Legris, and Seibert are very grateful to the people who have helped 
        make the show possible. They &quot;thank SAFC [Student Activities Fee 
        Committee] and Art Club for their generous support and a shoulder to cry 
        on,&quot; said Seibert.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mike Ngo '04, who has viewed the art during its development, has high 
        hopes for the show. &quot;I think the art is going to be very engaging,&quot; 
        he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Kenney emphasized that they want the show to be fun. &quot;At openings 
        no one ever talks about art anyway, so we're just throwing a party,&quot; 
        she added. And you're invited-just don't forget your mittens.</p>
