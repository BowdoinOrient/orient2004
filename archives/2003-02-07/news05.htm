      <p align="left">As director for the Center for Innovation and the Environment 
        at the Progressive Policy Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan think-tank 
        in Washington D.C., Mazurek frequently addresses issues of environmental 
        concern. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In what she called her indictment against the current administration, 
        she addressed the need to reinvent &quot;first generation&quot; environmental 
        management in order to reflect new economic realities and industrial restructuring. 
        First addressing partisan politics, she said that &quot;environmental 
        policy. . . was not always a partisan issue. There was strong bi-partisan 
        support in the 1960s and 1970s to take state laws and local ordinances 
        and grow them up into this federal system we have today.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        She cited the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and many other acts 
        as products of these past environmental concerns. She singled out in the 
        Clean Air Act, signed by President Nixon in the last days of his term, 
        as a strong example of unified support.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But Mazurek and many others like Richard Lazarus, a law professor at Georgetown 
        University, have noted a shift in partisan support. The polls show voters 
        looking more to Republicans to be stronger on issues such as defense programs, 
        while Democrats are seen as more readily associated with environmental 
        concern and social programs. </p>
      <p align="left">
        She continued by saying, &quot;Unfortunately we find ourselves in this 
        incredibly polarized situation which started during the Reagan era and 
        abated somewhat during the first Bush administration. Since assuming office 
        two years ago, the current administration has sought to reverse almost 
        all of the major environmental initiatives promoted by the Clinton administration 
        and EPA, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Interior.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many of these rollbacks have included a withdrawal of the stricter arsenic 
        standards, the Roadless Rule to allow access to public forests, and reauthorization 
        of the Superfund Tax on Industry against hazardous output. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While Mazurek felt the current rollbacks to be crippling, she also found 
        the president's refusal to replace antiquated programs of policy with 
        modern strategies more troublesome. The current administration seemed 
        to overlook many strategies that would &quot;marry environmental gains 
        with more market-friendly approaches.&quot; She mentioned a lack of support 
        for modern advances in the arena of information technology as a major 
        drawback.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Mazurek found first generation laws of the &quot;command and control&quot; 
        form-once designed to highly specific sites and issues-were unable to 
        adapt to our changing society. She highlighted as examples, the Clean 
        Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the institution of &quot;scrubbers&quot; 
        on industrial outputs as all instances of first generation public policy 
        that worked, but simply could not address broader issues at the local 
        level. </p>
      <p align="left">
        At a time when Congress has no idea of agricultural run-off and the gradual 
        eutrophication of many lakes, she found such first generation laws now 
        to be somewhat outdated.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As a solution for the modernization of these laws, Mazurek found a more 
        market-based approach to be inevitable. She used the example of the Acid 
        Rain Program, which, unlike command and control systems, utilized a concept 
        of emissions trading, known as &quot;cap and trade,&quot; as an incentive 
        to reduce harmful levels of sulfur dioxide. The approach, a replacement 
        to more traditional &quot;scrubbers,&quot; also provided an economic incentive 
        to conserve energy and utilize more fuel-efficient power sources. Power 
        companies now attend a self-credited program. </p>
      <p align="left">
        She concluded that the ability to harness market-based tools with environmental 
        incentives would ultimately act as a vehicle for continued political agreement 
        leading into the twenty-first century.</p>
