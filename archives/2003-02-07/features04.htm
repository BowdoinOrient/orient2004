      <p align="left">Walter M. Bush of the Class of 1940 wrote President Sills 
        from basic training, describing the &quot;evils&quot; of &quot;K.P.&quot; 
        duty: &quot;I had K.P. once, and its evils are not exaggerated in the 
        least!&quot; From H. Philip Chapman, Jr. President Sills received news 
        of naval cadet training:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Our training at Quonset was an attempt to convert us from civilians into 
        well-trained naval officers in 60 days; to give us the high spots of four 
        years of Annapolis. There we learned the fundamentals of naval aviation 
        (since we were officers attached to aviation) the rudiments of seamanship, 
        navigation; the organization and regulations of the Navy, and the detailed 
        study of ships and planes. Quite a program! And a quiz a day to keep us 
        moving!</p>
      <p align="left">
        W. Streeter Bass, a graduate in the Class of 1938 wrote to Dean Nixon, 
        describing the weapons he was being trained to use:</p>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>
        I have now completed 4 weeks of training in a so-called &quot;heavy-weapons&quot; 
        company. This means that our principal weapons will be the heavy machine 
        gun and the 81 MM mortar. For the first 6 weeks, however, we study basic 
        rifle tactics, map-reading, grenade throwing, close and extended order 
        drill, scouting and patrolling, and in general &quot;what every soldier 
        should know.&quot; All (or nearly all) of this has been very interesting 
        to me. Army life in general is so utterly different from anything I've 
        ever known, that I am regarding the whole experience as a great eye-opener 
        and a thorough going lesson in the actions and reactions of the male animal 
        in the mass. The really disturbing factor, which I sometimes find it hard 
        to suppresses, is the realization that I am enrolled in a course of education 
        for death-not for life! I sometimes have the feeling that I am too highly 
        civilized ever to make a good soldier!</blockquote>
      <p align="left">
        Richard C. Johnstone reported to Dean Nixon on his Marine Corps training-often 
        considered the hardest and the roughest:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Our day starts at 6 A.M. and we are doing something until taps at 10 P.M. 
        and often until the lights on the head go out at 11 P.M.-that happens 
        only on the nights before exams when we all do a little last minute cramming. 
        This first month has been devoted mainly to courses on the more important 
        weapons and a rather rugged course in map reading. We have taken exams 
        in the M-1 rifle, carbine rifle, Browning machine guns, automatic rifle, 
        map reading, scouting and patrolling, and anti-aircraft defense.</blockquote>
      <p align="left">
        It must have given Paul Nixon a good laugh to learn from graduate Irving 
        Callman '44 that Bowdoin's physical training program-which had been reinforced 
        to train students for military service-was considered (by the author of 
        the letter, at least) to be even harder than the Marine Corps training 
        at Parris Island:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Naturally it is rugged but it is easier than I had expected. At times 
        Bowdoin's physical program was more strenuous than the Marine's; it has 
        been a tremendous value to me, and I hope that it is still in effect.</blockquote>
      <p align="left">
        Sometimes these letters were read to the students, still at Bowdoin, during 
        morning Chapel-perhaps as a lesson in what they might expect beyond the 
        College's walls. But the students who remained were sober and understood 
        the hardships that would lie ahead for them. These letters merely reinforced 
        their beliefs that a long hard war was ahead. </p>
      <p align="left">
        When Maine Governor, Sumner Sewall spoke in the Chapel and spun patriotic 
        stories, telling the students to have faith, Orient columnist Don Sears 
        replied bitingly:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Mr. Sewall professed, &quot;Faith carries us on and will see us through.&quot; 
        Faith can do that for the older generations, but for the youth of today 
        faith is an almost unknown quantity&#133;. We have no part of faith; since 
        we have seen our faith in brotherly love, in equal opportunity, in world 
        peace-each slowly torn to pieces. Faith and idealism-day-dreaming and 
        wishful-thinking-we want none of them, for they help us not at all and 
        they can hurt us infinitely.</blockquote>
      <p align="left">
        On Sunday, January 25, 1942, as Bowdoin College was preparing for its 
        first three-semester year and as its sons worldwide were facing the greatest 
        war in human history, Professors Stanley B. Smith and Frederic E. T. Tillotson 
        helped put together a special musical program to honor the 183rd anniversary 
        of the birth of Scottish poet Robert Burns. Among the songs that were 
        sung was one that had a special meaning for the large Bowdoin family that 
        was now parting for all corners of the world and all branches of the service. 
        As winter's dark evening turned to night on the chilly Maine day, faculty, 
        staff, and students gathered in the Moulton Union, amidst flickering lights 
        and great fears to sing a ballad of friendship:</p>
      <p align="left">
        <i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot?<br>
        And never brought to mind?<br>
        Should auld acquaintance be forgot?<br>
        And days o' lang syne?<br>
        For auld lang syne, my Dear<br>
        For auld lang syne<br>
        We'll tak a cup o kindness yet<br>
        For auld lang syne<br>
