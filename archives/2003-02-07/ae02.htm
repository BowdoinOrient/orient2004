            on National Public Radio, received many laughs from the audience.

      <p align="left">A small, gray man in a blue striped shirt and red suspenders 
        walked onto the stage. His jean trousers spoke of rural areas where old 
        men still sat in rocking chairs on their porches. His personage hinted 
        at places where the biggest gossip to tell was about the new neighbor 
        in town who didn't do all the things normal folk did and did some things 
        quite differently. The man's adopted persona was The Humble Farmer and 
        his business was making people laugh.</p>
      <p align="left">
        First thought: this comedian seems out of place, or, at least, out of 
        time. Second thought: he must be a dirty old man if he's prepared to make 
        a bunch of college students chuckle. In a way, both thoughts turned out 
        to be true. Laughter is often the result of seeing something unexpected 
        or incongruous with reality. In terms of typical college atmosphere, this 
        man was the very essence of incongruity. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He did not swear. He carried a hanky in his pocket. His sexual jokes were 
        often the equivalent of exchanging a &quot;nudge, nudge, wink, wink, say 
        no more&quot; with the audience. He lovingly referred to his wife as the 
        &quot;almost perfect woman.&quot; And, to top it off, the trusty old village 
        idiot was rolled out several times in his narrative-a particular man by 
        the name of &quot;Winky.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In short, The Humble Farmer was the equivalent of a kindly, gray haired, 
        grandfather who likes to tell jokes and hear people laugh. Strangely enough, 
        on a Friday evening, with the weekend debauchery to come (or already having 
        begun), this man out of time proved just the ticket to put a few homespun 
        stitches in the side. In short, he was irresistibly funny. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He started off by sharing a secret of his trade with the audience. Pulling 
        out a small pad of paper from a pocket in his jean pants, he flapped it 
        at the audience. &quot;I write everything that I hear that might be funny 
        down in this little note pad,&quot; he said, &quot;But, it's funny, 'cause 
        in New England, I am always writing stuff down, but in Florida I never 
        have the chance to pull it out and write something down. People just don't 
        say funny things in Florida.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The evening continued from there. His dry wit remained dry despite tears 
        of laughter from the audience and his timing never faltered. Perhaps the 
        most touching aspect of the evening was the fact that this prince of wit 
        enjoyed hearing the audience laugh just as much as the audience enjoyed 
        his anecdotes.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Robert Skoglund, as The Humble Farmer, airs every Friday night on National 
        Public Radio. Skoglund is also a renowned humorist and speaker. His home 
        is in St. George, Maine where he encourages anyone passing through to 
        drop in for a cookie. </p>
