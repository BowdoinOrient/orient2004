        <font size="2">ANDY CASHMAN</font><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Since the devastating Democratic defeat in November, many 
        people have been discussing the future of the Democratic Party. Last semester, 
        Todd Buell's column discussed the need for the Democrats to move ideologically 
        right. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Just last week, Patrick Rockefeller wrote that the party's extreme left 
        was hindering its appeal to many Americans. With so much advice from the 
        Republicans, it seems necessary for a Democrat to weigh in on the matter.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact is that our party has seen better days. We have lost the political 
        edge in Washington and, as many a political junkie will tell you, with 
        it, the American people. The problem, of course, arises from many factors. 
        Among these are poor party leadership, foggy ideology and policy, lack 
        of party participation and loyalty, and other contributing factors. However, 
        at the heart of each of these issues is a fundamental problem within our 
        party that must be corrected soon if we are to regain political power. 
        That problem is the splintering of the key interest groups within the 
        party.</p>
      <p align="left">
        These groups represent numerous interests ranging from women's rights 
        to affordable health care. It is just this diversity of interests that 
        makes the Democratic Party stronger and a good representation of the wide 
        array of people in our country. The Republicans, no matter what they may 
        say or whom they may quote, only represent the interests of the people 
        in the top five percent of income levels. This point was accentuated last 
        week when we learned that the key feature of Bush's tax plan was the elimination 
        of a tax on dividends.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Clearly, it is far easier to unite the interests of the few groups within 
        the Republican Party than it is to do the same with the more diverse interests 
        of the Democrats. However, without a clear coalition of these groups within 
        the Democratic Party, these groups, and the party itself, will lose any 
        ability to enact change that favors their interests.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Indeed, too many members of the party are focused exclusively on one or 
        two issues embraced by the Democrats. These people vote and volunteer 
        exclusively because of their interest in that particular topic. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a result, they may not vote for the party, but rather for a candidate, 
        Republican, or even Green, who plays to this interest. But when push comes 
        to shove, these candidates don't follow through with their promises. Did 
        an environmentalist who voted for Nader or Bush improve the quality of 
        our air or water? Certainly not; we're reducing the regulations on power 
        plant emissions. What about the pro-choice women who supported Bush, who, 
        as a compassionate conservative, &quot;wasn't that bad?&quot; Nope, they 
        saw Bush repeal funding early on for family planning abroad, a move that 
        threatened reproductive rights. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These problems could have been avoided had these groups better supported 
        the Democratic Party and elected someone who really would support their 
        interests.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In taking such a myopic approach to politics, these people threaten the 
        success of their own cause while undermining the strength of the Democratic 
        Party. It is only through a combined effort of all these interests that 
        real change may be enacted. Otherwise, each group will become ineffective 
        as they attempt redundant activities, and yield little lobbying power.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In conclusion, what the Democratic Party really needs is cooperation and 
        participation. The interest groups within the party need to sit down together 
        and work out an agreement to work together to better serve their own interests 
        and the good of the whole. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin will soon provide a model for this solution, as the social interest 
        groups on campus (including the Evergreens, Democrats, BWA, BGSA, and 
        others) will meet regularly to discuss and coordinate their efforts. May 
        this spirit of cooperation spread throughout our nation and breathe life 
        back into our party.</p>
