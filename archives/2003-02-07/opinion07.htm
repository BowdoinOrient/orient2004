        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> So let's assume that one of the hypothetical pickups I 
        discussed last week works for you. You got the in, had a sleepover, wrote 
        a few emails, had a couple of meals, and are now madly in love. Or, you 
        are still at that party and can't seem to make it back to your room. In 
        either case you may be tempted to engage in some public displays of affection. 
        Don't. In talking about such a crude subject, there is no nice way to 
        say it: PDA IS NOT OKAY.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Carrie agrees with me: &quot;I have been in relationships before. I have 
        been in love or in deep lust even. But in either case, it is fully unnecessary 
        to exhibit this to everyone else.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This is not to say that one should feel compelled to hide his or her relationship 
        with another. PDA is a far step from, say, being fined for sitting with 
        a girlfriend at lunch. And there are polite and decent ways to show one's 
        feelings. Sharing a meal with a loved one is not obnoxious. Holding hands 
        with said loved one: acceptable as well. Being so insistent on holding 
        hands with said loved one in line at said meal that people cannot get 
        to the toaster: unacceptable. Along the same lines: exchanging a look 
        at a party when someone mentions the restaurant you went to on your first 
        date is fine. Exchanging spit is not.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It seems to me that people engage in PDA for two reasons. One is because 
        they are just so absolutely enthralled with the person they are with that 
        they cannot bear to keep their hands off them. However, there are many 
        things that might be tempting to do in public that we do not. If you really 
        have to go to the bathroom on the way to a class, you would not stop and 
        do it in the middle of the quad. Likewise, no matter how much you enjoy 
        walking around naked after a shower, you would not walk around campus 
        naked. There is a private realm and a public realm and in advanced society, 
        we draw a line between the two. I am not talking about manners in the 
        sense of the orientation of your silverware but rather for the same reason 
        you would not subject your grandmother to an expletive-filled outburst, 
        you should not submit your fellow Bowdoin students to watch you make out 
        with somebody. And on those rare occasions that you really do forget yourself, 
        which of course may happen to even the best of us, you should be accordingly 
        mortified and apologize to those who had to witness.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Another explanation for PDA is that a person is so insecure that they 
        feel the need to make sure everyone around them knows that there actually 
        is someone out there who finds them attractive (at least for the moment). 
        These are the same people who will interrupt a conversation to whisper 
        and giggle to their boyfriend or girlfriend in such a conspicuous manner 
        that the rest of the group must watch and wait until the couple is done 
        or goes to find a bedroom. They might also be that couple who is so excited 
        their pickup worked that they go at it right then and there at a the party.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Dude,&quot; says Parker, &quot;I've had a girlfriend for two years. 
        I know we're going out. She knows we're going out. All our friends know 
        we're going out. No one needs to see it. That's like private stuff anyway.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Exactly, Parker. Private stuff. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I realize I am taking a drastic stance here, so I do not want it to be 
        misconstrued. I am not in any way criticizing love or lust. I am just 
        saying that I do not condone exhibitionism. Now repeat after me: PDA is 
        not okay.</p>
