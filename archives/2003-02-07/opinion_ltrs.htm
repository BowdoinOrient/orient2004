      <p align="left"><font size="5">Layoffs are not so easy to avoid</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors,</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the fact that I write a weekly column for the Orient, I have never 
        written a letter to the editors. If I were to write a letter, as I am 
        now, I would have at least some knowledge about the topic upon which I 
        chose write. This is in severe contrast to the two gentlemen who wrote 
        letters last week regarding the schools decision to lay off people. These 
        gentlemen's opinions on the matter are certainly not upsetting, but their 
        ridiculous claims and suggestions are.</p>
      <p align="left">
        First of all, both students suggested that we take money out of the endowment 
        to cover the budget shortfall. Although this may sound like an easy solution, 
        it is not. Funds cannot simply be taken from the endowment. Most donations 
        made to the school that compose the endowment are restricted. The money 
        that paid for the lights in Thorne Hall actually came from a restricted 
        donation for the artistic enhancement of Thorne and Chamberlain halls. 
        This means that most of the money in the endowment cannot be taken out 
        to help pay for employees' jobs. Furthermore, when taking money out of 
        the endowment, the College must consider its future and therefore the 
        endowments' ability to make money. Taking money out of it will hurt its 
        ability to make money in the future, as well as the stability of the College.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Secondly, the suggestion that we cancel various building projects around 
        campus is ridiculous. The money used to construct buildings comes from 
        money raised specifically for the building. These funds just cannot be 
        simply transferred to the different needs of the College.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Thirdly, the money spent on spring break trips for sports teams actually 
        comes from the students on the teams themselves. Students of various teams 
        run fundraisers throughout the year to help pay for their trips and other 
        expenses. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Fourth, these layoffs will have and effect on the surrounding community. 
        These layoffs, however, are outweighed by the good that Bowdoin does for 
        the surrounding community. The strength that Bowdoin brings to this community 
        is not primarily due to employment, but the money the school and students 
        spend in the community and the community service that students perform 
        in the surrounding community.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally, the thought to let the Chapel fall apart is truly appalling and 
        insulting. The Chapel is one of the cornerstones of our campus, it is 
        truly part of the feeling of the College. To say that Chapel is unused 
        is just wrong. The Chapel hosts weekly mass services and a few concerts 
        per year. Furthermore, the Chapel was, and will be, the site of many marriages 
        of Bowdoin students. The Chapel is one of the oldest buildings on campus 
        and not attending to it would be an injustice to the College.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Tim Riemer '03 <br>

      <p align="left"> To the Bowdoin community:</p>
      <p> This coming Valentine's Day, the V-Day organization would like to encourage 
        members of the Bowdoin community to spread their love to women around 
        the world who have been victims of violence. V-Day stands not only for 
        Valentine, but also for Vagina, anti-Violence, and most importantly, Victory. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        This year, V-Day events revolve around the theme of &quot;envisioning 
        a world without violence.&quot; Objectives are to raise awareness at Bowdoin 
        surrounding the issue of violence against women and to raise funds for 
        Sexual Assault Support Services of Midcoast Maine (SASSMM) and Family 
        Crisis Center, a Portland shelter for battered women. </p>
      <p align="left">
        We, the members of V-Day, invite students, faculty, and staff to participate 
        in the myriad of activities taking place during V-Week, February 10-14, 
        2003. Please help us meet our $6,000 goal through donations or purchases. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Our table in Smith Union will provide information about our cause and 
        accept donations. V-Day tee-shirts ($5) and underwear ($8 for women's 
        underwear, $8.50 for boxers) will also be on sale. Tickets for the Vagina 
        Monologues ($7 for students, faculty and staff, $10 for the public), which 
        will take place February 20-22 in Kresge Auditorium, will be on sale at 
        the Smith Union Info Desk. During V-Week, we will also be holding a raffle 
        for donated goods from local businesses.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The V-Day Coffeehouse and Art Show will celebrate student artists whose 
        work reflects women's issues. Actors, singers, writers, and dancers who 
        wish to perform at the February 13 Coffeehouse in Morrell Lounge may sign 
        up at the Smith Union Info Desk. We also invite you to attend the Art 
        Show opening in Lamarche Lounge on the evening of February 14. Yummy baked 
        goods and drinks will be offered at both of these events, and donations 
        will be accepted. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To obtain statistics regarding sexual assault at Bowdoin, V-Day will be 
        distributing surveys to your mailboxes. We encourage you to fill them 
        out, fold them in half, and put them in campus mail, where they will be 
        directed to the Women's Resource Center. We will inform the community 
        of our findings as soon as we compile the results.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Please help us achieve our goal of increased awareness and funds for SASSMM 
        and Family Crisis Center. With your help, we can realize our vision of 
        a world without violence.<br>
        <br>
