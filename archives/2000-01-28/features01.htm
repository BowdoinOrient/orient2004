        in the army of the Potomac</font><br>

      <p align="left">Ambrose Everett Burnside succeeded George McClellan to the 
        command of the Union Army of the Potomac late in the fall of 1862. Burnside 
        inherited a well fought army- an army which had just recently pushed Robert 
        E. Lee's advancing rebel Army of Northern Virginia back across the Potomac 
        River, thus ending their stay on northern soil. Within the ranks of that 
        veteran and luckless Army of the Potomac was the 20th Maine Volunteer 
        Infantry Regiment along with its Lieutenant Colonel, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 
        Class of 1852, and up until joining the Union cause, a professor of language 
        and religion.</p>
      <p align="left">Submitting a leave of absence, Chamberlain answered Lincoln's 
        cry for more troops and left his home and college for the adventure of 
        a lifetime. His first taste of war was one of blood, smoke and horror. 
        Chamberlain saw for himself the great battle of Antietam. And although 
        his regiment did not participate in any other way than to run away from 
        Lee's tough rear guard, Chamberlain still found the war that he had sought. 
        Now with a new commander and a new campaign underway, Chamberlain would 
        live through one of the worst nights of his life on a field littered with 
        dead bodies.</p>
      <p align="left">Ambrose Burnside, although not as popular as his predecessor, 
        was accepted as the new commander of the army. He had already proven his 
        military incompetence at Antietam where he sent his men into a slaughter 
        at what is forever remembered as 'Burnside's bridge'. He was inept and 
        surely no military genius, but Lincoln felt differently and gave him command 
        anyway.</p>
      <p align="left">Burnside moved fast and pushed his men harder than George 
        McClellan ever did. He impressed everyone when he out-raced Lee to the 
        town of Falmouth, on the north bank of the Rappahannock River, just across 
        from Fredericksburg, Virginia.</p>
      <p align="left">Burnside's plan was to move on Richmond, the Confederate 
        capital, as fast as possible, and the route he chose led through Fredericksburg. 
        Burnside's grand plans for a swift campaign, however, ran aground when 
        he realized that the pontoon bridges, which he required for crossing the 
        Rappahannock, had not arrived with the army.</p>
      <p align="left">Instead of crossing upstream where the river was fordable 
        and occupying Fredericksburg, Burnside set camp and waited for his essential 
        pontoons on the opposite side of the river. Burnside waited more than 
        a month for his bridges. In the meantime, Lee arrived and fortified the 
        heights around Fredericksburg., which Burnside had failed to seize. </p>
      <p align="left">During this time, Chamberlain continued to train with his 
        men. Their colonel, Adelbert Ames, had taken it upon himself to turn the 
        20th Maine into the best regiment in the whole army. Through November 
        and into early December, the Maine men drilled and drilled. Finally, after 
        weeks of waiting, Burnside decided the time had come to attack the enemy 
        to his front. His strategy was no doubt a product of weeks of deep thought 
        and planning. His idea was simple: charge head on into an enemy which 
        had fortifications on high ground.</p>
      <p align="left">On December 13, 1862, the men of the Army of the Potomac, 
        their flags unfurled, their uniforms crisp, their weapons sparkling in 
        the morning sun, set out as if to march in a grand review. They lined 
        up neatly against the backdrop of the Fredericksburg heights and prepared 
        to advance. As the signal came, the men marched forward into hell. Fire 
        from cannon, muskets and canister tore apart divisions, brigades, regiments 
        and companies. Men wounded, dying, cried in agony.</p>
      <p align="left">The Confederates had placed their artillery in key positions 
        and lined up their defenses with precise and deadly effect on the Union 
        men. It was a nightmare, but still Burnside sent in more and more men. 
        Chamberlain and the 20th Maine advanced with their comrades in the Fifth 
        Corps at around three in the afternoon. Their objective was to reach a 
        stone wall held by Confederate sharpshooters at the base of a place called 
        Marye's Heights. Showing perfect coordination and discipline, the Maine 
        men advanced into the face of fire from all around.</p>
      <p align="left">Chamberlain later remembered that they advanced &quot;over 
        fences and through hedges, over bodies of dead men and living ones.&quot; 
        The regiment took its punishment and came to a rest within sight of its 
        objective. Those few hours before dusk were hell as the Confederate fire 
        kept the Union men firmly hugging the ground. </p>
      <p align="left">Chamberlain found a comfortable spot to spend the night 
        in between two lifeless bodies. He used another body to cushion his head. 
        All around him there were men, living and dead. And although they were 
        still alive, the living suffered immensely mroe than the dearly departed. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The night was freezing cold, and the Confederates never 
        rested. Chamberlain, as he fell asleep between bodies, was roused by someone 
        thinking him dead too. With a word from him, the would-be thief ran off 
        into the night.</p>
      <p align="left">Chamberlain tried to sleep again, but the sound of bullets 
        all around him and the haunting cries of suffering men kept him awake. 
        Joshua Chamberlain had come to find war, and now amidst a field of death 
        and destruction, the secrets of war had been unleashed into his mind forever. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The next day at sunset, Chamberlain's men were finally given 
        the signal to withdraw. The Battle of Fredericksburg was over, and the 
        Union had once again suffered a major defeat. Chamberlain was glad to 
        see that his regiment was more or less still intact. The 20th Maine had 
        proven itself in battle at last. They were now veterans. Battered and 
        worn, the Army of the Potomac slipped across the Rappahannock and went 
        back to its camps around the town of Falmouth.</p>
      <p align="left">There it stayed until Burnside, with another brainstorm, 
        decided to cross the river upstream and come down on Lee from the rear. 
        He set out on January 20 on what was to be yet another doomed experiment. 
        This time, however, it was not the Confederates but fate that spoiled 
        Burnside's grand design. Rain poured down in torrents, turning dirt roads 
        into deep, impassable mud. Burnside gave up his expedition and returned 
        his demoralized army to their camps four days after they had set out.</p>
      <p align="left">Thus began a period of waiting for the men of the 20th Maine. 
        They saw no action in the Chancellorsville campaign in the May of 1863 
        due to quarantine, placed upon them because the regiment had been given 
        defective smallpox, apparently triggering numerous cases among the men. 
        Chamberlain was furious about not being able to fight with the rest of 
        the army.</p>
      <p align="left">He rode up to the headquarters himself and reportedly said, 
        &quot;If we couldn't do anything else, we could give the enemy the smallpox.&quot; 
        Finally given the duty of protecting some telegraph lines, Chamberlain 
        was content. In the fight that occured, Burnside's successor, Joeseph 
        Hooker, failed once again to annihilate Lee's forces, now reduced in number 
        to almost one third the size of the Union Army. </p>
      <p align="left">After two massive defeats, morale in the Union Army was 
        low. Outgeneraled and outfought wherever it went, the men nearly lost 
        faith in their cause. What was needed was a decisive victory. Joshua Chamberlain 
        came to the war to see what he could do to help.</p>
      <p align="left">At Fredericksburg he had seen the very face of battle, and 
        that face was one of death. Now as he waited with his men for another 
        commander to come along and lead them to another doomed offensive, Robert 
        E. Lee slipped past the Union flank and again invaded the North.</p>
      <p align="left">His goal this time was to move deep into enemy country, 
        and draw the Army of the Potomac to one last fight. His journey would 
        lead him through Maryland and into Pennsylvania where he would collide 
        with the boys in blue at a little-known town in Gettysburg.</p>
