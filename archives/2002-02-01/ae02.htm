      <p> After a full semester of practicing, waiting, and practicing a few more 
        times, the Bowdoin Brahms Trio will finally perform at this Friday's Lunchbreak 
        Concert at 12:30 p.m. in Gibson 101.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Composed of Samantha Altschuler '04, Andrew King '04, and David Sohn'04, 
        the three will perform the second movement of Brahms' Trio for cello, 
        piano, and clarinet. This is a piece the group has rehearsed together 
        for months, and now they are finally getting the chance to display their 
        talent in front of an audience. Says Altschuler of the piece, &quot;We 
        decided that we'd worked on it hard enough and wanted to perform.&quot; 
        Altschuler, who has studied the cello since age four, has performed in 
        several chamber ensembles at Bowdoin and will play a Copland sextet in 
        the spring with several other string players. <br>
      </p>
      <p>King's 12 years of experience on the piano has enabled him to play a 
        wide variety of composers and pieces, and he is enthusiastic about the 
        selection and the composer. &quot;It's really kind of heartwrenching&#133;it's 
        very pretty. It's a chamber piece, so we're all kind of interacting musically 
        with each other.&quot; On Brahms he noted, &quot;He tended to play a lot 
        with rhythms. This is one of the last pieces he wrote&#133;it was written 
        in the 1890s at some point.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Music Department's Lunchbreak Concerts provide many opportunities 
        for Bowdoin students, faculty, and outside performers to put their talents 
        on display. Past concerts have included student performances on instruments 
        from guitar to piano to tuba, as well as selections from faculty compositions 
        and student recitals. This Friday's concert will feature, along with the 
        Trio, Professor Jim McCalla performing several of Professor Elliott Schwartz's 
        piano compositions. Also, Lana Klemeyer '02 will sing several selections 
        as a preview for her upcoming March voice recital. <br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the appealing aspects of the Lunchbreak Concert is the informality 
        of the affair. Audience members often bring bag lunches and Gibson 101, 
        typically used as a rehearsal room, is a laid-back space in which students 
        can perform without the pressures of more formal venues. However, in terms 
        of opportunities for musicians to showcase their talents, many students 
        and faculty members have voiced the clear need for a concert hall on Bowdoin's 
        campus. While Pickard Theater is wonderfully equipped for the uses of 
        dramatic productions, it has some of the worst acoustics on campus-especially 
        for vocal groups. The building that houses Curtis Pool has long been targeted 
        as the site for Bowdoin's next concert venue, but these plans have yet 
        to come to fruition. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, the Bowdoin Music Department has done an excellent job 
        in making use of other spaces around campus for performances. It has also 
        created ample opportunities for Bowdoin's student musicians to share their 
        talents with the community. </p>
