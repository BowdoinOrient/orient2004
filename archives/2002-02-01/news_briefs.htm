      <p><b>Pope calls on Roman Catholic laywers to halt divorce</b><br>
        In a move that sent shockwaves through the Italian legal community, Pope 
        John Paul II suggested last Monday that divorce could be ebbed if Roman 
        Catholic lawyers refused to take on divorce cases. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Italians feel that their legal rights might be in jeopardy if lawyers 
        were to follow through with the Pope's wishes. Instead of jumping to legal 
        measures, the Pope stressed the importance of seeking guidance within 
        the church.</p>
      <p><b>Bush calls for action on patients' right bill, new HMO practices</b><br>
        In attempts to revise the current state of national health care, President 
        Bush asked for bipartisan support of the patients' right bill. Included 
        in his proposals is the controversial idea of adding prescription drugs 
        to the Medicare package. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bush has proposed the spending of $77 billion in the next ten years to 
        adequately meet the medical needs of elderly Americans, especially those 
        who fall below the $13,000 poverty line.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This Republican approach to national health care is likely to meet controversy 
        in Congress.</p>
      <p><b>San Francisco airport evacuated after bomb scare</b><br>
        San Francisco International Airport was evacuated Wednesday morning after 
        a passenger's shoes indicated the presence of RDX, an explosive found 
        in ammunition and lawn fertilizer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As a protective measure, airport officials evacuated the airport in hopes 
        of locating the man. Bomb teams swept the airport, but all searches were 
        inconclusive. <br>
      </p>
      <p>According to reports, when the security screener saw that the explosives 
        test had turned up positive, he went to alert his supervisor, thus leaving 
        the man and his shoes unattended.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It appears as if the man, who had been selected for a random search, 
        thought that he had cleared security, and then proceeded to board his 
        flight. By the time security personnel was alerted of the incident, the 
        man had slipped into the crowd of passengers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This incident, given the great inconvenience and expense that ensued, 
        has raised further questions about the competence and qualifications of 
        airport security.</p>
      <p><b>Bush addresses the nation</b><br>
        On Tuesday night, President Bush delivered his first State of the Union 
        address. Not surprisingly, he pledged to continue fighting the war on 
        terrorism, calling upon all Americans to play a more active role in strengthening 
        our nation. Ideally, he said, each American should pledge two years, or 
        4,000 hours of service to volunteer organizations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bush spoke words of encouragement, suggesting that our nation, despite 
        hardships throughout the past few months, is at its pinnacle of strength. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>In his address, Bush did not address the current Enron situation, nor 
        did he speak the name Osama bin Laden. Bush hinted towards increasing 
        military action in the potential terrorist nations of Iraq, Iran, and 
        North Korea. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the many somber issues addressed in his speech, Bush managed 
        to promote a sense of optimism and American strength. </p>
      <p><b>BIW could soon begin work on destroyers</b><br>
        In what appears to be a sign of the times, Bath Iron Works is contemplating 
        a shift in production that would mean the building of Naval Destroyers, 
        lending their current contract for the production of other naval ships 
        to Ingalls Shipyard of Pascagoula, Mississippi.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The current contract consisted of 12 amphibious assault vessels, eight 
        of which were to be built in Pascagoula, four of which were to be constructed 
        by Bath Iron Works. By placing the order for all 12 ships in the hand 
        of once contractor, the Navy aims to save money on the production of these 
        ships. </p>
      <p><b>Bates appoints new president</b><br>
        The single-sex beginnings of Bates College were updated once again last 
        week as Elaine Tuttle Hansen was selected as the seventh president of 
        the fellow NESCAC school. Hansen comes from Haveford College in Pennsylvania, 
        where she has taught English since 1980. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The single-sex beginnings of Bates College were updated once again last

        the fellow NESCAC school. Hansen comes from Haveford College in Pennsylvania, 
        where she has taught English since 1980. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Retiring from his post as president of Bates is Donald Harward, who has 
        held that position for 13 years. When Hansen is inaugurated next fall, 
        she will become the second woman to serve as president of a NESCAC school.</p>
      <p><b>Amidst uncertainty, Harvard hires African American Prof.</b><br>
        Harvard, which boasts one of the strongest Afro-American studies departments 
        in the nation, has been faced with a great deal of uncertainty as Princeton 
        threatens to draw away more of their well-regarded professors. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Among those considering leaving Harvard for Princeton are chairman of 
        the Afro-American studies program Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Dr. Cornel 
        West. These considerations of departure come in the wake of black philosophy 
        professor, K. Anthony Appiah's decision to accept Princeton's offer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Many are attributing this trend to the questionable affirmative action 
        policies of newly inaugurated president Lawrence H. Summers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Recently acquired in the midst of the controversy, however, is Michael 
        C. Dawson who currently serves as director of the University of Chicago's 
        Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture. Once at Harvard, 
        Dawson will serve as a professor of Afro-American studies and government.
