      <p align="left"><font size="5">A solution to Bowdoin's dating and political 
        apathy problems</font><br>
        <font size="2">DANIEL BUCKLEY<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>It has become apparent to me as a reader of the <i>Orient</i> that Bowdoin, 
        despite its idyllic image as the bucolic small college in Maine, does 
        have its share of problems. According to the opinion section, these pressing 
        issues include, and are not limited to: the dysfunctional nature of students' 
        romantic lives, an overly liberal student body, and the entire school's 
        tendency to neglect traditional American/Anglo-Saxon values. The list 
        goes on, but I am limited in this article to some 600 words (82 down, 
        518 to go).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mercifully enough, the Orient is not the sole purveyor of news and opinion 
        for Bowdoin students. Most students will flip through the pages of a major 
        newspaper or magazine at some point during the week. Yet besides those 
        pinko-commies printing the disorient, it is the Orient that enlightens 
        the community to the campus goings-on. Supplemented monthly by the always-hilariously 
        Patriot (brilliant political satire in there), the Orient primarily fills 
        the void of Bowdoin print media.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Still, even with this trio of Bowdoin publications, no one has been heretofore 
        able to solve the problems of a lackluster dating scene or a serious bankruptcy 
        in reactionary political conservatism. Indeed, these are challenging issues. 
        But I believe that combining the two problems-rather than tackling them 
        separately-will yield an interesting solution to Bowdoin's most important 
        issues.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In order to alleviate the awkward situations Bowdoin students encounter 
        daily with the opposite sex and to rejuvenate the political right on campus, 
        I recommend that the College consider admitting only male applicants, 
        becoming, once again, an all-male liberal arts college in four years' 
        time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now, we would have to do something about the classification &quot;liberal 
        arts college,&quot; but that's another column; hear me out. By relegating 
        our current female students to a different school, perhaps constructing 
        a [Harriet Beecher] Stowe College (a la Radcliffe and Harvard of old), 
        we can ease the inter-gender tension by strictly limiting coeducationally 
        structured time. The women will attend one campus, the men the other. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>With all the problems of dating older/younger students, and deciding 
        when to break up or stay together, it would make much more sense to simply 
        schedule times, on the weekends, for men and women to intermingle: at 
        a hockey game, a social house party or a formal school event. By limiting 
        the amount of time men and women interact, you can likewise limit the 
        amount of awkwardness that each Bowdoin students feels upon contacting 
        the opposite sex. Clearly, brief and closely chaperoned events in which 
        all the social and sexual needs of young adults must be met would be tension-free 
        when compared to the miserable, inherently awkward situation of asking 
        a classmate-a person one sees almost every day-for a quick cup of coffee.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The most attractive facet of this decentralization of the sexes is that 
        it practically solves the political &quot;liberality&quot; of the College 
        by itself. Prior to 1970, Bowdoin existed as a distinguished all-male 
        liberal arts school. Educating future leaders was simpler then: less minorities 
        were represented on campus, there were obviously no females present, and 
        the College apparently had no problem with its typecast as the &quot;old 
        moneyed New Englanders'&quot; small school of choice. With this rampant 
        yet delightful homogeneity once again reinstituted, Bowdoin students could 
        get back to what's important: celebrating those forgotten figures like 
        Jefferson or Washington, or debating how-not if-it is best to neo-colonialize 
        the Third World in our own image. The political and traditional implications 
        for an exclusive group of wealthy, all-white males of Anglo-Saxon stock 
        (OK, we'll take most Northern Europeans) are all too clear to require 
        further explanation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, the establishment of an all-female &quot;Stowe College&quot; 
        is clearly justified. It just may be the solution that both the College's 
        conservatives and single Bowdoin students need. Maybe there's even a connection: 
        conservative&#133;and&#133;single&#133;?</p>
