        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p>There was some Southern Californian sun shining in Bowdoin's Kresge Auditorium 
        earlier this week in a pair of lectures depicting the contemporary art 
        worlds of Los Angeles and New York. Guest lecturer and visiting artist 
        Tom Krupuk is an abstract painter and professor at California State University, 
        Long Beach. He is also a friend and former colleague of the art department's 
        Professor Mark Wethli. Krupuk spoke at an animated, quick pace, and occasionally 
        used different voices and added poetry. Both of the lengthy lectures were 
        jam-packed with images and were easy to follow. Krumpak showed slides 
        of both locations and works of other artists currently living and exhibiting 
        in New York and Los Angeles. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Krumpak's first lecture, entitled &quot;Cool, Calm and Loco: Los Angeles 
        art in the 21st Century,&quot; examined the art in Los Angeles through 
        a series of more than 300 slides of artwork and images of the city itself. 
        He took the audience from Santa Monica to South Central L.A., then over 
        to Chinatown and into West Hollywood, without neglecting popular attractions 
        such as Disneyland, Knox Berry Farm and Las Vegas-places that have a strong 
        influence on Los Angeles even though they are not actually located in 
        the city. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Krupuk took the audience on a tour from gallery to gallery, looking at 
        art and the influences on the artists making the art. Krumpak described 
        L.A. as a combination, or cross, between hell and paradise, and how the 
        city, along with other influences such as drugs, cars and large ethnic 
        populations, impacts the current art scene. Krupuk spoke about all aspects 
        of life in L.A. from food to drinking to scenery and culture, and his 
        slides showed both figurative and abstract works. Each work, in its own 
        way, spoke about life in Los Angeles.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Krumpak's lecture on the following evening, entitled &quot;On street, 
        under bridge, in caf&eacute;: art seen in New York 99-02,&quot; addressed 
        the art scene in New York City. Krupuk delivered this lecture with the 
        same level of enthusiasm as the first, and this virtual tour traveled 
        not only to galleries, but also to many restaurants and local hang-outs. 
        He showed slides from the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea and MoMA' 
        s P.S. 1 Center for Contemporary Art in Long Island City. He began with 
        the galleries on 57th Street, headed downtown to Broadway and Chelsea, 
        and then to the West and East Villages. Finally the tour displayed aspects 
        of both Queens and Brooklyn, two quickly emerging centers for art and 
        artists because, as Krupuk put it, &quot;There is no way any artist would 
        be able to afford to live and work in Manhattan.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the span of two nights, Tom Krupuk gave Bowdoin two extremes of the 
        American art world. He introduced the art and culture of both coasts, 
        took the audience to two vastly different, highly populated, multi-cultured 
        cities, and showed the art that is being produced, made, marketed and 
        enjoyed in each. </p>
