        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL<br>
        ORIENT STAFF </font></p>
      <p align="left">It's difficult to remain objective when talking about the 
        men's hockey team this week. The Bears (13-0-3, 10-0-3 NESCAC) are cleaning 
        up the league this season, and currently siting at #4 in national Division 
        III rankings as the only undefeated team in ANY division of college hockey.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men have remained unbeaten in all 16 games they've played 
        this season. Bowdoin record books haven't ever seen this kind of success-and 
        men's hockey has been a varsity sport since 1919.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tonight, the Bears will attempt to extend this successes 
        against Norwich, a team that promises to bring some stiff competition.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, head coach Terry Meagher refused to make more of 
        Norwich's #2 spot in the national rankings than he usually would. &quot;I 
        think that every game is big,&quot; he said. &quot;We're still taking 
        it one practice, one game at a time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">OK, all right, fine. No need to get excited here, one game 
        at a time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men visited Trinity last Friday, and came away with 
        a 2-1 win after a tight matchup. &quot;I'm very proud of our team and 
        how we played that game,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We saw some adversity, 
        but were patient and poised during those times.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Bill Busch found the back of the Bantam net at 12:36 
        in the first period. He was followed by junior Albert Mayer's goal at 
        8:34 in the second, and the Bowdoin lead stood at 2-0 until Trinity's 
        Thomas Pierandi netted one, bringing the total to 2-1.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Trinity was not only crucial, but it was a very good 
        game,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;To be tested this time of the year is 
        very important.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A trip to Wesleyan on Saturday ended in Bear victory as 
        well, this time by a much larger margin. However, Meagher said that the 
        11-1 final score didn't quite reflect the game's early dynamics.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was a very good game in the first period; it could 
        have gone either way,&quot; he said. &quot;After a while, it started to 
        go for us and we got into the rhythm of the game.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior captain Mike Carosi and sophomore Chris Pelletier 
        each had a goal and three assists, and a number of other Bowdoin players 
        contributed to the 11-1 score. Healey and Dave Sandals '05 combined to 
        make 23 saves for the Bears.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Junior Brian Shuman was selected as NESCAC Player of the 
        Week after his defensive and offensive efforts over the weekend, which 
        included two goals and two assists at Wesleyan.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Several factors seem to be tipping the scales in Bowdoin's 
        favor against recent opponents like Williams, Trinity, and Wesleyan. Offensive 
        production, a part of the game that the men have struggled with in past 
        years, was cited by Meagher early on in the season as important to the 
        team's development. According to him, the men have improved in this area.<br>
        &quot;We're not a natural goal-scoring team,&quot; he said. &quot;Our 
        goals have to come from the fundamentals-shots on net, positioning, mindset&#133;It's 
        something [the players] are still working on, and we're doing well with 
        that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher also said that predictions about the Bowdoin defense 
        have proved true. &quot;The defense was cited as the strength of our team 
        going into the season, and they've certainly lived up to that,&quot; he 
        said. &quot;Collectively, everyone's game has improved.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the Bears' last line of defense, sophomore goaltender 
        Mike Healey has been steady in net all season. &quot;Mike's playing a 
        very quiet goal; he settles the team,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;In any 
        goal sport, you've got to have that kind of play. [The men] enjoy playing 
        in front of him; they believe in him.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that he was looking forward to tonight's 7:00 
        p.m. matchup with Norwich. &quot;They're special in a way, because there 
        are some programs that Bowdoin has connected with over the years, and 
        they're definitely one of them,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">St. Michael's College, a new member of the Bears' league, 
        visits Dayton tomorrow for an afternoon game. According to Meagher, they 
        may bring some tough play as well. &quot;They're very well-coached, very 
        strong in goal, and they have some impressive wins in their results,&quot; 
        he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One thing the men seem to be looking forward to is the chance 
        to play at home for the first time in a long while. &quot;We're home in 
        front of the student body for the first time since December 1, so that's 
        exciting,&quot; Meagher said. <br>
        So put down the reading that you &quot;should&quot; do, get out to Dayton 
        tonight and tomorrow, and support your undefeated Bears!<br>
