        ORIENT STAFF </font></p>
      <p align="left">In order to collect student opinion on the possibility of 
        instituting a plus/minus grading system, the Recording Committee and Student 
        Government co-sponsored a forum Monday evening at Ladd House to discuss 
        the pros and cons of changing the grading system. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Approximately 35 people, including nine members of the Recording 
        Committee, attended the forum. Students asked the Recording Committee 
        members questions about the plus/minus system, and the Recording Committee 
        listened to students express their opinions so that the Committee would 
        be able to present those views at the March faculty meeting.<br>

            members of the Recording Committee, listens to student input on the

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Once concern voiced by a number of students at the forum 
        was the lack of student representation in making such a major academic 
        decision. One student said that a number of his friends had chosen not 
        to come to the forum because they felt that their opinion would not make 
        any difference in the outcome. The student expressed concern that the 
        Faculty seemed to be voting on the subject too quickly, and that a proposal 
        for such a change should originate within the student body, not within 
        the Faculty.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The student said he believed that since the vote was already 
        going to the Faculty, it seemed to make little difference as to what he 
        or his friends thought about the matter, since he felt that the faculty 
        members would vote the way they felt would best serve them, as opposed 
        to voting the way the students wanted. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He also said that he felt that if a student-body vote showed 
        a narrow majority leaning in one direction, because of the small margin, 
        the faculty would not take the student vote seriously.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Stephen Naculich, chair of the Recording Committee and assistant 
        professor of physics, said that both students and faculty have been pressuring 
        the committee to make a change to a plus/minus system. He cited potential 
        graduate school advantages as one of the reasons. In addition, Naculich 
        said he felt that such a change would help the faculty grade more accurately.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Faculty do agonize more over the grades now because 
        there's a perception of a bigger difference between an 'A' and a 'B,'&quot; 
        Naculich said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A number of students at the forum pointed out that while 
        the proposed system would help a few students, it would also hurt others.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Naculich said, &quot;I don't think we see it as helping 
        or hurting [students]. We see it as being potentially a more accurate 
        representation.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Susan Livesay, director of health professions advising, 
        said that for students whose grades are split between &quot;As&quot; and 
        &quot;Bs,&quot; the plus/minus system would likely have little effect 
        on their GPA. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But for students with mostly &quot;Bs&quot; who are intending 
        to apply to graduate school, under the current system, their GPA is around 
        3.0, which is too low for serious consideration by graduate schools. However, 
        students on a plus/minus system who get &quot;B+s&quot; have a GPA around 
        3.3, which is a great advantage.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In response to a question about the proposed grading system's 
        effect on grade inflation (see <a href="../2002-01-25/features.htm">last 
        week's</a> <i>Orient</i>), Naculich said that the system would not likely 
        have much of an effect in either reducing or encouraging inflation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many students expressed concern that switching to a plus/minus 
        system would increase the emphasis on grades, making the academic environment 
        more stressful and competitive.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One student said, &quot;One of the reasons I came to Bowdoin 
        was because of the whole non-focus on scores.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another student expressed concern that a plus/minus system 
        would lead to more students attempting to finagle their grade from a &quot;B+&quot; 
        to an &quot;A-,&quot; for example, whereas professors are currently less 
        likely to make such changes when the jump is from a &quot;B&quot; to an 
        &quot;A.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another student said that it simply would not be possible 
        for a professor to divide students into all of the categories of grades 
        offered by a plus/minus system, especially in discussion classes where 
        students essentially either participate a great deal, participate somewhat, 
        participate a little, or never participate. He questioned how a professor 
        would be able to distinguish between a &quot;B&quot; and a &quot;B+&quot; 
        student.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another student said, &quot;I don't really see how faculty 
        members would be able to tell the difference between a 'B' and a 'B+' 
        and do it fairly and not have it based on something that's not relevant.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Currently, an &quot;A&quot; is defined on transcripts as 
        evidence that the student has &quot;mastered the material of the course 
        and has demonstrated exceptional critical skills and originality.&quot; 
        It is not clear how pluses and minuses would be defined under the proposed 
        grading system.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another concern that many students had was the idea of switching 
        grading systems in the middle of their Bowdoin careers. They said they 
        felt that it would not be fair for students who came to Bowdoin precisely 
        because of the current grading system to be forced into a plus/minus system.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The decision to come to Bowdoin for the students who 
        are currently here was partly based on the method of the grading system, 
        and I think by switching halfway through, it kind of changes the reasoning 
        and the atmosphere&#133;of what we signed on to,&quot; said one student.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many students also said they felt that making a grading 
        scale change primarily to help students applying to graduate school discounted 
        the purpose of the grades while attending Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One student said, &quot;As someone who's not really looking 
        at grad school, I'm kind of annoyed that it comes down to the fact of 
        what's after Bowdoin as opposed to what is Bowdoin.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Others also expressed a fear that the motivation to move 
        to pluses and minuses was to institutionalize Bowdoin and make it like 
        other colleges, rather than allowing it to remain an individual institution 
        committed to not emphasizing grades.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Faculty members who were in favor of switching to a plus/minus 
        system said they felt that such a system would actually decrease the stress 
        students felt as a result of grades, because the difference between an 
        &quot;A-&quot; and a &quot;B+&quot; would be 0.4 points, as opposed to 
        the current one-point difference between an &quot;A&quot; and a &quot;B.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some students also said they felt that competitiveness would 
        not be a problem with the proposed system. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'd like to think that Bowdoin isn't really a competitive 
        environment amongst ourselves. I don't feel competitive with other students, 
        but I do want to be competitive with students on a national level. And 
        I don't think that switching to a plus/minus grading system is going to 
        make someone&#133;not tell you what the homework assignment is&#133;.I 
        don't think we attract that quality in students,&quot; said one student.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Livesay in health professions advising said that a number 
        of other colleges had actually switched to a plus/minus system in an effort 
        to reduce competitiveness.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Marilyn Reizbaum, professor of English, said that she thought 
        a switch to plus/minus would make it easier on grad schools since our 
        grading system would be in the same &quot;language&quot; as other colleges. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Reizbaum also said she felt that a plus/minus system would 
        allow for more &quot;nuances&quot; in grading. Instead of simply giving 
        a majority of students &quot;Bs,&quot; a professor would be able to differentiate 
        between the &quot;B+&quot; and the &quot;B-&quot; students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A number of students also felt that their current transcripts 
        did not reflect the students that they actually were, because many of 
        them had earned &quot;B+&quot; grades while only &quot;Bs&quot; were reported.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few alternatives to the plus/minus system were also suggested. 
        One student said that an opportunity to give pluses, without the accompanying 
        minuses, would help students who deserved it, but would not hurt others.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another student suggested staying with the current grading 
        system, but to help students applying to graduate school, a numerical 
        GPA that reflected a plus/minus system could be calculated in addition. 
        She said that most professors do already distinguish somewhat between 
        plus and minus grades, so making such a transition would not be difficult.</p>
