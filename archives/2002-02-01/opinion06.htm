        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Picture this: It is approximately 10:00 a.m. on a weekend morning. Much 
        of the student body is fast asleep, having gone to bed only hours earlier. 
        Some are out jogging or in the gym. Many other students with games that 
        day, or who have a lot of work, or who did not go out the previous night 
        are enjoying brunch. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And then there are those seen wearing the same clothes they wore last 
        night, makeup smeared, hair a mess, darting behind trees and building, 
        taking circuitous paths to avoid being noticed. But they inevitably will 
        be. <br>
        Who are these young men and women stumbling on the icy paths and what 
        on earth are they doing? Well, these fine upstanding Polar Bears are participating 
        in a time-honored college ritual: THE WALK OF SHAME.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Walkers are students who hooked up the night before, slept over and 
        now must make it back to their dorm before anyone who might have seen 
        them that night is awake. Not to be confused by anyone else milling around 
        campus that morning, they are easily identified. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Men have a horrible case of bed-head, half-closed eyes and severe stale-beer-breath. 
        Women are teetering in heels with raccoon-eyes and hair in messy ponytails. 
        They refuse to make eye contact with anyone. If, by some cruel twist of 
        fate, they happen to meet a fellow Walker on the path, they will not look 
        at each other and will never mention the meeting in conversation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Walk is particularly unfortunate following evenings with special 
        dress. The morning after last Halloween, Bob had to rush home to avoid 
        being seen in the fishnet stockings, tiny dress, and stuffed bra that 
        he had worn the night before. The costume had seemed like a good idea 
        when he and his friends were all doing it together, confidence boosted 
        by alcohol. But walking home alone and sober the next morning took away 
        some of the fun. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Carrie recalls a long trek last year after the Spring Gala from Brunswick 
        Apartments to the freshman dorms. &quot;There I was, in a full-length 
        strapless dress, freezing cold, walking barefoot down Maine Street with 
        my shoes in hand, because there was no way I could stand for one more 
        second in those heels. And the worst part was, I knew I hadn't hooked 
        up with anyone the night before-I just spent the night at friends' apartment-but 
        I knew that everyone I saw would assume I had!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The thing about the Walk that makes it so particular, is that generally, 
        when one spends the night at a boyfriend or girlfriend's house, there 
        are clothes and toothbrushes to be borrowed (or even your own that you 
        keep there) and even more importantly, someone who you know will drive 
        you home or to brunch. This is why the Walk is usually reserved for those 
        mornings after random hookups where you feel extraordinarily uncomfortable 
        and feel the need to leave as soon as you wake up. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some say that the Walk of Shame is just retribution for one's actions 
        the night before. But that's not really fair. It is, in fact, a horrible 
        rite of passage that once experienced will be dreaded for years to come. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>There are many ways to avoid the humiliation. One can try, at least on 
        nights where special dress is not required, to wear clothes that will 
        not scream &quot;I am walking home after spending last night in some unknown 
        person's bed!&quot; quite so loudly. There is the option of going directly 
        to the room of a friend who also lives in Moore Hall or Harpswell Apartments 
        to borrow clothing, soap, and a brush. And there are always friends or 
        roommates who may be called in an emergency to pick you up.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But, dear readers, there is a simple way to avoid the walk of shame! 
        The host may offer to drive the guest home! It is the mark of a true gentleman 
        or lady to perform this small but not trivial act of kindness. Everyone 
        who does should be well thanked and rewarded. If all students with a car 
        (or keys to a friend's) who had someone sleep over were so decent as to 
        extend this courtesy, the world truly would be a better place. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And so, the next time you see some poor, unfortunate soul trudging home 
        early in the morning from last night's follies, do not shake your head 
        in disgust. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Rather pity them and, as you silently curse whoever did not offer them 
        a ride home, pick them up in your own car, if you are driving one at the 
        time. At the very least, allow them to retain some semblance of dignity 
        by not pointing and staring. I promise you, the Walk does not need to 
        be any more Shameful than it already is. There is no way to ensure that 
        it won't happen to you one day; when it does, then and only then will 
        you understand.</p>
