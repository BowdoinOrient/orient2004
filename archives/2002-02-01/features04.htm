        ALUMNUS WRITER </font></p>
      <p align="left">I remember the moment exactly. In summer of '65, standing 
        at an intersection on Market Street in downtown San Francisco, waiting 
        for the lights to change, I happened to glance at a newspaper, in a coin-operated 
        dispenser, with the headline, U.S. TO BOMB HANOI. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I couldn't believe it. America was getting deeper and deeper 
        into what many Americans themselves thought was not only an unjustified 
        war, but a deeply immoral one. For me, it was the straw that broke the 
        camel's back. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the home front, race riots were engulfing American cities. 
        In Los Angeles, a huge cloud of black smoke hung over Watts, an outlying 
        district with a largely black population. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Burn, baby, burn,&quot; black youths on the rampage, 
        not for the first, nor the last, time, were chanting. What was happening 
        to America? Was this still the same country with which I had fallen in 
        love after driving across it, &quot;from sea to shining sea,&quot; at 
        the end of my first year at Bowdoin?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then, too I was beginning to have personal problems. My 
        relationship with Ron was deteriorating. He deceived me, and I him.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ron worked at the Post Office, and I not at all. So, I'd 
        pick people up and take them back to the room we shared on the top floor 
        of a house on Larkin Street. The landlady I remember had a colored photograph 
        of FDR hanging on the wall; just like my Mrs. Lincoln at Brunswick, my 
        landlady at 101 Union Street, where I'd shared rooms with fellow TD's, 
        Ed Podvoll and Zal Colodny&#133;those were the days. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I'd come a long way, but wasn't sure if I hadn't actually 
        lost my way. Was I really gay? Did I really want to spend the rest of 
        my life with Ron or in America? What did I want to do with it anyway? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Watts burnt and Hanoi was bombed, a decision ripened 
        within me. <br>
        I would go back to Europe for good, back to college even. To study what? 
        Film-making.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My twin brother, a librarian in Berlin, whom I had last 
        seen while in the Army, had, in the meantime, married. Mathew's wife happened 
        to be the librarian at the newly founded Film Institute in Berlin, sponsored 
        by the West German government. I should start by learning to make 16-mm 
        films Dora advised.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But would Nellie, in her late eighties and visibly ailing, 
        agree to finance yet another course of studies for her errant 'German 
        boy'? Incredibly enough, I managed to persuade her. Maybe because she 
        sensed, though she didn't know about us, that it would be good for me 
        to get away from Ron for a while. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'll tell you what, Lou,&quot; she said, having discussed 
        with her attorney how best to help me, &quot;I'll put a certain amount 
        in an account for you, on the condition that you use it to go back to 
        school.&quot; Having given her my word, I would do so. Nellie decided 
        to let me have five thousand dollars, the equivalent, then, of twenty 
        thousand marks. I was over the moon, as the English say. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ron, too, thought it was a good idea I should go to Berlin. 
        He himself, hoping to get back into the theatre, was thinking of going 
        back to New York, he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In January of '66, we celebrated my 30th birthday, in style, 
        at the Mark Hopkins. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then, disaster struck. Nellie had a massive stroke. I rushed 
        down to Carmel. Luckily, being a tough old bird, she hadn't suffered irreparable 
        damage. Nevertheless, I didn't feel I could leave now, or at least not 
        until she'd fully recovered. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She needed a period of convalescence of at least three months, 
        the doctor told me. So, with her approval, I booked passage by boat from 
        New York to Rotterdam in May. In the meantime, she would try and find 
        someone else to look after her. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Due to her brush with death, though never a religious person, 
        Nellie suddenly became interested in the B'hais, a 19th-century off-shoot 
        of Islam stressing the unity of all religions, with millions of followers 
        round the world and a temple in Chicago. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even in Carmel there was a B'hai community. And it was its 
        local guru who offered to look after Nellie, probably in hopes of her 
        leaving the B'hais some money. A bearded fellow in his thirties, with 
        an extraordinarily high voice, Norbert, after I left, moved into the self-contained 
        little apartment next to the garage of Nellie's western-style bungalow 
        in which I used to stay. She'd be in goods hands, Nellie beamed; sitting 
        on her glass-enclosed patio and enjoying the view of Carmel Bay in the 
        background. Not all her friends were convinced though. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To tell the truth, I didn't expect to see her again or Ronnie, 
        determined as I was to turn over a new leaf. I wanted to get away not 
        only from America, but the gay scene. Good luck, Ron said, with an ironic 
        grin. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After flying to New York, I once again boarded a boat of 
        the Holland-America Line; larger and more luxurious than the one that 
        had carried me to the New World for the first time in 1954. As an unattached 
        male, I was put in a cabin and at a table with two others, one a retired 
        railway man from Sacramento, the other a Reverend from Cleveland, who 
        for some reason (not hard to figure out) took a great shine to me. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But, I'd put all that behind me. Or so I thought, until 
        a chance encounter in Berlin I'll tell you about next week.<br>
