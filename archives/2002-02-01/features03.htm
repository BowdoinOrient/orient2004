      <p align="left">In 1863, Senator William Pitt Fessenden wrote to one of 
        his sons, about to go to the front, &quot;You may take this knowledge 
        with you, my dear boy-that your father feels that you deserve his love, 
        and that if you fall in the discharge of your duty, if he shall be able 
        to bear your loss it will be because you have been to him a comfort and 
        a pleasure from the hour of your birth. I trust, however, that God will 
        preserve you to cheer my remaining years and to close my eyes. I have 
        only to repeat-take all the care of yourself, for my sake, that you can 
        take consistently with your duty and your honor.&quot;<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">There was, however, more to this letter than a plea for 
        safety. Fessenden was nearing the end of his life, having graduated from 
        Bowdoin in 1823-compared to his youngest son who had graduated in the 
        class of 1861-and also he had very few people left in the world whom he 
        truly loved. His wife was long in her grave and a year earlier in the 
        Second Bull Run Campaign of 1862, his son Sam had been killed in the line 
        of duty.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sam Fessenden was a high-spirited youth who, before he was 
        even walking the grounds of Bowdoin, had gone out west to fight for freedom 
        in &quot;Bleeding Kansas.&quot; When the Civil War began, the youth had 
        just graduated from Bowdoin and had volunteered along with another one 
        of his classmates, Thomas Worchester Hyde of Bath. Hyde became a major 
        in the Seventh Maine Volunteers while Sam Fessenden ended up as a lieutenant 
        in the Army of Virginia, commanded by General John Pope.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The military situation in the middle of 1862 in the eastern 
        theater was not good. General George McClellan's Union army was bottled 
        up on the York-James Peninsula. Thomas Hyde, camping with that army, wrote 
        that the site was &quot;the hottest place we had yet discovered, and there 
        was a plague of flies&#133;The heat, the monotony, and our ill success, 
        added to the malaria of the Chickahominy, produced a frightful amount 
        of sickness.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Lincoln Administration attempted to rectify the situation 
        by sending the newly created Army of Virginia south. It was hoped that 
        Pope's army would destroy the rebel army-commanded by Robert E. Lee-and 
        finish the war in the east. One by one the regiments of McClellan's army 
        were transferred to Pope's. Thomas Hyde was certainly unhappy about this 
        turn of events, wrote, &quot;Our time came to embark for Alexandria to 
        join General Pope's army, supposed to be fighting near Washington, and 
        while we were eager to do our duty, it was an unpleasing prospect to be 
        placed under command of a general who had insulted the Army of the Potomac 
        in his orders, and whom we already had sized up for a braggart.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The fight was near Washington instead of Richmond was because 
        Robert E. Lee did not like to be the one doing the guesswork. He had sent 
        a portion of his army to raid Pope's supplies and soon followed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The climax of the campaign did not come until the 29th of 
        August when Pope's troops concentrated around the old Bull Run battlefield. 
        Thomas Hyde was in the middle of a forced march to get to the field, while 
        Sam Fessenden was serving on the staff of a general already at the front.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The task of piecing together the events of Sam Fessenden's 
        last few days went to his grieving father, William, who wrote of his son's 
        final adventures to a friend. On the battlefield of Bull Run as Pope hammered 
        away at Jackson's position behind an unfinished railroad cut, Sam Fessenden 
        was &quot;cheerful&quot; and &quot;smiling,&quot; only once expressing 
        any fear, and that was for the enemy's escape. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unbeknownst to young Fessenden, the rebels were not escaping. 
        They were in fact, coming to him-Lee was arriving with the rest of his 
        army. August 30 saw the advance of Longstreet's wing of the Army of Northern 
        Virginia. Trapping Pope in a classic V-shaped jaw, Lee swung the two halves 
        of his army together, causing the collapse of Federal resistance. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sam Fessenden was placing a regiment in a field when the 
        fateful bullet found him. His father wrote that his clock had stopped 
        at around ten to five and, thus, assumed that this was when he was struck. 
        Friendly hands conducted the senator's son to Union-held Centreville. 
        Upon learning that his wound was mortal, the youngster said simply, &quot;Very 
        well. It is all right.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thomas Hyde was on the battlefield by that time. His regiment 
        was thrown out in front as skirmishers to prevent the rebels from cutting 
        off Pope's retreat. Hyde remembered that &quot;my gloomy forebodings did 
        not tell me that in the house so near he [Sam Fessenden] lay mortally 
        wounded, brave and resigned to the last.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few days after his wounding, Sam Fessenden's time came. 
        It was a Monday morning when the surgeon came and offered him some brandy. 
        A small amount of liquid was pressed to the boy's lips but he quickly 
        pushed the offering away and said his last words, &quot;I won't, I won't.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">William Pitt Fessenden, who had done so much to fund the 
        war effort, was at home in Maine at the time. His son's body was sent 
        north to Portland and was laid to rest.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To his friend, after recounting his son's final days, William 
        Pitt Fessenden wrote, &quot;For the loss of a beloved child, there is 
        no such thing as consolation. There is however a melancholy satisfaction 
        in reflecting that he died in a just and holy cause to which he devoted 
        himself from a sense of duty to God and his country.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Fessendens, like thousands of other families nationwide, 
        had come to know the price of war. But the price had not yet been paid 
        in full.<br>
