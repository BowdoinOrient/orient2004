        <font size="2">TODD BUELL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>The Platonic view of philosophy emphasizes the use of reason and the 
        quelling of the passions. This has become the template upon which the 
        classical liberal model of governance was built. As the Enron scandal 
        develops, it becomes essential that we remember the importance of reason 
        before we deconstruct the sacred principles of our country in our intoxicated 
        state of indignation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Political opponents of the President, most notably Representative Henry 
        Waxman (D-Cal.), are looking to tie the Bush administration to Enron's 
        collapse. One criticism centers on the administration's refusal to intervene 
        when Enron executives called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and alerted 
        him of the company's potential failure. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The other stems from the supposed influence that Enron procured in shaping 
        President Bush's energy policy. Waxman and other critics are advancing 
        two arguments in response. The first involves the Shays-Meehan campaign 
        finance bill. This is the House version of McCain-Feingold, which the 
        Senate passed last spring. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The second argument involves the records of meetings that Vice President 
        Dick Cheney had with Enron executives during the development of the energy 
        policy. In both instances, critics are twisting a business scandal into 
        a political scandal and are supporting overzealous legislation that could 
        have unnecessary consequences. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This is not to suggest that legislation should not arise from Enron's 
        collapse. There is almost universal agreement that questions need to be 
        asked regarding the company's policy with its employees' 401(k) plans. 
        We do need to pursue the recent discovery of shredded documents at Arthur 
        Andersen and certainly should examine the rules that allow Andersen to 
        serve as both Enron's accountant and consultant. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As opinion columnist George Will said recently, &quot;A mature capitalist 
        economy is a government project&#133;a complex creation of laws and mores 
        that guarantee&#133;reliable information.&quot; In fact, it has been conservatives 
        who have most strongly advocated consequences against Enron and its executives 
        if there were illegalities in its corporate operation. But to suggest 
        that Bush is to blame and that laws need to be changed regarding corporate 
        America's relationship with Washington is preposterous. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For example, Shays-Meehan would ban the unregulated &quot;soft&quot; 
        money donated by political action committees (PACs) to political parties. 
        Clearly this bill has consequences that extend beyond corporate influence. 
        It would affect PACs of all political affiliations, not only those connected 
        to business interests. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This legislation would hamstring the environmental lobby, labor lobby, 
        and groups that advocate for the homeless. By banning soft money donations, 
        Shays-Meehan essentially denies groups of people that may not possess 
        large sums of money individually the ability to coalesce behind particular 
        causes and endorse the party of their choice. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As Will wrote last March, campaign finance reform seeks to deny those 
        who are affected by government the right to affect government. This law 
        is at best constitutionally tenuous and is a dangerous affront to free 
        speech. If nothing else, Enron's failure to garner influence shows that 
        this &quot;anti-influence&quot; bill serves no purpose but to keep lawmakers 
        sheltered from the people. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some argue however, that Cheney's meeting with Enron executives last 
        year proves that some nefarious corporate influence had infected the White 
        House. Thus the General Accounting Office has filed suit to force the 
        release of records from these meetings. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Cheney is fighting this suit vigorously under the defense of Executive 
        Privilege. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleisher explained at a press 
        conference last week that Bush adamantly believes that Americans should 
        feel comfortable speaking to the President without fear of the contents 
        of the conversation being disseminated. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This may sound like an ostensible legalistic defense meant to obfuscate 
        quid pro quo. However, the executive branch is treating this case correctly. 
        The President rightfully expects candor from those upon whom he relies 
        for information to shape national policy. Therefore, those in the President's 
        administration have an expectation of inviolable confidence when speaking 
        to him. They want the ability to criticize their company, those in their 
        industry, maybe even lawmakers-without fear of reprisal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If the president wishes to waive executive privilege, that is his prerogative. 
        However, a coerced decision to the same effect could severely compromise 
        the reliability of the information that the President garners from private 
        consultations. Since these discussions often help shape policy, honesty 
        is imperative, and thus confidentiality is paramount.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When Socrates dies at the end of his &quot;Apology,&quot; executed for 
        impiety and corrupting the youth, we see the tragic consequences of passion 
        subjugating reason. Though there is much indignation over the Enron collapse, 
        let us not confound needed business reforms with unneeded desecrations 
        of the First Amendment guised under the veil of political reform.</p>
