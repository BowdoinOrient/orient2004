      <p align="left"><font size="5">Rocking out to internet radio</font><br>
        <font size="2">DANIEL JEFFERSON MILLER</font><br>
      </p>
      <p>I have just discovered that the MP3 player on my laptop can dial into 
        several dozen internet radio stations. Divided into musical genres, there 
        are stations from all over the world: the Russian pop station, the French 
        classic rock station, and a country station based out of the small town 
        of Sullivan, Missouri. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A Missouri native myself, I wouldn't expect more than a handful of Bowdoin 
        students to recognize how out of place 100.9 KTUI seems to be. What an 
        age we live in! From the comfort of my own room in Brunswick, Maine, I 
        can rock out to the country sound stylings of a rural Missouri station. 
        I can listen to the sensible midwestern disc jockey banter that amuses 
        few and irritates many.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe I don't want to listen to KTUI from more than 1,000 miles away. 
        Maybe radio stations in Sullivan, Missouri radio should stay within the 
        weak range of their broadcast signals. As globalization seeps into every 
        last crack and seam of society, regionalism is dying at an alarming rate. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>At first, I'll admit, the novelty of these stations seemed cool. I found 
        one station that drew me in with back to back to back hits by The Doors. 
        Two of these were live versions of &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;The Unknown 
        Soldier&quot;-lengthy songs, roughly ten minutes apiece, and not songs 
        one might normally hear on a radio station. The Doors triple-shot was 
        followed by a couple of somewhat obscure Grateful Dead songs, then Pink 
        Floyd, and on down the expected route.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As I sat in my room, following up on emails and reading over the latest 
        issue of <i>The New Yorker</i>, I found myself rocking out. For those 
        of you who aren't familiar with &quot;rocking out,&quot; let me explain. 
        Rocking out can best be described as hanging out and listening to tunes 
        that remind you of good times in your life (&quot;Oh, this song is so 
        ninth grade!&quot;).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Rocking out is epitomized by that feeling of excitement you get when 
        you've just heard a great song on the radio and another one of your favorites 
        comes on next. Even though you're completely comfortable with the present 
        volume level, you inexplicably crank it up another notch. Rocking out 
        to certain songs, such as Boston's &quot;More than a Feeling&quot; or 
        Def Leppard's &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me,&quot; is highly unavoidable, 
        even though your musical consciousness tells you these titles are somewhat 
        exhausted. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I was indeed rocking out when the Guess Who's &quot;American Woman&quot; 
        came on. Having heard the Lenny Kravitz version several dozen times a 
        day for the last few years, I was glad to rock out to the opening guitar 
        riffs of the original, but I digress&#133;.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I've made it apparent that I was impressed by the musical selections. 
        As Jethro Tull's Bungle in the Jungle came on, I adjusted the volume without 
        thought, thus placing myself at further risk of irreversible inner-ear 
        damage. Several rock anthems later I realized that I had been rocking 
        out for nearly an hour. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It was then that I became fully aware of what I was listening to. Every 
        so often some computer generated voice came on with a tone that seems 
        to suggest, &quot;If you even think about turning off your radio I'll 
        kick your ass, because you have pledged your soul to rocking out twenty-four 
        hours a day.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>This voice irritated me, but after a quick, tired, comedic soundbyte 
        from the Chris Farley classic Tommy Boy, it was back to the tunes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But where was the DJ? Where were the quips about Clinton's sex life, 
        or Bush's inability to masticate properly? (Sophomoric DJs nationwide 
        took great delight in discovering this word in the wake of Bush's pretzel 
        incident.) <br>
        This is not to say that I am a fan of the idiotic chitchat that plagues 
        nearly every commercial radio station. What bothered me was the amount 
        of effort, or lack thereof, that was going into these broadcasts. Technically, 
        if given the proper computer equipment, a fourteen-year-old boy could 
        effectively produce this stuff out of his parent's garage in Scranton, 
        Pennsylvania.<br>
      </p>
      <p>These stations, while they effectively allow you to rock, undermine our 
        attention spans. WBOR will begin regular broadcasting next Monday, and 
        not soon enough. After experimenting with the character-less and empty 
        broadcasts of internet radio, I'm ready to listen to a station where there 
        is some effort dedicated to each show. I'm tired of listening to never-ending 
        playlists. Yes, I've enjoyed rocking out; I've made that abundantly clear. 
        But if we all subscribe to faceless entertainment, are we not at risk 
        of becoming faceless ourselves?</p>
