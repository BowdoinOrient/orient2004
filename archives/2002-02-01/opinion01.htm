      <p align="left">Is O'Neill out of his mind?<br>
        Craig Giammona, Columnist</p>
      <p>I became physically ill and vomited on two separate occasions over Winter 
        Break. The first time involved a bottle of Blue Moon Amigos tequila, a 
        Catholic priest, three gymnasts, and an impassioned discussion of social 
        democracy in Scandinavia. The second involved the secretary of the United 
        States Treasury Department, Paul O'Neill. I will focus on the latter occasion 
        primarily because it has some political relevance, but also because I 
        have not yet been able to discuss the former.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I was sitting in a kosher pizzeria in downtown Englewood, New Jersey, 
        enjoying a falafel and reading The New York Post when I came across an 
        article about the Enron debacle. Contained in this article was Paul O'Neill 
        waxing poetic on the subject of Enron and what general truths about capitalism 
        could be taken away from its savage demise. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Companies come and go...&quot; the quotation read, &quot;...it's 
        the genius of capitalism.&quot; I read it over a few times, the only thing 
        preventing an immediate expulsion of the whole of my stomach contents 
        being the fact that I had read the quote in <i>The New York Post</i>. 
        It had to be some kind of slant, or spin, or twist, or wrong, or out of 
        context. Regardless, the secretary of the United States Treasury surely 
        had not referred to the collapse of Enron, in which hundreds of employees 
        lost their jobs and retirement funds largely because of questionable accounting 
        practices and false claims made by executives, as the &quot;genius of 
        capitalism.&quot; I felt ill, paid for my lunch and headed back to the 
        Accounting Department at Town Motors Car Corporation to start my afternoon 
        work.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The car ride back to the office was marked by deep contemplation, mild 
        twinges of nausea, and the growing suspicion that the Post had reported 
        the quote correctly. This suspicion was quickly confirmed when I returned 
        to the office and grabbed a copy of <i>The New York Times</i> from the 
        afternoon receptionist. There it was, the same quote right in the <i>Times</i>; 
        it had to be true. I became dizzy and stumbled for a few steps before 
        I vomited violently and passed out.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When I came to a few moments later a janitor was cleaning up the vomit, 
        the receptionist was at her desk holding a picture of Jesus tightly to 
        her chest and sobbing softly, and nervous mothers were shielding the eyes 
        of their children and ushering them quickly away from the horrible scene.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I made my way upstairs and began putting the 2001 invoices in numerical 
        order. I assured my fellow workers that I was &quot; all right,&quot; 
        but I was deceiving them. I felt cold and had great difficulty sitting 
        still, let alone concentrating enough to do important accounting work. 
        My mind was jumping quickly from thought to thought. I felt as if people 
        were watching me. I was continually confronted with the suppressed memory 
        of an ex-girlfriend who ended our five-week 1996 relationship with the 
        line, &quot;I just can't have a relationship with a guy with a good personality.&quot; 
        I remembered wondering what was worse: if she had really meant what she 
        said, or if she wanted to make up a diplomatic break line that would end 
        our relationship in as pleasant a manner as possible and that was what 
        she came up with. I starting shaking in my office chair, and screaming 
        Spanish profanities. I was sent home early.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A few weeks removed from the incident I have been able to contemplate 
        the events with a clear head and come to some fairly rational conclusions. 
        Finally, I have come to understand why the memory of my former girlfriend 
        was so prominent in my thinking that day. In the case of Paul O'Neill 
        and his callous comments, I once again find myself asking, &quot;Which 
        is worse?&quot; <br>
        So which is worse: Paul O'Neill actually thinking that the fall of Enron 
        is somehow an indicator of capitalism's genius, or-assuming that he does 
        feel this way and was stupid and unsympathetic enough to actually express 
        these views to the public-that there wasn't a great deal of public outrage 
        and condemnation? <br>
      </p>
      <p>I have no doubt that Paul O'Neill does, in no uncertain terms, believe 
        what he said, which to me is an indication that our American belief in 
        the inherent good and infallibility of capitalism has gotten a little 
        out of hand. I am not a socialist. I believe that capitalism is an effective 
        and natural way to organize citizens and business. I believe that competition 
        and free markets lead to better products for consumers and faster service. 
        However, the American government's deep-seated belief in free markets 
        has progressed to dogma. <br>
        We are now faced with a binding and blinding belief that markets, left 
        to their own devices, will inherently produce positive outcomes. In a 
        zero-sum free market there are always winners and losers, and the fact 
        is, positive results are usually apparent if you approach from the perspective 
        of those who have benefited. We have allowed business and big money to 
        pervade all aspects of our society, all the while prescribing to the belief 
        that free markets are inherently good and fair because they allow for 
        &quot;fair&quot; competition to determine winners and losers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We deregulated media, and the result is information becoming a commodity 
        that is bought and sold. Big corporations and the money they spend on 
        advertising are able to control television and newspaper content-a direct 
        result of the marketization of media. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Politics have also succumbed to the pressure and influence of big money, 
        and have become just another marketplace where a product-policy, in this 
        case-can be purchased by consumers willing and able to pay the highest 
        price. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A strict reliance on the concept of free markets has led us to our current 
        situation, and democracy cannot function properly if this continues. Arrogant 
        and dogmatic comments such as those made by Paul O'Neill should not be 
        taken lightly, and the political culture that allows for such comments 
        to be made should be questioned-as should the theories of a drunk priest 
        in the company of three gymnasts.</p>
