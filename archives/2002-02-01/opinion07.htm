        <font size="2">SARAH RAMEY<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>If I had to pick a favorite word, I'm pretty sure it would be 'Booyah.' 
        Being a)female and b)white as white comes, I find that it has absolutely 
        no place in any sentence I could ever conceive of saying, and therefore 
        has all the more reason to be used on a regular basis. I think a little 
        Booyah around campus might just give us the edge we're looking for.</p>
      <p>STUDENT: Hi Elaine&#133;I'm really sorry, but I forgot my card.<br>
        ELAINE: Booyah! Write down your ID number on this sheet of paper. Next.<br>
        --or--<br>
        PROFESSOR: Can anyone take us to a passage that spoke to them? Yes, go 
        ahead Cassie.<br>
        CASSIE (a timid student): Um, I thought page 74, second paragraph down 
        that talks about music was good&#133;because I'm a musician. It resonated 
        with me.<br>
        PROFESSOR: Very nice, Cassie. <br>
        CASSIE (Standing and pointing at said professor): Booyah!</p>
      <p>Because the thing is, what is Booyah? I mean, really. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But rather than simply letting that oft-posed query &quot;what is Booyah?&quot; 
        stand as rhetorical, well, I'll tell you what I did instead. I went to 
        the Internet, the place where any and everything has been documented in 
        some ridiculous fashion by some ridiculous person with ridiculous passions 
        for such compelling topics as Booyah.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Let me preface this by saying that it is not easy to make a web page. 
        No, it is not as much &quot;simple&quot; or &quot;straightforward&quot; 
        but rather more along the lines of Supremely Impossible and Utterly Hopeless. 
        Long ago in some moment of total idiocy and self delusion I attempted 
        to learn. Not only did it confirm my suspicions of my own gaping void 
        in the left-most regions of my brain, but it brought to my attention that 
        making a web page requires a staggering amount of dedication and patience. 
        So what I'm saying is, someone had to sit down at their computer for a 
        significant amount of time, typety type type, to create an entire page 
        about&#133;.Booyah.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Anyways, back to my research. In my extensive web search, the one result 
        that caught my eye was a site entitled &quot;What in the world is Booyah?&quot; 
        Now, I would have been perfectly satisfied with a definition of the word 
        in terms of its usage in common slang&#133;however, what I got nearly 
        made me wet myself right then and there.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So now that you're on the edge of your seat, wondering what in the world 
        Booyah is, here is what www.doorbell.net had to say about it, and I quote:</p>
      <p>&quot;Booyah (rhymes with doo-dah) is a chicken soup sometimes known 
        as Belgian penicillin. Belgian festivities where it is served in copious 
        amounts have been the subject of picketing by Chickens for a Sustainable 
        Future.&quot;<br>
        --author unknown (my personal favorite part of this whole mess)</p>
      <p>If I had been forced at knifepoint to come up with a definition for 'Booyah' 
        in a dangerous game of Balderdash, I am fairly certain that in the realm 
        of possibile things I could have come up with, this would have ranked 
        in at about dead last.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Now, let us note: somewhere out there exists an organization entitled 
        Chickens for a Sustainable Future. An organization that has members. Members 
        who are living, breathing human beings, who actively chose to be members 
        of CFASF. And there is a distinct possibility that they may have T-shirts&#133;and 
        in my mind, these shirts feature robust, smiling chickens raising the 
        roof. Why? I think why not is the more interesting question. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But that's beside the point. There is a soup, named Booyah, that on occasion 
        gets served in copious amounts &#133;and this Booyah soup-serving has 
        prompted enough fury in the Chickens for a Sustainable Future community 
        for them to actually stage a protest. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I want you to imagine what exactly this implies: somebody probably had 
        to start a phone chain to rally the troops and alert them to the latest 
        Booyoutrage. Then they had to sit in their garages, making picket signs, 
        then carpool to whatever Belgian festivity was acting up, and spend the 
        better part of their day demonstrating to crowds of angry Booyah consumers. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>AND, not to dwell on the subject, but what does Chickens for a Sustainable 
        Future even mean? Somehow the preservation of the chicken is how we are 
        intended to sustain our precarious future? Poo poo to the o-zone layer. 
        World hunger doesn't concern us. Why strive for peace on earth when there 
        are chickens to be saved from the murderous hands of the Booyah makers! 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Luckily, amidst all of this total ridiculosity they did have the presence 
        of mind to dispel a common error surrounding this sensitive subject: the 
        mispronunciation of the word Booyah. Contrary to what you might think, 
        it does not rhyme with &quot;hippopotamus&quot; or &quot;badger,&quot; 
        but rather with &quot;doo-dah.&quot; Exactly how it looks. Please take 
        note. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sigh. This, my opening article for the spring season, has gone far beyond 
        where I had originally intended. I was going to write something about 
        how strange it is to be back, or the little things that I had missed, 
        or an elaborate story for why Julianna is no longer the premise for this 
        article&#133;but, somehow, Booyah got the better of me, and, well, here 
        we are. <br>
      </p>
      <p>See you in two weeks with another installment of total non-sequitur.<br>
