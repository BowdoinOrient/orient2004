        <font size="2">GENEVIEVE CREEDON<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>I had begun writing a response to the Martin Luther King Jr. celebration 
        last week when someone came into the room; then the phone rang, and I 
        never got to finish, which, in the end, may have been for the best. Maybe 
        some of you will think that it's a bit late to still be reflecting on 
        an event that took place almost two weeks ago, but the reflections are 
        always relevant, and the message should be universal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I was once asked to define character, and I realize now that it can mean 
        any number of things. Certainly each person on this campus would come 
        up with a different definition. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, whatever your own definition may be, I don't think there are 
        many people in this world who would disagree that Martin Luther King Jr. 
        was a man of character. In a sense, it is that character that we celebrate 
        every year. King's many accomplishments are almost secondary. His character 
        makes him the American hero he rightly deserves to be. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It seemed wrong to me, however, that instead of celebrating that character, 
        Robert Johnson speculated in his lecture about what King would have done 
        or thought, had he been living today. I don't think the matter has anything 
        to do with political leanings. I don't disagree necessarily with what 
        Johnson said, but it didn't seem to me to be an appropriate honor to a 
        man who certainly deserves proper commemoration. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As I listened to Johnson speak last week, I realized that we are stuck 
        in a time that has no Martin Luther Kings. Instead, we look back on this 
        &quot;heroic age&quot; of the past, stirring a deep nostalgia that is 
        almost as frustrating as it is moving. We talk about what King would have 
        done. We compare our current politicians to the righteous founding fathers. 
        We pose an oft-harsh (if deserved) critique of the people who lead us, 
        but we remain merely content to throw the words around and do nothing. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Our parents and grandparents fought wars so that we wouldn't have to 
        do the same, and in a sense, they succeeded. Even though we have a war 
        going on thousands of miles away, it hasn't swept the country the way 
        wars have in the past. We've got men fighting in that distant &quot;over 
        there,&quot; but back here, we can go about pretending that everything 
        is just fine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Our greatest problem is, of course, that we start believing in the illusion 
        that everything is &quot;just fine.&quot; I think part of Johnson's motivation 
        was to make us realize that complacency is not a viable option, even if 
        we've relied on it thus far. We have been lucky and sheltered members 
        of the information age, and we've been given so much in the interest of 
        our great future. <br>
      </p>
      <p>And that future is vaster and greater now than anyone could have anticipated. 
        It may be that we are fighting a war that is unlike any other war in history. 
        It may be that we didn't have the tools to fight a &quot;new&quot; war, 
        so we're fighting the old one. But all it truly means is that our generation 
        will be required to provide answers to all the questions we've been asking.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Whether or not we will have those answers is very much up for grabs. 
        We certainly have been prepared to make valiant attempts at finding them, 
        but there is a lot we have to let go of in order to do so. Blind idealism 
        may be a strong characteristic of our generation, and we have to sacrifice 
        it eventually. Every generation does.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In spite of all the counts that have been placed against us, I still 
        want to believe that we won't remain satisfied with the complacently amorphous 
        character we've cultivated thus far. Maybe that belief is my own little 
        piece of idealism, but more often than not, it's a manifestation of hope. 
        It is a strong but fragile hope that we will define our character and 
        become it, because it is and will be our destiny.<br>
