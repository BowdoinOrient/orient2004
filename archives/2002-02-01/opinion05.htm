      <p> In case you missed it, President Bush gave his annual State of the Union 
        address to the assembled houses of Congress on Tuesday night. This constitutionally-mandated 
        address provides the President with a chance to communicate his agenda 
        for the coming year to both the legislature and the electorate. They have 
        assumed an increasing importance in the television age, especially in 
        the last few decades, utilized for important announcements and priority 
        shifts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The only reason I bring this is up is that I am assuming that you did 
        not watch it. I know a fair number of you did, but definitely not the 
        majority. From my amazingly scientific polling method (namely, the famous 
        eavesdropping/ask-your-friends method), most were not even aware that 
        it was going on. While I won't say that I'm not disappointed by this, 
        you are not alone. The majority of Americans did not watch the State of 
        the Union; most were probably agitated that their usual fair of sitcoms, 
        sports, and sentimentality had been interrupted. This has all been part 
        of a general decline in public interest in public affairs over the past 
        several decades. It seems that people really don't care what happens to 
        them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Well us smart kids at Bowdoin are supposed to be better than that, right? 
        Because we have had the privilege of good genes and education, we're going 
        to be involved and aware of the world around us. If not that, we should 
        at least be as involved as other campuses of similar caliber. <br>
        Unfortunately, we are not. We live in the Bowdoin Bubble-our insular little 
        community in an isolated corner of New England where our interests are 
        definitely not global in scope. I know this is a rather harsh generalization 
        and that there are many exceptions to the rule. However, an unfortunate 
        feature about stereotypes is that they often contain an element of truth. 
        Bowdoin is extremely inwardly focused and that is reflected in the attitudes 
        of the student body.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I know others have said it before and, to a degree, this is beating a 
        dead horse. But it's a gong that needs to be banged. I was hopeful that 
        the catastrophes of this past fall would reawaken a more global focus 
        in the Bowdoin student body's perspective. For a time, this was the case. 
        I think CNN might have outdone ESPN and all the major broadcast networks 
        combined. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, this interest was fleeting. Now that the new semester 
        has begun, the same old attitudes regarding the outside world have returned, 
        and we have retreated back into the Bowdoin Bubble. Granted, things are 
        better now than they were when I arrived here four years ago, but not 
        by much. </p>
      <p>Bowdoin still has a long way to go in terms of awareness of and involvement 
        in public and international affairs. We should all be interested in public 
        events and issues, since the government of our land directly affects the 
        daily lives of each and everyone of us. The events of September 11 made 
        that all the more poignant. So let us endeavor to break out of the Bowdoin 
        Bubble. If one thing is certain, the ostrich is not any safer when it 
        sticks its head in the sand, and neither are we.</p>
