        <font size="2">ANDREW MINESS<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">Winning. If you know sports, you recognize that winning 
        must be the mindset that an individual and team have going into the game. 
        Without such a mindset, what would be the point of playing the game? There 
        wouldn't be any, because believing in yourself and your teammates is more 
        than half the battle. The game is not played on paper, anything can happen 
        on any given day. If the favorite always won and the underdog always lost, 
        we as sports fans would not need to watch the games. There would be no 
        drama, no hope for a comeback, no surprises. The outcome would be decided 
        before the game began. However, when it comes to sports, the favorite 
        going into the game does not always walk away the winner. In fact, the 
        belief that an underdog can beat the favorite provides sports fans with 
        the incentive to watch the game, because something incredible can happen.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This adage of believing in the underdog does not falter 
        this week. Amidst the hoopla of Super Bowl XXXVI, the Rams have been called 
        the &quot;greatest show on earth,&quot; while the Patriots have been deemed 
        the bridesmaids. Many sports reporters have already discounted the Patriots; 
        football expert John Clayton even went as far to say that, &quot;the Patriots 
        are unfortunate afterthoughts,&quot; claiming that they should be glad 
        to have come this far. </p>
      <p align="left">Ugggghhh!!!! The Patriots have not come this far to roll 
        over; they are in New Orleans to win and become the next underdog to upset 
        the strong favorite. And by winning this Sunday, the Patriots will provide 
        sports fans with more hope in the future that the game is not decided 
        until the last whistle sounds. The Patriots do not have to look far for 
        inspiration this week, they merely have to remember some of the greatest 
        moments in sports history; Buster Douglas knocking out Tyson, Joe Namath 
        leading the Jets to a Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl III, NC State knocking 
        off the University of Houston to win the 1984 NCAA Championship. These 
        are just several examples of David taking down Goliath, and thus the Patriots 
        just have to believe in themselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The greatest part about this Sunday's game rests in the 
        fact that the Patriots do control their own destiny. Although many analysts 
        have termed them a team of &quot;destiny,&quot; the players do not agree 
        with such a reference. Lawyer Milloy, a safety for the Patriots, stated 
        during an interview, &quot;Our team is not a team of destiny. We see playoff 
        commercials or whatever, and they have all the other teams on there. I 
        don't see one guy from our team on that commercial. I mean, they have 
        guys talking about playoff experience and the atmosphere, and the guys 
        have never been to the playoffs before. That's crazy to me.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Milloy's words make it apparent that the Patriots do not 
        see themselves as a team lucky to be where they are. With little expectations 
        coming into the season, coupled with one of the smallest payrolls in the 
        NFL and an injury to the franchise quarterback in week 2, many teams and 
        reporters marked off games against the Patriots as sure wins. Now, with 
        a Super Bowl in reach, I find myself asking why not? I mean, the Patriots 
        have come this far and beaten the odds so many times, week in and week 
        out avoiding defeat in games they were supposed to lose, why can't they 
        win on Sunday?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of course history does not favor the Patriots. As a 14 point 
        underdog, their task does seem daunting, and add that to the fact that 
        the Super Bowl has only been determined 10 times by 9 points or less. 
        But all that should not matter come kickoff on Sunday. The game will come 
        down to execution, and that is what continues to give the Patriots players 
        and sports fans hope. This hope that the underdog will win is why we watch 
        the games; it proves that spectacular things can happen. And in turn, 
        this sense of hope goes beyond the realm of sports. It gives us all the 
        belief that even we can do the unthinkable. </p>
