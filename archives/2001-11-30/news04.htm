      <p align="left">As Bowdoin looks for ways to cope with the expected national 
        economic depression, growing power costs are adding an increasingly troublesome 
        financial burden to Bowdoin's budget.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Over the past five years, Kilowatt per Hour (KWH) usage 
        has increased by 5.5 million units while the unit price has risen by almost 
        20%. This year alone, the price of each KWH has risen 19.16%, and it is 
        projected that the school will require 700,000 KWH more than it did last 
        year. That translates to $4,447 a day, or $1,000 more being spent on power 
        than last year. In all, the total energy cost is up 24.83%.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Assistant Director for Properties and Budget 
        Administration Rick Parkhurst, the increase in power usage is from both 
        building renovations and additions as well as a growing number of appliances 
        and computers used by students. &quot;There are more microwaves, more 
        computers, more refrigerators,&quot; he said. &quot;All those things add 
        up.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Considering how many computers there are on campus and in 
        dorm rooms, it is clear why computer usage is an especially large concern. 
        Parkhurst said that many students simply leave their computer systems 
        and appliances on all night long. &quot;At home, people pay their power 
        bills, so they're aware of how much energy they use. At Bowdoin, a lot 
        of people think their power is free, but it's not. It has to come from 
        somewhere.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In fact, the money comes from other areas of the College 
        budget and the more the school spends on energy, the less it can spend 
        elsewhere.<br>
        &quot;It's a problem that has an umbrella effect,&quot; said Keisha Payson, 
        the Coordinator for a Sustainable Bowdoin. &quot;What students need to 
        realize is that this affects everyone.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Understandably, Bowdoin is taking steps to reduce the amount 
        of money the school spends on power. There are plans to re-lamp certain 
        buildings and to install occupancy-sensor lights and more efficient fans. 
        The administration is also working with an outside consulting agency, 
        Combined Energy, to find additional ways to decrease power consumption. 
        These are only long-term solutions, however, as the benefits of these 
        expensive projects won't be seen for around 15 years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, as Payson explained, the most important thing is 
        raising awareness among the student body. Both Payson and Parkhurst agreed 
        that consumption would decrease significantly if students made more of 
        an effort to conserve power. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Simple things, such as turning your computer and stereo 
        off when they're not in use or shutting lights off when you're not in 
        a room can ease the school's growing financial burden. For example, a 
        computer system that is turned on 24 hours a day costs the school $17 
        a month. In comparison, it costs $3.40 to keep a computer running only 
        40 hours a week, which is more time than a typical student spends in front 
        of a monitor.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The effects of the school's increasing power usage stretch 
        well beyond finance. Although Maine does not yet face the energy shortages 
        that are plaguing the West Coast, energy prices rise for an entire area 
        as a whole when the demand increases. Also, a reduction in the school's 
        energy consumption would significantly reduce CO2 output.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the end, the extent to which Bowdoin is affected by power 
        costs remains largely within our hands. <br>
      </p>
