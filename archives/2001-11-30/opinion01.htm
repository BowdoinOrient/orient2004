      <p><font size="5">Where's the &quot;Western&quot; Requirement?</font><br>
        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font></p>
      <p>When I returned to campus on Sunday, I received an email from one of 
        my friends who goes to school in Iowa. She alerted me to a piece in the 
        Wall Street Journal that listed Bowdoin among a number of supposedly elite 
        schools that fail to require courses in history or western civilization. 
        Our placement on this list demonstrates a serious deficiency in our curriculum. 
        We require students to learn about distant parts of the world yet fail 
        to force these same students to grasp the basic foundations of their own 
        culture. </p>
      <p>I do not agree with the common rhetoric that all courses that do not 
        satisfy the &quot;non-eurocentric&quot; requirement are &quot;western.&quot; 
        It is quite possible that a Bowdoin student might never be exposed to 
        the extant themes among classical western writing. They might never encounter 
        the kaleidoscope of human nature found in the plays of Shakespeare, nor 
        digest the roots of our American polity in the words of Aristotle. </p>
      <p>It is shameful that as higher education has made itself more accessible 
        to people from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, we have 
        also decreased the emphasis on the classical writings and teachings, some 
        of which have served as the foundation of our society for over two millenia. 
        For example, as recently as seventy-five years ago, it was required that 
        one know both Greek and Latin for one to be admitted to Bowdoin and most 
        other elite colleges. However, in an effort to attract more students from 
        beyond private preparatory institutions, we along with other schools dropped 
        this requirement. This erosion of any core curriculum continued until 
        at one point in the 1970s Bowdoin lacked any distribution requirements. 
        As Stan Druckenmiller indicated in his Common Hour talk last October, 
        many alumni now recognize that the school was wrong by not insisting that 
        students take more courses outside of their major field. </p>
      <p>These alumni should not think that our current distribution requirements 
        are adequate. Especially in this time where the world's freedoms are being 
        so gravely threatened, it is essential that we understand the history 
        and cultures that influence our own free and liberal society. I recall 
        Thomas Jefferson who opined that our citizens should learn the history 
        and culture of only four societies: Greece, Rome, Great Britain, and the 
        United States; these being societies that experimented with liberty. Jefferson 
        rightly reasoned that by understanding the ways in which republics similar 
        to ours developed and then fell into decadence we could best preserve 
        our nascent republic. Of course today's world is more global and more 
        diverse than the world in which Jefferson lived, so I do not mean to suggest 
        that we eliminate the non-eurocentric requirement here at Bowdoin. I only 
        am recommending that it be matched with a requirement in some form of 
        traditional western thinking: Plato, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Homer, Goethe, 
        Schiller, etc. Whether we like it or not, these &quot;dead white men&quot; 
        are irreplaceable figures in our social, political, and cultural development 
        and we tragically deprive ourselves of valuable lessons by not grappling 
        with the relevant messages that their works impart on us.</p>
      <p>Such relevance is encapsulated in the Fall 2001 edition of &quot;The 
        Intercollegiate Studies Review&quot; where Prof. Louise Cowan quotes one 
        of her late colleagues Prof. Cedric Whitman. He articulates that &quot;the 
        notion of the hero is the center of one of the most powerful clusters 
        of ideas that ancient culture has bequeathed to Western literature and 
        art.&quot; Dr. Cowan intimates further that it was indeed the Greek ideal 
        of the selfless hero fighting for his city embodied in Achilles that our 
        framers envisioned to be the country's line of defense against threats 
        to liberty like that which we see today in the Taliban. It is the responsibility 
        of America's institutions of higher learning to guide us through the classical 
        history, philosophy, and poetry that have bound western civilization for 
        two millennia. This education ensures that America's polity does not become 
        what Aristotle called a &quot;slavish city&quot; that lacks the spiritedness 
        to defend itself and instead moves toward a society and culture that values 
        and celebrates patriotic heroism. <br>
