      <p><font size="5">Let words regain strength in their usage</font><br>
        <font size="2">GENEVIVE CREEDON</font></p>
      <p>We use language every day, and so we have the tendency to forget its 
        power. There is quite a bit of discussion in the educational system about 
        the language of hate and prejudice. It's a language we are born into and 
        taught, and language, whether we like it or not, becomes engrained within 
        us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We focus so much on being &quot;politically correct&quot; that we have 
        almost sought to devalue language. I am not about to argue that we should 
        go around calling people whatever names come through our minds. That's 
        quite simply unacceptable, and to perpetuate prejudice and hate through 
        language is as much a form of disrespect to ourselves as it is to others. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a generation, however, our use of language is degenerating. We make 
        a habit of using certain words and phrases over and over again, so that 
        they lose meaning. Some of our words are shocking, but we don't realize 
        their effect on other people, because their use has become habitual. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We do, however, have barriers that we don't usually venture to surpass. 
        In the classroom, our language is sophisticated. At home, our language 
        is, at least, less profane. In public encounters, our language is fairly 
        harmless. What is the difference, though? Why do we feel this need to 
        change our language for other people?<br>
      </p>
      <p>We do it out of respect, of course. We wouldn't want to utter words of 
        profanity where they do not belong, and yet, why are we so willing to 
        believe that those same words do belong in a different context? Do we 
        not owe ourselves the same respect we owe others?<br>
      </p>
      <p>The simple answer is, of course, that language is a part of our culture. 
        We curse because it's become common to curse. In many cases, the profane 
        language we use isn't even maliciously intended. It's simply stated, and 
        it carries no force. <br>
      </p>
      <p>That fact, that lack of power, is where we have cheated ourselves out 
        of one of the greatest driving forces of history and humankind. Language 
        is more than a simple form of communication. Language is the only thing 
        that creates meaning in our lives and in the world. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Without language, whether it be written or oral, we don't have much culture, 
        we don't have technology, we don't have strong relationships. We communicate 
        with language, but we think in language as well, and as Buddha says, &quot;All 
        that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world.&quot; 
        Without language, we are, in essence, nothing. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But we forget. We are taught to forget the appreciation of language, 
        because we live in a communications age. Everywhere we turn, we see language, 
        so that it becomes nothing to us, when it is, in truth, everything. If 
        we recognize the unceasing and growing role of language, we might not 
        be so quick to speak and write the way we do. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In our secular society, language is sacred, and we cannot afford to blaspheme 
        its sanctity. In denying, ignoring and even killing the importance of 
        language, we do the same to ourselves. <br>
