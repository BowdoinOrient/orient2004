      <p align="left">&quot;There's not that many places where you can go see 
        a piece of ice from the bottom of the Greenland ice cores,&quot; said 
        Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum curator Genevieve LeMoine. <br>

      <p align="left">It took five years for a team of Americans and a team of 
        Europeans to each drill two miles down into Greenland ice. In 1993 they 
        hit bedrock. The bottom ice is 400 years old. A piece of that ice is the 
        centerpiece of the Peary-MacMillan Museum's new exhibition &quot;Ancient 
        Ice, Cool Science: Climate Change in the North.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver recently put 
        out a notice to Arctic researchers that some of the ice was no longer 
        needed for study. The Bowdoin museum expressed interest and got a piece 
        for the exhibition. A standard household freezer was customized to keep 
        the ice, lit with heatless fiberoptics, under -20 degrees Celsius, while 
        a generator and your everyday, not-400-year-old ice packed underneath 
        it ensure that the ice will survive power failures. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The exhibit will run through August 2003. &quot;We wanted 
        to highlight the fact that climate is changing now and the Arctic is particularly 
        important,&quot; said LeMoine. The world's polar regions tend to be particularly 
        sensitive to climate change and are a good source for meteorological history. 
        Through testing the chemistry of the ice, the chemistry of the atmosphere 
        at the time of freezing can be discovered. Through this method major volcanic 
        eruptions can be mapped because they left sulfate in the atmosphere, and 
        use of lead can be charted, from leaded gasoline in the 20th century to 
        the extensive smelting of the Roman Empire.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A good portion of the exhibit is devoted to the Norse settlements 
        in Greenland, with a variety of artifacts. Thomas H. McGovern, Professor 
        of Anthropology at City University of New York, delivered a lecture here, 
        &quot;'Til Death Takes Us Or the World Ends: Climate Change and the Demise 
        of Norse Greenland,&quot; on November 9, the opening of the exhibition. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Following Erik the Red, Norse colonizers moved to 
        Greenland and established a typical Medieval community beginning around 
        980 A.D. This was a warm period in the North Atlantic, and the Norse settled 
        where they could find pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats. The colonists 
        survived for nearly 500 years but eventually disappeared, a casualty of 
        cooling climate coupled with a rigid, top heavy, social structure that 
        impeded adaptation,&quot; explains a placard in the exhibit. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to LeMoine, the 1300s-1400s marked the beginning 
        of the Little Ice Age, a period of global cooling. The summers more than 
        the winters killed them: with cold, wet conditions, the Norsemen could 
        not produce enough to survive the winter. The Inuit people have managed 
        to live there, but the Norse were unwilling to adapt their life style 
        to become hunter-gatherers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The exhibit compares this to 1816 in New England, known 
        as the &quot;year without a summer.&quot; The season that year was much 
        colder and drier than usual, limiting the growing season to a record 68 
        days in southern Maine and leading to widespread crop failure. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Also featured in the exhibit is 45 million year old wood, 
        which is mysteriously unpetrified - a series of unusual conditions kept 
        the wood preserved up to the point where the ice took over and it was 
        frozen in time. And dinosaur bones found in the tundra are displayed as 
        well. The polar climate was once sufficiently mild that dinosaurs could 
        live there, although the short seasons and long periods of darkness still 
        applied, therefore an environment existed that has no parallel on the 
        earth today. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Ancient Ice, Cool Science&quot; presents the work 
        of researchers from around the world, including Canada, Denmark, the United 
        States, and Bowdoin - physics professor Mark Battle, Coastal Studies Center 
        Director Anne Henshaw, and Arctic Studies Program Director Susan Kaplan. 
        Some of the new information that LeMoine is most excited about is the 
        speed of ice age transition. At the end of the last Ice Age, average temperatures 
        rose drastically and permanently in as little as 10 years. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum is open on Tuesday-Saturday 
        10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Sunday 2:00 to 5:00 p.m., closed Mondays and 
        National Holidays. <br>
