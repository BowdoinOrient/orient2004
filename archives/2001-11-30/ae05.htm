        <font size="2">JIM FLANAGAN<br>
        COLUMNIST <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">This is the last weekend of the semester that the Film Society 
        will be holding regular screenings. There is no theme for this weekend; 
        it is just the last few films we felt like showing that didn't fit into 
        any other category. As always, the films will be shown in Smith Auditorium, 
        Sills Hall, and are free and open to everyone.</p>
      <p><i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i><br>
        Friday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        This film is about a single British woman who feels like her life is getting 
        away from her. She decides to take control, and begins by starting a diary 
        in which only the absolute truth will be recorded. I don't really know 
        anything else about this movie, but it looks like a romantic comedy with 
        a love triangle between Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth. 
        I know a number of people who swear by this movie, so take their word 
        for it and check it out.</p>
      <p><i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i><br>
        Friday at 9:00 p.m.<br>
        Now this film may not be as good as the Mel Gibson remake, but is still 
        worth watching, as it is a real classic. Jimmy Stewart plays an innocent, 
        patriotic man who is appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill a vacancy left 
        by a recently deceased senator. He is chosen because he is not a politician, 
        causing a corrupt senator and a newspaper tycoon to attempt to pass a 
        bill that will make them a lot of money. Stewart drafts his own bill, 
        and must face the corrupt government as a lone, honest man. It's a timeless, 
        heartwarming film; one worth your while to view.</p>
      <p><i>Dark City </i><br>
        Saturday at 7:00 p.m.<br>
        This seems to be one of those dark, confusing films that ends up being 
        a really great movie once you sit down and finally watch it. It concerns 
        a city where there is no sun, and aliens with telekinetic powers abound, 
        experimenting on people to see what makes them human. Our main character 
        has little to no recollection of his former life, and is being hunted 
        as a wanted killer. Sounds intriguing, no? </p>
      <p><i>The Spanish Prisoner</i><br>
        Saturday at 9:00 p.m.<br>
        This is a David Mamet film about a dark corporate world. A young man develops 
        a program that will save his company a lot of money, and he wants to be 
        compensated for it. This doesn't look like it will happen, and he uses 
        a wealthy stranger to help get his boss. The wealthy man isn't as honest 
        as one would believe, and the FBI becomes involved. From there, our hero 
        gets framed for murder. I know it sounds confusing, but with Mamet's script, 
        it will make a lot more sense. Plus, Steve Martin is in the movie, and 
        he's never bad.<br>
