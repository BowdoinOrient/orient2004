        <font size="2">KARA OPPENHEIM</font></p>
      <p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; my dad said. &quot;I don't get it. You mean 
        that Missy broke up with Duncan just because she thought he was going 
        to break up with her?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Yes.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;So she ended the relationship merely to be the first one to do 
        it?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Precisely.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Just so she could beat him to it?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Yes. What don't you understand?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;How can she do that?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;People do it all the time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I don't get it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>I tried to explain to my father that it's a very common occurrence: one 
        person in a relationship suspects that the other may want to break it 
        off so he or she does it first. It happens so often that we tend to take 
        it for granted as one of many ways a relationship may be ended. But my 
        dad's incredulity made me look deeper into this institution of adolescent 
        dating. This week I question: IS IT OK TO BREAK UP WITH SOMEONE JUST TO 
        DO IT FIRST?<br>
      </p>
      <p>First of all, this method is so tried and true that it really is an institution. 
        I don't know if there was a Seinfeld episode about it or not, but if there 
        were George and Jerry would probably call it &quot;the cut-off&quot; or 
        something. &quot;We started dating, yadda, yadda, yadda, I started to 
        get sick of her and just like that she pulled a cut-off!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>As I was telling my dad, after about a month of dating, Missy began to 
        suspect that Duncan was not happy in their relationship. He became increasingly 
        distant and basically made it clear that their relationship was not high 
        on his list at the moment. Missy panicked. She was pretty sure that one 
        of these days Duncan was going to give her some line about &quot;just 
        being friends&quot; so she pulled a 'cut-off' and did it first. Of course, 
        there was no way that she could prove that he really had planned on breaking 
        up with her or not. Perhaps he just had a lot going on at the time. In 
        any case, Missy decided that it would be better for her to break up with 
        Duncan than for him to break up with her. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This probably sounds fairly common and boring. But let's examine it closer. 
        Missy and Duncan had to have started going out for some reason. From the 
        circumstances, it seems that it was probably sexual attraction, although 
        it may have been one of those relationships for the sole purpose of companionship. 
        Either way, it is fairly clear that if they hit bumps so quickly, these 
        two people probably did not really start going out because they knew each 
        other well and really cared about each other. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When Missy decided that she was pretty sure Duncan was going to break 
        up with her, she did not try to make him change his mind. Well, she may 
        have, but obviously not very hard. There was a very good chance that she 
        might get dumped. She quickly evaluated the situation and decided that 
        she cared more about not being dumped than she did about Duncan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I do not mean to disparage Missy at all. Hers is a vanity that many of 
        us share-especially at a school of such over-achievers like Bowdoin. Missy 
        understandably feared rejection. She may not have wanted to be known as 
        someone who had been dumped, she may not have wanted to give Duncan the 
        satisfaction of being in control of the fate of the relationship, or she 
        may have just thought she would not be able to handle the act of being 
        dumped. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Obviously Missy did not care all that much about Duncan and his feelings. 
        Whether or not she did at one time, there is no way she could be thinking 
        about that in dumping him. One cannot do a cut-off while in love-if you 
        truly care about someone and really want to be with them, you will try 
        to preserve the relationship and re-build it (or just build it) rather 
        than getting out. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So what do I think? Well, despite the fact that people do it all the 
        time-I certainly cannot claim innocence myself-I think it's pretty immature. 
        (Although, being a college student, I cannot completely discard immaturity 
        altogether). Obviously if someone is able to do that to someone they claim 
        to care about, they should not have been going out with them at all. They 
        may think they are being smart by beating the other person to it, but 
        perhaps it would have been smarter to end the relationship when it needed 
        to be ended and not wait until it got to the point of 'the cut-off'. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Epilogue: Missy and Duncan are both single and happier than they ever 
        were together. My dad is still confused.</p>
