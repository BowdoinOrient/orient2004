      <p align="left"><font size="3">Twenty minutes before the bus left for Boston, 
        I caught Prof. Elliott Schwartz to talk with him about his visit to Harvard. 
        We discussed the pieces that will be performed this Saturday at Lowell 
        Hall, Harvard with the Harvard Wind Ensemble and some of Bowdoin's own 
        musicians. As part of Harvard's Office for the Arts' Learning from Performers 
        program, Prof. Swchartz will be conducting seminars on music composition 
        and performance. <br>

          <td><font size="2">Professor Elliot Schwartz was chosen to be a visiting 
            instructor and performer at Harvard. (<a href="http://www.schwartzmusic.com">schwartzmusic.com</a>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">Schwartz will also perform this Saturday, 
        though he claimed, &quot;I am not a performer, but I will be performing!&quot; 
        He will make use of the Harvard's Wind Ensemble and of Bowdoin students 
        that have been carefully selected to fit the instrumentation of the piece. 
        Stacy Barron '03, John Thorndike '02, Matt Oliff '02, Hojoon &quot;David&quot; 
        Sohn '04, and Anna Wall '05 were all chosen to play clarinet, Allison 
        Robbins '02 and Rachel Berman '02 were selected for percussion, and Michael 
        Brennana '04 was picked for bass clarinet.The performance will include 
        the second movement of <i>Tribute</i>, a complex piece that some describe 
        as having &quot;trickling sounds,&quot; which was performed for the inauguration 
        of President Barry Mills. &quot;It felt like I was in the Science Museum,&quot; 
        one source said. Notably, the piece was written using English, German, 
        and French (solf&eacute;ge) music alphabets that spell B-A-R-R-Y-M-I-L-L-S. 
        <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">The program also includes <i>Aerie</i>, which 
        was written for Bowdoin students and premiered in the chapel in 1993. 
        Aerie is a special piece for Schwartz. It was composed for 6 flute players, 
        though most of the piece does not involve what is known as &quot;playing 
        flute.&quot; Musicians made &quot;sounds other than playing a flute - 
        whispers, singing, humming - and some whistling.&quot; When asked why 
        compose such a thing, Schwartz was certain, &quot;this kind of music extends 
        the resources of what's possible.&quot; <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">Playing in the line between theater and dance, 
        orchestrated chants and silence are key for Schwartz. &quot;You become 
        conscious of the players as humans, rather than faces playing an instrument.&quot; 
        Percussionist Allison Robbins agreed on its achievement. &quot;When you 
        perform Eliott's music, it's not just notes. You compose as you perform, 
        you compose with him.&quot;<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">Word has it that he recently composed a &quot;Mini 
        Concerto&quot; played in the dark while flashlights cue the performers. 
        Quite notably, he discussed a piece he composed called Hall Of Mirrors, 
        as in a &quot;fun house,&quot; he explained. It includes a sax quartet 
        and Schwartz on the piano. Impressively, the piece involves quiet sounds 
        produced by radios playing &quot;exactly what is on air at the time.&quot; 
        The careful maneuvering of these sounds demands that they play softly. 
        About three radios will be shifted in strict tempos and timing, producing 
        an effect that was first pioneered by composer John Cage. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">Specifically, Schwartz mentioned Cage's Imaginary 
        Landscape (1950s), the first piece ever performed using only radios. &quot;Like 
        a visual collage,&quot; Schwartz expressed, &quot;the piece was like a 
        random collage of sounds, producing random sounds from a live broadcasting.&quot;<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">Unfortunately, this will be the last semester 
        of full-time teaching for Prof. Swchartz. Since 1964 he has maintained 
        a tradition of walking into the music library and walking off with &quot;stuff.&quot; 
        Upon the return of the missing items, librarians were continually baffled 
        at the expiration dates of the material; sometimes, as it happened recently, 
        as late as a decade. &quot;He will be missed,&quot; Robbins said emphatically, 
        though librarians will probably throw their own concerto.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">With his brown, single-laced bag, Schwartz 
        looked confident and pleased with his involvement this coming Saturday. 
        &quot;I need to get down there and practice with the students; I haven't 
        even met them yet.&quot; <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="3">The concert will take place tomorrow at Lowell 
        Hall, Harvard College at 8:00 p.m.</font></p>
