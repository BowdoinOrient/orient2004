      <p align="left"><font size="5">Beyond the Pines: The Day JFK died</font><br>
        <font size="2">LUDWIG VAN RANG<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">As it happened, my time in the Army more or less coincided 
        with the Kennedy years. However, I used to be a great fan, as some of 
        you may remember from last year's series, of Adlai Stevenson, the Democrat 
        who twice ran for President against, and twice lost to Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
        So I wasn't all that enthusiastic about the Junior Senator from Massachusetts 
        getting the Democratic nomination for President in 1960. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jack Kennedy wasn't a true liberal, I thought. Besides, 
        I didn't much care for his Boston twang, though of course, like everyone, 
        else was impressed by his youthful good looks, and even more so by those 
        of his glamorous young wife. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">By the time Kennedy had secured the nomination at the Democratic 
        Party Convention in Los Angeles in July, 1960, I was already with the 
        Army in Germany. Most of my buddies were for Kennedy, and even without 
        TV we followed the campaign closely on AFN (the Armed Forces Network) 
        or by reading The Stars &amp; Stripes, the Army paper. In addition, I 
        read the New York Times. Kennedy was attracting large crowds it said. 
        When his motorcade passed, teenage girls in back of the crowd could be 
        seen jumping up and down to get a better view of him, an entirely new 
        and astonishing phenomenon staid 'Auntie' Times called it. Most polls 
        had Kennedy ahead of the Vice-President, if by a narrow margin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the end, it was a cliff-hanger, with the majority of 
        the popular vote much closer than in the Bush-Gore contest, and the state 
        on which everything rode was Illinois. Though sitting up all night listening 
        to the results as they came in on our fifties radio set at Rose Barracks 
        in Bad Kreuznach, we still didn't know whether or not Kennedy had won 
        by the time we were called out for reveille next morning. Illinois wasn't 
        officially called for Kennedy until 1 p.m. Central European Time the next 
        day. Though having considered asking for a recount in a number of wards 
        in Chicago, controlled by the Daly machine, Nixon finally conceded. It 
        seemed an anti-climax. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nevertheless, as the realization sank in that a man who 
        looked and acted like an overgrown college kid was the new President, 
        euphoria belatedly gripped us and the rest of the world. Young businessmen 
        in Japan were said to have broken out the champagne. A new era had dawned, 
        everyone felt, soon to be dubbed &quot;Camelot.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When Kennedy came to Germany in summer of 1963, less than 
        six months before his death, Helga and I went to Frankfurt to see him. 
        There was such a crowd, with teenagers bobbing up and down like yo-yos, 
        that we didn't get a &quot;look in,&quot; as the English say. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At my parents' in Bonn a few days later, I had a better 
        chance. I saw Kennedy slowly driving past in an open limousine, standing 
        up and holding on to a handrail like his host, Chancellor Adenauer, an 
        octogenarian with the leathery features and wily look of an Indian Chief. 
        Kennedy, by contrast, just back from a state visit to Mexico, where, just 
        as everywhere, he was cheered by hundreds of thousands lining the streets 
        of his motorcade, looked like a bronzed movie star, with his frozen grin 
        making him look like his waxwork image at Madam Toussaud's. Standing at 
        the edge of the curb, I could have reached out and touched him. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A couple of days later, JFK addressed a huge throng outside 
        West Berlin's town hall, famously declaring, Ich bin ein Berliner. He 
        had been coached how to say this by Willy Brandt, then Mayor of Berlin 
        and later Chancellor, on the flight from Bonn to Berlin. It was a message 
        meant for those on the other side of the Berlin Wall still threatening 
        the viability of the beleagured &quot;outpost of freedom.&quot; It was 
        the modern equivalent a free Roman proudly saying, <i>civitus Romanum 
        sum</i>. Everybody got the message. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Already with an eye on a second term, and in order to mend 
        political fences back home (where in some quarters they loved him less 
        it seemed than abroad) the President in November, 1963 went on his fatal 
        trip to Dallas, Texas. On Thursday, the 22nd, I was back home in Bonn, 
        after staying with my St. Tropez friends Redvers and Bradley at their 
        chic apartment in Paris. On the following Monday, I was to fly to San 
        Francisco to rejoin old Nellie (of Christmas Cove, Maine) at Carmel, California, 
        but without Helga. Instead I had my black beetle shipped to the West Coast, 
        at Nellie's expense. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">About 7 that evening, my brother phoned to say we should 
        turn the radio on, President Kennedy had been shot and seriously wounded 
        at Dallas. We did, but half an hour later everything was over. Camelot 
        had lasted less than a thousand days. The shock was profound. I cried, 
        I'm not ashamed to say. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The right-wing media have since of course done their best 
        to discredit JFK's image. Even his fans were shocked to hear of his promiscuity. 
        An English journalist, reviewing a new biography of Jackie Kennedy for 
        the liberal Observer, accuses Kennedy of &quot;indiscriminate priapism.&quot; 
        Don't bother to look the word up in the dictionary, it means &quot;persistent 
        erection.&quot; I wrote the man a letter pointing out that this was a 
        phenomenon all too familiar to men between the ages of 15 and 50, and 
        in some cases beyond. Needless to say he hasn't replied. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Three days after Dallas, I returned to the States, a country 
        in deep shock. </p>
