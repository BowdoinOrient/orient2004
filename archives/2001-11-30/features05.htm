        <font size="2">DR. JEFF BENSON<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: What's the difference between &quot;safe 
        sex&quot; and &quot;safer sex&quot;? E.T.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear E.T.: &quot;Safe sex&quot; was promoted in the early 
        '80's in response to the outbreak of the HIV epidemic. The initial lists 
        of prescribed behaviors were discouragingly long, prohibitively broad, 
        and overly focused on gay men. They were also misleading. There is no 
        such thing as completely safe sex. &quot;Safe&quot; sex recommendations 
        were eventually replaced by &quot;safer&quot; sex recommendations, grounded 
        for many in a more balanced and acceptable understanding of the nature 
        of risk.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">People have safer sex to protect themselves and their partners 
        from STD's, including HIV, and from unplanned pregnancies. They understand 
        that sex is more enjoyable if they are not afraid. Safer sex is about 
        what they do, or don't do, and not about who they are. It is about figuring 
        out their own &quot;risk limits, ' and then avoiding sexual activities 
        that fall outside of them. Safer sex practices require self-reflection, 
        a great deal of communication between partners, and some familiarity with 
        the &quot;tools of the trade,&quot; especially condoms. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Condoms greatly reduce the risk of contracting or spreading 
        many STD's, including HIV. They are available in a truly astonishing array 
        of styles, colors, sizes, shapes, and flavors. Most are made of latex. 
        For people allergic to latex (some 6 percent of the population), polyurethane 
        condoms are good alternatives. &quot;Natural&quot; lambskin condoms should 
        be avoided: they don't protect against viruses.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A good quality condom, properly used, is a birth control 
        method with a failure rate of about only 2 percent. In our real world, 
        however, this rate is more like 12 percent. Go Ask Alice! estimates that 
        2-5 percent of condoms tear during use. Causes include creating microscopic 
        tears with rings or fingernails, not using enough lube, or not using the 
        right lube (water- or glycerin-based like Astroglide or KY, not oil-based 
        like Vaseline or massage oil). The majority of condom failures are probably 
        due to inconsistent or incorrect use. Inconsistent condom use may mean 
        not using a new condom every time, or not putting it on soon enough. Incorrect 
        condom use may involve not fully unrolling the condom, or unrolling it 
        backwards, or not leaving space at the tip and squeezing the air out (&quot;pinch 
        an inch!&quot;) Condoms should be stored in a cool, dry place, and not 
        carried around for long in a pocket or wallet.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That 12 percent user-failure rate is the reason condoms 
        should always be used with another contraceptive agent (such as foam, 
        jelly, or sponges). Many condoms are coated with a spermicide (usually 
        Nonoxynol-9), but this small amount is not considered adequate to prevent 
        pregnancy in the event of condom failure. Moreover, Nonoxynol-9 may have 
        been shown to facilitate HIV transmission. None of the condoms now distributed 
        by the Health Center contain N-9. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Reality&quot; brand condoms are placed into the vagina 
        or anus before sex. Although often called &quot;female condoms,&quot; 
        they can obviously used by men or women.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dental dams, plastic wrap, and flavored or cut condoms can 
        all be used to make oral sex safer. The point is to avoid exchange of 
        body fluids.<br>
        Health educators at the Fenway Clinic in Boston have suggested we think 
        through the risks of sex and safer sex like we do other risks in life, 
        such as driving a car. There are people who choose not to drive for fear 
        of getting hurt in an accident. Most people seem willing to accept some 
        level of risk, and try to find ways to reduce it. They wear seat belts, 
        maintain their cars, drive defensively, and avoid driving after drinking 
        or in bad weather.<br>
        Practicing safer sex is really very similar.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">You can, of course, choose abstinence. Obviously, that would 
        be the safest option. For some people, it's the best choice. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is plenty of information readily available to help 
        you make your own best choices. Take a look at the Health Center web page.

        Resource Center. Talk to members of the Bowdoin Gay/Straight Alliance
