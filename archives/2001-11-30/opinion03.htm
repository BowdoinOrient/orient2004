      <p><font size="5">Forum: Was the revised Thanksgiving Break calendar successful?</font><br>
      </p>
      <p><i>This year's academic calendar was the first in which classes were 
        officially not held on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. This was the 
        result of a student government initiative approved by the faculty and 
        administration last year, responding to common complaints that students 
        who live far away had little time to travel home for the holiday. The 
        calendar committee has made it clear that this is only a temporary change 
        and future calendars will depend on how faculty felt this trial year went. 
        <br>

      <p><i>Here's what a few faculty and staff members had to say about last 
        week's break.</i></p>

      The Thanksgiving calendar revision worked fine in my MWF courses. Attendance 
      on Monday before Thanksgiving was 80 percent in one course and 100 percent 
      in the other. The Monday after Thanksgiving, it was 100 percent in both 
      courses.<br>
      The big question, I imagine, is how attendance in Tuesday classes was affected. 
      That will give us a better idea about the seriousness of &quot;break creep.&quot;

      I allow my students one unexcused absence during the course of the semester. 
      About 70 percent of my students chose to take the Tuesday before Thanksgiving 
      break as their personal day. Although the Administration tried vigilantly 
      to discourage &quot;break creep,&quot; a two-day academic week is a rather 
      impractical concept. So is having class the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, 
      which makes traveling home very difficult. <br>
      I suggest that we steal two days from the five-week long winter break and 
      take a full week off for Thanksgiving. That would provide students and faculty 
      a substantial time period to travel home, rest, and get prepared for the 
      final two weeks of classes and fall exams.

      Monday of last week became the Wednesday of previous pre-Thanksgiving weeks 
      (sparse class attendance, etc.), so little was gained by the switch. Besides, 
      scheduling an extra class to make up for the Wednesday holiday is a hassle. 
      I'd vote to go back to having scheduled classes on the Wednesday before 
      Thanksgiving.

      All of my students attended class on the Monday before Thanksgiving. I think 
      it's because presentations were scheduled and they were being graded. The 
      Monday after Thanksgiving, two students were absent due to travel .

      All my students stayed for Monday class. Not a problem. Now how about extending 
      the end of classes a day to pick up the slack, or have a shorter reading 
      period?

      I vote to continue-the students we were seeing at the Health Center before 
      the break definitely needed a good break!
