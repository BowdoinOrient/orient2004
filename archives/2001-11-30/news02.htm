      <p align="left">With the announcement by the National Bureau of Economic 
        Research this past week that the United States officially entered a recession, 
        the worst fears about the US economy have finally been realized. This 
        announcement signaled the end of a decade of robust economic expansion 
        that has been felt even in America's most distant corners, including Bowdoin. 
        Bowdoin will soon be feeling the pressures of recession, and the employees 
        of the college are going take the brunt of the fall. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ten years ago, Bowdoin experienced a budget crisis, often 
        finding itself with year-end deficits that mimicked the larger the US 
        economy. With the period of domestic growth, Bowdoin has benefited from 
        nine consecutive balanced budgets, and hopefully a tenth to follow soon. 
        Because of its recent ability to balance revenues and costs, Bowdoin students 
        and faculty have enjoyed increased benefits, including generous salary 
        increases. Bowdoin employees, including the faculty, have been rewarded 
        by Bowdoin's ability to increase health coverage. However, with the downward 
        trends of the last year, it will be impossible to maintain both generous 
        increases in pay and health benefits. To deal with this crisis, Bowdoin 
        has decided that it must begin to cut corners. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Kent Chabotar, Vice President for Finance and 
        Administration and Treasurer, the cost of employee health insurance has 
        increased 30 percent over the past year. For this fiscal year, Bowdoin 
        will spend $5 million on employee coverage. $4 million of that amount 
        is covered directly by the College through the budget, and the employees 
        of the College pay the other $1 million. Chabotar emphasized that Bowdoin 
        is not the only employer in Maine to feel these increases; the entire 
        state is dealing with skyrocketing health insurance costs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The problem is only compounded further when one considers 
        that the amount of money coming into the College is lessening. Bowdoin, 
        like many others in Maine, is now forced to pay higher costs with a smaller 
        budget. Bowdoin has three primary sources of income: tuition and fees, 
        the endowment, and annual giving. Because of decreased returns on the 
        endowment's investments, Bowdoin took a hit when the endowment figures 
        came in $80 million less than expected. The endowment totaled $420 million 
        instead of the $500 million predicted. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To determine the annual budget, Bowdoin takes 5 percent 
        of the endowment and sets that number as the yearly budget. Bowdoin's 
        new budget will be $4 million short of what was predicted. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To compensate for the lower budget numbers, Chabotar sums 
        up Bowdoin's strategy as having to &quot;trim here and there.&quot; Unfortunately 
        for many, this trimming will come by reducing salary increases, which 
        are being slashed for most of the 550 non-faculty employees from the usual 
        4 percent increase to only 2 percent. The 150 faculty members will likely 
        see their pay raises stay at typical levels of 4-6 percent. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cuts in health care form the other side of the equation, 
        with coverage reducing for employees. Tim Foster, Senior Associate Dean 
        of Student Affairs, calms any fears about student reductions: &quot;Student 
        health coverage will not be affected because it is covered by a student 
        health fee, which pays for a policy that the College buys from Commercial 
        Travelers [Insurance Company].&quot; Conversely, the College covers employee 
        insurance, so cost increases are more detrimental. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Health insurance costs for employees vary because they tend 
        to age during their tenure at Bowdoin. Aging brings costs that student 
        coverage never considers, as Chabotar jokes, &quot;For some reason the 
        student population never ages.&quot; In spite of the fact that they will 
        be spending more on healthcare, employees will see their coverage reduced 
        (i.e. full coverage would be reduced to 90 percent or 90 percent coverage 
        to 80 percent). For now, however, the there are no definite answers as 
        to the size of reductions, but they will certainly occur. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kent Chabotar, who has overseen Bowdoin's nine consecutive 
        balanced budgets, believes that Bowdoin is on track for the future. Bowdoin 
        was facing sharply increasing costs over the next decade, which Chabotar 
        has attempted to remedy by lowering expenditures in the short term. By 
        doing this, Bowdoin hopes to lower the trajectory of expected costs. The 
        cost-cutting measures of today may be long forgotten if this plan is successful, 
        as the College will have more money compounding interest for future revenues. 
        With these new plans, Bowdoin has been able to cut $1.8 million in costs 
        for this year's and next year's estimated budgets. They now have $1.8 
        million more earning interest for the future.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Because of the unstable situation with the US economy, predicting 
        how the College's budget will react is difficult. Kent Chabotar reassures 
        students and faculty that the College is hardly in a crisis but is merely 
        feeling the strain that most Americans are beginning to feel. Regardless, 
        the effects of the recession are soon to be felt on the campus of Bowdoin. 
        These effects may actually hurt the employees of the College more than 
        the students, but with constantly changing predictions, the entire community 
        may find their fears manifested in the near future as their wallets begin 
        to thin. <br>
