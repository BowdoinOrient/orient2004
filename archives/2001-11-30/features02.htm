        <font size="2">CONOR WILLIAMS</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">Last Tuesday afternoon, Bowdoin's Environmental Studies 
        Department hosted President and CEO of the New England Aquarium in Boston, 
        MA, Dr. Jerry R. Schubel. His talk centered around an upcoming effort 
        to take a Census of Marine Life (CoML), and the current state of the Gulf 
        of Maine, a project he helped initiate. Schubel holds degrees from Alma 
        College and Harvard University, as well as a Ph. D in Oceanography from 
        Johns Hopkins University. His talk was entitled, &quot;Scientists &amp; 
        the Future of the Gulf of Maine: What Roles Should They Play?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Where you see scientists,&quot; Schubel said, &quot;I 
        want you to read not just natural and physical scientists, but social 
        scientists as well.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Schubel went on to assert that the Gulf of Maine will be 
        an &quot;environmental battlefield&quot; over the next decade. Historically, 
        the Gulf has been commercially overexploited; the regional extermination 
        of cod, puffins, and the near extinction of the right whale are salient 
        examples. Such usage in the past has hurt the coast's &quot;sense of place,&quot; 
        according to Schubel. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Without the fishing villages, I don't think it would 
        be Maine,&quot; he said, &quot;and without fishing, there would be no 
        fishing villages&#133;the 'sense of place' is as much a function of human 
        activities as nature's.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For Schubel, this is justification for conscientious monitoring 
        and ecosystem management in the Gulf. He used a theatrical analogy to 
        portray the Gulf, with individual species, including humans, playing their 
        parts on a stage unique in the world represented by the Gulf's special 
        composition. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The Gulf has all the elements of great theatre,&quot; 
        said Schubel, citing the many ecosystem changes and large tidal variations 
        as plot twists, and humans as the complex leading characters in the &quot;play,&quot; 
        alternating between villains and heroes. The interactions between the 
        environment and its non-human and human inhabitants foreshadow towards 
        the end of the play, Schubel noted. Still, the outcome is very much a 
        continual finish, as adaptive behavior can always affect the consequences. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This is a very dynamic system. Very stressful,&quot; 
        said Schubel &quot;Life [in the Gulf of Maine] favors the generalist, 
        rather than the specialist&#133;If you're gonna live in the Gulf of Maine, 
        you'd better be a generalist, so you can cope with dramatic changes in 
        the environment.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the same time, Schubel noted that the systems in the 
        Gulf are very &quot;tough and resilient,&quot; and are conducive to human 
        management. In order to ensure that the &quot;play&quot; ends satisfactorily, 
        he has joined with other leading oceanographic experts in advocating the 
        CoML project, a ten-year, one billion dollar project. This will help answer 
        three questions: &quot;What lived in the sea before significant human 
        impacts?&quot;, &quot;What lives in the sea?&quot;, and &quot;What will 
        live in the sea?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">From these, Schubel hopes that inferences can be made concerning 
        the interactions between different groups of animals and their environment 
        as well. <br>
        This project will begin with a pilot program in the Gulf of Maine, involving 
        &quot;smart buoys,&quot; radar, and satellite imaging, under the heading 
        of the Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS). Ideally, this program 
        will be continued across the globe as the Global Ocean Observing System 
        (GOOS). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Schubel concluded his talk with a challenge to the audience 
        and the Bowdoin community to initiate an &quot;aquatic forum&quot; on 
        campus as a mechanism for the development of a Marine Protection Area 
        (MPA) for the Gulf. He believes that the College could take a leadership 
        role in what he feels will be a contentious issue in the near future. 
        Such MPAs allow for societal management of aquatic resources based on 
        expert opinion acquired in the aforementioned forum. The key to this is 
        maintaining open communications between contending interests and persistence 
        in developing compromises. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Society has a role in deciding what we want the Gulf 
        of Maine to be,&quot; he said.<br>
