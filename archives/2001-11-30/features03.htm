        <font size="2">ERIC DIAMON<br>
        STAFF WRITER <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Editor's note: This article was originally published 
        in the </i>Times Record <i>on September 24, 2001.</i></p>
      <p align="left">Noxious smells, a high danger of disease, and rampant drug 
        abuse and crime await Hanley Denning each morning at her office in Guatemala 
        City, Guatemala.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She is founder and director of Safe Passage, a support program 
        trying to help the poorest and most at-risk of Guatemala's children break 
        out of poverty through education. The program is on the outskirts of the 
        garbage dump here in a small white church on loan from a local parish. 
        Prior to opening in December 1999, several weeks were spent cleaning and 
        painting the church as it was infested with cockroaches, flies and mold.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Instead of allowing the setting to frustrate her, it challenges 
        and motivates Denning.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Some of these kids,&quot; she said, &quot;it's unbelievable, 
        the things that they do. They get up, living in a cardboard home - no 
        water, no lights but they do get up every morning.&quot; According to 
        Denning, children also lack emotional support at home due to the high 
        rate of parental drug addiction.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To counter this, the center provides some stability that 
        many of these children do not experience at home. &quot;The tiny church 
        has become our project's base,&quot; said Denning, &quot;and serves as 
        a refuge for the many children who come to us each day in search of food, 
        caring and attention.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1997 she arrived in Guatemala to work at the program, 
        God's Child in Antigua, but she knew almost no Spanish. She had a degree 
        from Bowdoin College. She had sold all of her possessions, including her 
        car, computer and furniture. She had the experiences of working as a teacher 
        at the Foundation for Children with AIDS in Roxbury, Mass., and at a Head 
        Start program in North Carolina.<br>
        &quot;It was very difficult,&quot; she said. &quot;The first day I got 
        off the plane, there was someone waiting for me with the name of the program, 
        'God's Child', on a sign. I was only able to say 'Hola.' I felt so childish 
        and had so much to ask.&quot;<br>
        After studying Spanish for several months in an intensive immersion program, 
        Denning began her work with God's Child.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I had a caseload of 90 kids,&quot; she said of her 
        work teaching children in Antigua. &quot;Over the course of a year, I 
        got more and more involved with the kids and they just really captured 
        my heart. I got very involved with the families and I ended up staying 
        for three years.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This work helped lay the foundation for Safe Passage, the 
        project she began in December 1999, after having been invited to Guatemala 
        City to tour the garbage dump, a location where many families live. During 
        the day and evening, family members search the dump for food and other 
        essentials.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I was gonna head back to the states, but a nun and 
        friend invited me to come to the Guatemala City Garbage Dump. I was nervous 
        and hesitant walking through the dump, but in talking with children I 
        was amazed how many children weren't in school,&quot; Denning said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She had mixed feelings as to what she could do to help.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I thought that I could set up something part-time 
        helping 15 children,&quot; she continued, &quot;but that idea lasted one 
        week and 60 children came. I realized that this had to be full-time, all 
        or nothing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So with a $5,000 grant in hand, Denning and volunteers created 
        a drop?in reinforcement program for children not attending school.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Just over a year-and?a-half old, the project still gobbles 
        up her time. &quot;The program is challenging and all consuming,&quot; 
        she said, &quot;especially because I love what I'm doing. I have long, 
        long hours.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A typical day involves getting up at 5:30 a.m. and making 
        a to-do list. By 6:15 a.m. Denning's on the bus from Antigua to Guatemala 
        City. Arriving to the project's center around 8 a.m., she meets with the 
        assistant director and then from 8:30?9:30 a.m. there's a staff meeting 
        with the 12 staff members and six volunteers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The rest of the day is spent doing outreach work, talking 
        with program sponsors and supervising. Denning then leaves the city by 
        7 p.m. and returns home around 8:30 p.m. She does office work until about 
        11:30 p.m. before heading to bed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the project progresses, Denning is learning to delegate 
        more and to make the project more locally run.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;More and more, I'm setting it up so that local leadership 
        is in place,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm training a Guatemalan to be the 
        assistant director.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even though the project is still early in its existence, 
        Denning and the other workers and volunteers have witnessed great successes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;There are so many obstacles, but none of our students 
        have dropped out of school,&quot; she said. &quot;One student that comes 
        to mind was getting 30s and 40s on tests last year, but is now getting 
        90s.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She added that a student cannot flunk out of the program. 
        &quot;We take into consideration the student's background,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Growing up in Yarmouth and attending Bowdoin College, Denning 
        knew she wanted to go overseas and experience other cultures. But nothing 
        in Maine prepared her for the work she is doing, she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I've lived and worked among the poor in Guatemala 
        for the past four years, but nothing prepared me for the horrors I saw 
        in the Guatemala City garbage dump,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While she didn't have too much real-life preparation for 
        what she was about see in Guatemala City, she had always wanted to help 
        those in trouble.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I worked for Shoreline (Community Mental Health) in 
        Brunswick doing outreach with homeless people,&quot; she said, adding 
        that her commitment to help others is a Denning family value. &quot;And 
        working in Roxbury was a huge turning point.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Denning's ability to adapt to different situations has helped 
        her greatly to continue to build the program. From the 15 students she 
        had originally envisioned back in 1999, Safe Passage now helps more than 
        230 children. But not just every student who applies is accepted. &quot;We 
        try to take in the most at?risk children,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Once in the program, children are offered everything from 
        tutoring assistance to financial assistance with purchasing the required 
        - and expensive - school uniforms.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Support for the children occurs year-round and at the start 
        of each school year, in addition to uniform costs, children also receive 
        enrollment fees, shoes and school supplies. Funding of this project is 
        a constant challenge said Denning.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;We try to have sponsors link with individual children 
        and try to keep the sponsor informed about the project,&quot; she said, 
        noting that they have roughly 130 sponsors who contribute a monthly donation 
        to the project. Safe Passage recommends $25 each month, but the program 
        eagerly accepts school supplies.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We teach the students that the assistance is earned 
        and that school is their job. They can earn supplies and food for their 
        family. It's sort of an economic incentive,&quot; Donning said, adding 
        that for parents, it's a sacrifice to send children to school because 
        children either take care of younger siblings or help work in the dump.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Denning shared one story of a girl she encountered while 
        doing outreach in the dump. The story is typical of many children here, 
        she said. &quot;(The 9-year-old girl) was in charge of raising her little 
        sister, staying with her all day, because single mothers work very hard 
        out in the dump,&quot; she said. &quot;They have no one to take care of 
        their children so the child becomes the caretaker for his or her younger 
        siblings. It's a sacrifice.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Denning's goal is for children to go &quot;at least through 
        high school. Having graduated from high school, they can go on to be a 
        secretary, teacher, social worker. Their parents' lives are so much defined 
        by a day?to?day struggle far survival and I want these kids to be able 
        to see beyond that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Participation in the program requires strict adherence to 
        the rules. Students must go to school unless excused for a legitimate 
        reason. School lasts half the day, with some students going in the morning 
        and others in the afternoon.<br>
        When students are not in school, they go to the project. There, children 
        are helped with homework, offered art instruction and provided with outdoor 
        activities. &quot;Volunteers are trying to help students move away from 
        copying like machines and move toward understanding educational concepts,&quot; 
        said Donning.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The program also provides lunch to both the morning group 
        and afternoon group. &quot;We serve 230 lunches a day,&quot; she continued, 
        &quot;which is usually the only real meal many kids receive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The program also offers weekend activities such as athletics 
        to help keep children out of trouble.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Project work is hard but necessary, in Denning's eyes. On 
        top of it all, she tries to take care of herself. &quot;I'm trying to 
        connect with others around me and also some not associated with the program,&quot; 
        she said. &quot;I also like to run and go to the beach.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Beyond exhaustion, Safe Passage volunteers face another 
        problem: both the project's buildings are on loan. That means no long-term 
        security.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dealing with all that and more is not exactly what she anticipated 
        upon coming to Guatemala in 1997. But for Denning, that's part of the 
        journey. &quot;This project has shown me that you need to follow your 
        heart, your gut, especially people that dismiss their ability to do something,&quot; 
        she said. &quot;I learned to be flexible and open and said to myself, 
        'Maybe this isn't the path I initially planned for myself from when I 
        left Bowdoin and that's somewhat scary at first, but good, too.&quot;'<br>
