      <p>The Bowdoin Men's Basketball Team has gotten off to a hot start this 
        winter, winning three of its first four contests.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Last year, the team missed postseason play by just a single game. However, 
        if the men's early play is any indication, it will be hard to keep the 
        Polar Bears out of title contention this year.<br>

      <p>The Polar Bears opened their season two weeks ago at the University of 
        Rochester Tournament on November 16 and 17. The team played two games 
        that weekend, against Alfred University and the University of Rochester. 
        The Polar Bears were victorious against Alfred by a score of 81-67, but 
        fell 85-67 to Rochester in the tournament's championship game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Polar Bears returned to Bowdoin for their home opener on November 
        20 against the University of New England. They made easy work of UNE, 
        coming away with an impressive 93-63 victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After taking a rest over the Thanksgiving holiday, the team resumed play 
        on November 27 against the University of Southern Maine. The game ended 
        61-59 in Bowdoin's favor, secured by some clutch free throws made by senior 
        guards Greg Orlicz and Mark Gilbride. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Polar Bear team has five senior captains this season. Four of those 
        seniors-Hugh Coleman, Scott Jamieson, Gilbride, and Orlicz-are guards, 
        while Chris Ranslow, currently the team's leading scorer, plays forward.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While the team's depth in the backcourt is certainly a valuable strength, 
        contributions have come from a number of team members. Three players have 
        averaged more than ten points a game (Ranslow, Orlicz, and Braden Clement 
        '03), and the men have demonstrated an unselfish ability to distribute 
        the ball and play as a cohesive unit. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coach Tim Gilbride, who returns for his 17th year as a Bowdoin coach, 
        is both pleased and excited by the talent within his 2001-2 team. With 
        great athleticism all around, Gilbride said that he expects the men to 
        play with a pressing and running style that promises to offer exciting 
        basketball for fans in Morrell Gym this year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Gilbride highlighted the strengths of several players, calling Coleman 
        an &quot;instant scorer&quot; who can play both guard positions. Orlicz, 
        another senior guard, has &quot;exceptional speed and can score by driving 
        by defenders,&quot; Gilbride said. <br>
        The coach also added that he has been impressed with Ranslow's versatility. 
        &quot;He is very effective in scoring at the post position, and is also 
        an outstanding rebounder.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>While quite pleased with the team's early successes, Gilbride indicated 
        that he has his eyes on the big picture. According to him, since the NESCAC 
        is a very competitive league, the team will take this season &quot;one 
        game at a time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team competes in the Bates/Bowdoin Basketball Classic this weekend, 
        traveling to Lewiston to play Suffolk University at 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. 
        <br>
        On Sunday, the Polar Bears return to Bowdoin to face off with Thomas College 
        at 3:00 p.m..<br>
