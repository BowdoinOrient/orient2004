      <p> Getting into the holiday spirit, the college football gods have given 
        the nation a weekend for which to be thankful. The University of Colorado 
        derailed the Nebraska Cornhusker's national championship hopes, while 
        Oklahoma State thwarted the Oklahoma Sooners' bid to repeat as national 
        champions.<br>
        However, this weekend's heroics are belittled and rendered relatively 
        insignificant, courtesy of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). <br>
      </p>
      <p>But, how is that possible? Two of the greatest upsets of the 2001 season 
        occurred during the same weekend - the entire national championship picture 
        collapsed in the matter of days, as underdogs and underachievers dethroned 
        potential champions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Colorado running back Chris Brown rushed for 198 yards and six touchdowns 
        against one of the stingiest defenses in college football. Overall, CU 
        piled up 582 yards of total offense and scored an unprecedented 62 points 
        against the Cornhuskers, who previously had never allowed such an offensive 
        explosion in school history.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Buff's 62-34 victory may even have been one of the biggest college 
        football upset of the decade - after all, I was nine-years-old the last 
        time the Huskers lost to the Buffs.<br>

            <p><font size="2"> <b>Jordan Watch</b>: After playing against His 
              Airness, 76'er Allen Iverson told the press, &quot;I expected him 
              to be better than what he's doing right now.&quot; The question 
              is: Does Jordan?<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">MJ is averaging 25.7 points, 4.9 assists, and 2.07 
              steals - which is a full and impressive stat line. However, he is 
              shooting a career-worst .402 from the field and is clearly incapable 
              of making the Wizards contenders. To use a very terrible pun, he's 
              no magician&#133;or wizard.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">With Washington struggling as a 4-10 team, many 
              athletes and analysts cannot fathom why Jordan returned. As Iverson 
              said, he is clearly not the same player who was the most idolized 
              ball player in the world. He is a mirage of his former self. He 
              is still an all-star, but he's not a super star anymore.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">FYI: Jordan is quite aware. Michael knew that he 
              no player in the league - not even Michael Jordan - could transform 
              the woeful Wizards into a contender. But, Jordan hates to lose. 
              <br>
              Jordan's first act as general manager and owner was to ship all 
              over the high salary, underachieving veterans elsewhere. His second 
              act was to sign the top free agent in the league: Michael Jordan.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">As a player, he can coach and inspire young players, 
              like Kwane Brown. Additionally, he can attract top-notch free agent 
              talent. What basketball player doesn't want to play with Michael 
              Jordan? <br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Someday, Jordan will look back upon his second comeback 
              and smile - after the Wizards become one of the most dominant basketball 
              franchises in the NBA.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><b><font size="2">Who likes short shorts?</font></b><font size="2"> 
              Shaquille O'Neal does. After NBA Commissioner David Stern slapped 
              the seven-footer with a $5000 dollar fine for wearing shorts too 
              short, Shaq declared that he was not about to wear &quot;John Stockton 
              shorts.&quot;<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">At 6'1&quot; and weighing 175 pounds, the 39-year-old 
              Stockton wears the tight shorts reminiscent of 1980s basketball 
              players. After hearing Shaq's comment, Stockton shipped a pair of 
              his Jazz shorts to the big man.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">On Tuesday night, O'Neal humored Stockton and the 
              media by emerging for pre-game warm-ups in the shorts with a waist 
              size of 32 inches. To put it into perspective, Shaq's regular game 
              shorts have a 52-inch waist.<br>
              Flaunting the skin-tight shorts, Shaq looked to the cameras and 
              asked, &quot;Are these better, Stern?&quot;<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><b>Mark Cuban looking for someone to care</b>: Mark 
              Cuban, a dot.com billionaires and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, 
              recently declared that he would like to be the first owner to earn 
              a technical foul during a game.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Last season, Cuban was a favorite target for Stern 
              who fined the owner monthly for criticizing officials, sitting on 
              the bench during the game, and running onto the court to break up 
              a fight, to name a few.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Mark, we love it when an owner sporting a Dallas 
              Stars jersey runs onto the court to break up a fight - even if you 
              stopped dead in your tracks when you realized that all the players 
              were a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">But, why do you want to get a T? Charging the court 
              to protect one of your players is characterized as love for the 
              team. Trying to earn yourself a T is a narcissistic and childish 
              act. Plus, I am sure your players and coach would be less than enthusiastic.

      <p>The contest between the Sooners and Cowboys, however, was a defensive 
        battle - an unheard of concept at Folsom Field where CU and Nebraska combined 
        for over one thousand yards of total offense. <br>
        With 1:36 left in the fourth quarter, Cowboys QB Josh Fields found Rashaun 
        Woods open in the end zone. With one monumental pass, the Sooners' dreams 
        of back-to-back national titles crumbled, as the Cowboys earned a 16-13 
        victory.<br>
        And yes, I am telling that these two upsets are relatively insignificant. 
      </p>
      <p>Before I receive angry letters from Cowboys and Buffaloes fans, let me 
        explain my position. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The BCS, with its mystifying statistical analysis of the top 15 teams 
        in Division 1-A football, picks a handful of teams to be favorites for 
        the national championship before the season ever begins. As a result, 
        certain teams who are statistically favored by the BCS have a greater 
        chance to play in the championship bowl than the majority of football 
        teams out there.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Cowboys and Buffaloes are the spoilers, but they were never considered 
        as national champion contenders. But, the Cowboys are 4-7 and Buffs are 
        9-2 you might point out - surely, they don't deserve to be championship 
        contenders.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But, what about Brigham Young University? With an 11-0 record, BYU is 
        ranked twelfth according to the BCS due to its supposedly weak schedule. 
        Essentially, the school is penalized for playing in the Mountain West 
        Division with schools like San Diego State, Wyoming, and Utah.<br>
        The University of Colorado, making its home in the Big 12, is actually 
        ranked above BYU despite its two losses because it has a statistically 
        harder schedule. What is this madness? How does the BCS put out the rankings?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Basically, the BCS is a big math equation that claims to be scientific, 
        but is actually highly biased. Imagine: A + B + C + D = ranking.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Part A is called the &quot;computer average.&quot; The computer computes 
        a simple average of eight poll rankings as assigned by sports analysts 
        throughout the nation. Guys like Jeff Sagarin of USA Today and Peter Wolfe 
        rank the top fifteen teams subjectively.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Part B is &quot;schedule rank.&quot; Because I am sociology major and 
        not a math major perhaps I am alone in my failure to understand this logic 
        presented by the BCS: &quot;Rank of schedule strength compared to other 
        Division 1-A teams of actual games played divided by 25.&quot; The BCS 
        then makes some allusion to won/loss records as compared to opponents.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Part C is fairly easily: &quot;losses.&quot; Each team receives one point 
        (think golf - this point is bad) for each loss of the season.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Part D, &quot;Quality Win Component,&quot; is equally as vague and subjective 
        as Part C. According to the BCS, &quot;The bonus scale will range from 
        a high of 1.5 for a win over the top-ranked team to a low of .1 for a 
        victory over the 15th-ranked BCS team.&quot; Now, think basketball: points 
        are good in this case.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The two teams with the highest BCS rankings get to play in the national 
        championship bowl, which this year in the Rose Bowl presented by AT&amp;T. 
        Overall, BCS controls the bids to four bowls: the Rose Bowl, the Tostitos 
        Fiesta Bowl, the Nokia Sugar Bowl, and the FedEx Orange With Nebraska 
        and Oklahoma out of the picture, the likely match-up is Miami versus Florida 
        for the national championship.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And why must college football fans endure this crazy system that claims 
        to pick out a national contender? In 1998, the BCS was first adopted in 
        order to create a unified champ; with the AP Poll, Coaches Poll, as well 
        as others, the national champ was always an ambiguous term.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, this BCS solution, which will run through 2005, is biased, boring, 
        and corporate-motivated. The most obvious way to insure a competitive 
        and merit-based national championship is through a playoff system.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Could you imagine college basketball adopting a similar postseason standard 
        as football? Fans love March Madness and love watching a number 16-seeded 
        team challenge a number one-seeded team in round one. Plus, when Duke 
        cut down the nets last year, there was no dispute that they were the best 
        team in the nation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, collegiate football is reluctant to adopt a similar postseason 
        alternative due to the big money tied to bowl games. Can you imagine if 
        Division 1-A football chose 32 teams to participate in the post season 
        with brackets similar to that of college basketball. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Such a system mandates that five extra football games would be played 
        at the end of the season; therefore, it is implausible, right?. Wrong. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Many teams wait an entire month between the end of its 11-game regular 
        season and bowl game. Why not pack five games into that month? BYU might 
        even have a chance to be national champs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, this will not happen as long as corporate greed controls college 
        football postseason play. Just look at the names of some of the bowl games: 
        galleyfurniture.com Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, Capital One Florida Citrus 
        Bowl, Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, and Nokia Sugar Bowl. In addition to the sponsorship, 
        advertisers get a three-hour window to present their products to the American 
        public.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Last year, 127 million people watched the four BCS bowls - all of those 
        viewers translate into big bucks for networks as well as corporations 
        who advertise and sponsor these contests.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But, shouldn't sports be a pure enterprise - a meritocracy based on performance? 
        Unfortunately, there is simply too much money involved to overhaul a failing 
        system. Universities, corporations, and advertisers win big according 
        to this set-up.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Student athletes and fans lose big time. Who is this game for anyways?<br>
