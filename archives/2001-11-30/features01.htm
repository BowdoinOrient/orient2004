      <p align="left"><font size="5">Arsenic in drinking water: How much is too much?</font><br>
        <font size="2">A. MYRICK FREEMAN III</font><font size="2"><br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">Many observers were surprised when President Bush's Environmental 
        Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced that it would uphold the 80% 
        reduction in the maximum allowed concentration of arsenic in public drinking 
        water supplies first announced by the Clinton administration last January. 
        The reason for the surprise was that EPA announced last March that it 
        was blocking implementation of the Clinton standard pending reviews of 
        the basic science and the analyses of the benefits and costs of the proposed 
        standard. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since EPA's own analysis showed that the quantifiable benefits 
        of the proposed standard were outweighed by its costs, and because President 
        Bush's appointees to environmental posts generally supported the use of 
        benefit-cost analysis in environmental decision making, it was widely 
        believed that Christine Todd Whitman, Bush's appointee as Administrator 
        of EPA, would use this review as an opportunity to justify a less protective 
        standard for arsenic in drinking water.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bush decision has not settled the controversy over the 
        standard. Opponents of stricter controls announced that they would fight 
        the decision to implement the Clinton standard. And environmental organizations 
        such as the Natural Resources Defense Council announced that they would 
        fight for an even stricter standard. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Economists would argue that if we are to make the most of 
        our scarce resources, we should compare what we receive from environmental 
        protection activities in the form of increased well-being with what we 
        give up by taking resources from other uses. We could measure the values 
        of what we gain (the benefits) and what we lose (the costs). We could 
        undertake environmental protection only if the results are worth more, 
        in terms of individuals' values, than what is given up by diverting resources 
        from other uses.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The standard for arsenic has been at 50 parts per billion 
        (ppb) since 1942. The Clinton proposal, now accepted by Ms. Whitman, is 
        to lower the standard to 10 ppb. There is substantial evidence from exposed 
        populations in some developing countries (rural Taiwan, Chile) that drinking 
        water containing arsenic in the range of 500 ppb results in a significant 
        increase in the risk of cancer. What is not known is whether there is 
        a threshold concentration below which there is essentially no risk, or 
        whether lower concentrations result in proportionately lower, but still 
        positive risks of cancer.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Assuming a proportionately lower risk (no threshold), EPA 
        estimated that the benefits of a 10 ppb standard would be between $140-200 
        million per year, while it would cost about $206 million per year to meet 
        this standard. Opponents of reducing the standard from the present 50 
        ppb point to this excess of costs over benefits. They also say that the 
        benefits could be zero, since it is likely that there is a threshold for 
        arsenic at some level well above 10 ppb. Supporters of the proposed standard 
        say that it is likely that there are other adverse health effects besides 
        cancer and that it is worth the extra cost as a safety margin. Some also 
        argue that it is immoral to make policy decisions on the basis of benefit-cost 
        analysis when people's lives are at stake.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The most vocal opponents of the 10 ppb standard are the 
        elected and appointed officials in those cities where drinking water presently 
        contains more than 10 ppb of arsenic and whose citizens would have to 
        bear the costs of meeting the new standard. Most of the arsenic in public 
        water supplies is of natural origins. There is no set of &quot;black hat&quot; 
        polluters who arguably should be made to bear the cost of cleaning up 
        the arsenic. Rather those who are currently bearing the risks of arsenic 
        will wind up bearing the costs of removing the arsenic in the form of 
        higher taxes and/or higher water bills. This opposition to the standard 
        is consistent with EPA's finding that the benefits (which are the willingnesses 
        to pay for reduced arsenic by the affected people) are less than the costs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In conclusion:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">1. Economists would argue that if the benefits of the 10 
        ppb standard are clearly less than the costs, it is bad public policy 
        to force the standard on an unwilling population.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">2. However, the excess of cost over benefit is relatively 
        small; and there are enough uncertainties in the estimates of both benefits 
        and costs that the excess cost might be worth it in terms of purchasing 
        a safety margin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">3. Because of these uncertainties, benefit-cost analysis 
        can rarely provide an unambiguous answer about a difficult policy choice. 
        Therefore choices have to be made by politically responsible officials. 
        Given this, the 10 ppb standard is arguably a reasonable judgment in the 
        face of uncertainty. And it is a judgment arrived at by both a Democratic 
        and Republican administration.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">4. But there is another way to look at this issue. The cost 
        of meeting any standard for arsenic is high because all of the water going 
        through the system must be treated to remove the arsenic. However, only 
        a small percentage of this water is used in a way that poses any health 
        risk to people. Most of it goes down the toilet or shower drain, is sprinkled 
        on the lawn or is used to wash the car, etc. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The costs of protecting people from the risks of drinking 
        water containing arsenic would be much lower if water suppliers simply 
        gave their customers bottled water for drinking. The benefits of this 
        option would likely exceed the costs by a substantial margin. But this 
        alternative could not be considered by EPA because of specific language 
        in the Safe Drinking Water Act. Rethinking our approaches to improving 
        environmental health can show less costly and more beneficial ways of 
        promoting desirable environmental goals.<br>
