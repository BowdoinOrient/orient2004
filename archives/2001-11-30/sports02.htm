      <p>Tomorrow marks the first day of December, and we all know what that means. 
        It's time for one of Bowdoin's favorite (albeit chilly) pastimes: ice

      <p>The men hope to perform well in the 2001-2 winter season and are off 
        to a strong start, with three wins already under their belts. St. Anselm 
        (2-2), New England College (0-3), and Johnson and Wells (4-4) fell victim 
        to the Bear attack in the last two weeks. &quot;St. A's is a team that 
        I have a lot of respect for, and New England won its league championship 
        last year,&quot; head coach Terry Meagher said. &quot;To come out [strongly] 
        against them was a good feeling.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team also played an exhibition match with the under-18 national team 
        last week. Meagher said that the game was a chance to use the team's depth. 
        &quot;It was an opportunity for us to see what some people could do,&quot; 
        he stated.<br>
        In recent NESCAC standings, the Bears's 3-0 record was good for first 
        place and tied them with Colby, Middlebury, and Hamilton.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Upperclassmen returning to the Dayton ice dominate this season's roster. 
        According to Meagher, the large number of returning players affects the 
        team dynamic quite a bit. &quot;We went from a very young team last year 
        to a more mature, league-experienced team,&quot; he said. &quot;With that 
        goes a lot of intangibles-leadership, mentoring, ability to deal with 
        close games.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>A more experienced squad means a few other things as well. &quot;Promise, 
        at some point, must equal production,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;We have 
        high expectations for this group.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>On the offensive line, the experience of captain Mike Carosi '02, Sean 
        Starke '03, Andy McNerney '02, Bill Busch '02, and Adam Mantin '03, and 
        others leads the way. &quot;We feel that the line could be as prolific 
        as any line in the league,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;They're going to 
        have a lot of people paying attention to them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>After three games, Starke and Carosi are tied in the team's points category 
        with six apiece. Starke has scored four goals and two assists, and Carosi 
        has totaled one goal and five assists.<br>
      </p>
      <p>David Rush '02, Brian Shuman '02, Ryan Seymour '03, Jared Porter '03, 
        among several other upperclassmen, bring their defensive experience to 
        the fore this winter, and are predicted to make important contributions. 
        &quot;[The defense is] probably the strength of the team,&quot; Meagher 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This season's first-year class will see action as well. &quot;I have 
        confidence that we're going to have some solid people emerge from this 
        class,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;It's a wonderful set of young men who 
        play hard.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Sophomore Michael Healey steps into the shoes of graduated goaltender 
        Colin Robinson '01, and seems to be doing the job admirably thus far. 
        &quot;We have a lot of faith in Michael,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;Colin 
        played in big games; loved to take pucks and had a very strong desire 
        to be the best he could in that position. I think Mike has learned from 
        him; he's more assertive and wants to get it done.&quot;<br>
        Healey has allowed two goals in three games, a goals-against average that 
        Meagher called &quot;very good for the league.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Certain teams look as strong as ever in this year's league. &quot;It's 
        the usual suspects,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;Middlebury, Norwich, Colby, 
        Hamilton...&quot;<br>
        The Bears look to Skidmore (1-2) and Massachusetts College (1-4) next, 
        a schedule that may prove to make it a tough weekend. &quot;Skidmore beat 
        Williams last week,&quot; Meagher said. &quot;Mass College has a whole 
        new regime, so in a situation like that, you don't know what to expect. 
        They're going to be sharp and ready to play.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This weekend also carries the weight of a potential 300th career win 
        for Coach Meagher, who has notched 299 to date. He downplayed the distinction 
        when asked. &quot;I guess it's a sign of age,&quot; he joked.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's a time for reflection,&quot; he continued. &quot;As anybody 
        that is involved with education knows, it is a chance to work with young 
        people who have passion and drive. This is a very special place; people 
        put a lot of work into making our athletic programs strong, and I'm very 
        grateful.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Skidmore matchup starts tonight at 7:00 p.m., and Mass College visits 
        for an afternoon game tomorrow with a 4:00 start. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ditch all that last-week-of-classes anxiety and get over to Dayton this 
        weekend, GO U BEARS!<br>
