      <p align="left">After the events of September 11 and the subsequent path 
        of action embarked upon by the United States, many have expressed concern 
        about the safety of international travel. The concern hits particularly 
        close to home when one considers the 133 Bowdoin students who are abroad 
        this fall and the 151 will be next semester. Of those figures, 39 are 
        away for the entire 2001-2 academic year. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Off-Campus Study Advisor Janet Lynch, 135 juniors 
        had planned to study away in the spring, but as of Wednesday, that figure 
        was down to 118. She said that since spring plans are made almost a year 
        in advance, there is always a difference between the number of juniors 
        who plan to go and those who actually do. &quot;Plans do change,&quot; 
        she said. &quot;[It might be due to a] change in major, or students thinking 
        that staying at Bowdoin makes more sense for them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The uncertainty of international travel has not seemed to 
        deter Bowdoin students from heading out of the country. &quot;We haven't 
        seen major changes,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;We have seen a few people 
        drop out for the spring, and a few people changed from a year to just 
        the fall, but that isn't unusual.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Among those students that have changed their plans, the 
        terrorist attacks haven't been cited as key factors in the decision. &quot;I 
        wouldn't say that [the uncertainty] has a major or catastrophic effect 
        in any way,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;People are primarily concerned about 
        transportation; that's probably the number one thing on everyone's mind,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We've seen remarkably little in the way of changes,&quot; 
        said Director of Off-Campus Study Stephen Hall. &quot;We did have some 
        students dropping out in the couple of weeks after September 11.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Junior Alex Moore, who plans to attend the Intercollegiate 
        Center for Classical Studies in Rome next semester, said that he isn't 
        overly worried about his situation as an American overseas. &quot;I'm 
        bothered by it, obviously, but I feel that I'm going to be safe with my 
        program,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hall said that a number of students who decided not to go 
        abroad cited their parents' concerns about safety. &quot;It's usually 
        the parents and not the kids,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sophomore Chelsea Spector agreed. &quot;I think that parents 
        are a lot more concerned than kids,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Quite a few of those apprehensive parents have contacted 
        the Off-Campus Study office with questions since the attacks. &quot;We've 
        had a number of parents calling,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;Ultimately, it's 
        impossible to reassure everyone in light of recent events, but we've certainly 
        affirmed to parents that all of the programs have taken extra steps to 
        ensure the security of students.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We've both been fielding a lot of calls, particularly 
        in the month right after the 11th,&quot; Hall said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One junior ended up changing her plans after hearing her 
        parents' feelings on the subject. &quot;I was supposed to go Kenya for 
        the spring semester, and my parents decided that it just wasn't safe enough 
        after what had happened,&quot; Sydney Asbury said. &quot;I'm going to 
        Stockholm for the spring instead.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The off-campus study office has been in contact with Bowdoin 
        students in other countries several times since September and has encouraged 
        them to take common sense precautions-avoiding large and violent demonstrations 
        or places where one has heard that something might happen, or being in 
        a large group of Americans, according to Lynch. &quot;All of the programs 
        are taking extra measures to ensure the safety of the students,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The office also attempts to keep students who are living 
        in foreign countries aware of what is happening in the States. &quot;We 
        always forward the State Department bulletins to students, and that's 
        a help,&quot; Lynch said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lynch asserted that the main concern of study abroad programs 
        is airline security but also said that traveling to another country isn't 
        necessarily worse than flying home for the holidays. &quot;You've got 
        just as much of a chance [on a domestic flight],&quot; she said. &quot;You're 
        probably safer when flying in Europe, actually.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Spector indicated that she didn't have any major qualms 
        about flying either. &quot;It's still the safest form of travel,&quot; 
        she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Class of 2004's interest in studying away hasn't seemed 
        to drop off since the attacks. &quot;There seems to be plenty of optimism 
        and enthusiasm among the sophomore class,&quot; Lynch said. &quot;I haven't 
        seen any major changes.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hall said that America's political and military circumstances 
        haven't come up often in his discussions with sophomores, and that the 
        number of interested students is very similar to last year's figure. &quot;We're 
        just a bit smaller on the books for next year,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'm not really nervous, because security is so high 
        right now,&quot; sophomore Brittany Blanchette said. &quot;I still want 
        to study away, because experiencing another country is a such wonderful 
        opportunity that I may not have again.&quot;</p>
