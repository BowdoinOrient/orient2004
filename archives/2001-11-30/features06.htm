        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR <br>
        </font></p>
      <p align="left">From Bowdoin College in the last few years before the Civil 
        War, Thomas Worchester Hyde of the Class of 1861 wrote, &quot;There is 
        scarcely anything to write from this stupid place!&quot; Perhaps that's 
        why Hyde decided to join the University of Chicago in 1860 as a member 
        of its first graduating class. By the latter half of that year, as storm 
        clouds were threatening to break apart the nation that the Founding Fathers 
        had forged, &quot;many signs and omens of a coming dissolution of the 
        Union were visible,&quot; Hyde remembered, &quot;but boys of eighteen 
        and nineteen were not much impressed by them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde, however, was paying close attention to what was going 
        on. He remembered that there was talk of nominating a fellow Bowdoin man, 
        Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden, for the presidency.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This was an idea that the good senator, from the Class of 
        1823, quickly shrugged off. To a friend the Portland resident wrote that, 
        &quot;no one can do me so much injury in any way as by mentioning my name.&quot; 
        Indeed, Fessenden was a well-known name in the Senate by that time. For 
        years he had fought against Southern sympathizers and had lived up to 
        the ideals of the newly formed Republican Party. The fact that Fessenden 
        did not want the job was, however, understandable. He was in constant 
        poor health and he was also getting along in his years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Pitt Fessenden rested in Maine and tried to regain his 
        health for the fight that was surely to come, should the Republicans prevail, 
        Thomas Hyde was clerking for Abraham Lincoln in Illinois. He remembered 
        living in the Scammon house which Lincoln frequented during the campaign. 
        Consequently this was also the same home where Lincoln would first meet 
        his Vice-President to be, Maine Senator Hannibal Hamlin. Hyde's job was 
        to help open letters for Lincoln. He recalls, &quot;Many packages would 
        come with letters, some containing negro doll babies, some dead rattlesnakes, 
        and various tokens of that description from Southerners. Whenever a box 
        looked particularly suspicious, we used to soak it in water, fearing some 
        infernal machine.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Invited to join Lincoln's escort to Washington DC after 
        his election in November 1860 Hyde declined and instead joined the Chicago 
        Zouaves as a private. He saw no action but his experience with this early 
        regiment would serve him well in the future. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Washington D.C., there was hell to pay. As promised by 
        the Southern states, the parade of secessionists began within a few weeks 
        of Lincoln's victory. Pitt Fessenden watched his Southern colleagues go 
        without objection. </p>
      <p align="left">He was opposed to any compromise with the slave states, 
        writing:<br>
        <i>My opinion is that much of the noise is got up for effect in the hope 
        that the North will be frightened and the Republicans induced to falter 
        and thus lose the confidence of the people in their firmness and capacity. 
        Of this there is little danger. I, for one, am resolved to stand just 
        where I am, come what may. As to peaceable secession, there is no such 
        thing, and if war comes, it remains to be seen if we have a government 
        and where the strength lies&#133;. Ruin is staring them in the face. Whatever 
        may happen to the people of the free States, there is nothing before the 
        South but destruction&#133;We shall not yield. It is a question which 
        has but one side, for the cause of Freedom is sacred. We cannot sacrifice 
        it to menace and clamor and would not if we could&#133;We are made of 
        sterner stuff than the old Whigs and will not yield an inch under menace, 
        come what will. I am not sure but that the trouble thus brought upon the 
        country may paralyze us, but we consider this as the final struggle to 
        reestablish correct principles of government, and we shall stand by our 
        platform, disunion or no disunion, to the bitter end&#133;I will not yield 
        an iota of our principles to avoid this catastrophe, for it is a question 
        for all time. New England by herself has all the elements of happiness 
        and power, and I would rather belong to a small and free State than be 
        subject to an oligarchy so overbearing and tyrannical as the slave power. 
        I will watch, therefore, the course of events, averting all the evil I 
        can, but resolved not to do evil in order to avert suffering.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden was ready for a fight. And it was a good thing 
        that he was, for soon enough the firing on Fort Sumter inaugurated the 
        Civil War. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Illinois, Thomas Hyde voiced his opinion that the rebellion 
        would take more than the seventy-five thousand men, the amount Lincoln 
        had called for, to put down. He was ignored. Soon, however, Hyde journeyed 
        home to Maine where his friends were all joining the army. Hyde remembered 
        returning to Bowdoin to teach the Zouave maneuvers he had picked up in 
        Chicago. He &quot;directed as skirmishers many future generals and colonels 
        down Main Street to capture the Topsham bridge.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Depressed that he would be too late to join in the action 
        before the War was won, Hyde eagerly digested the news of the Union defeat 
        at Bull Run. The War would go on. Along with William Pitt Fessenden's 
        son, Sam, Thomas Worchester Hyde volunteered his services to the Union 
        cause.<br>
