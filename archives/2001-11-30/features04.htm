      <p align="left">The last talk of the lecture series &quot;Works in Progress&quot; 
        was delivered by Nancy Jennings, Associate Professor of Education Department, 
        on Thursday, November 22nd, in the African American Center. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Her inspiring lecture, entitled <i>Remaining Or Becoming 
        : A Dilemma In Rurual Education</i> focused on her experiences as a rural 
        education specialist, her concerns about curriculum reforms in rural education, 
        and the tensions of remaining and becoming that happen to most rural students. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite growing up in an urban area of Chicago, Jennings 
        takes much interest in the educational prospects of the rural community. 
        Before coming to Maine, she took part in a multi-year, multi-state education 
        project to research how state and national institutions decide educational 
        standards for institutions of local levels. The diverse experiences gained 
        from traveling around the country, living in different communities and 
        observing various education approaches have helped her togain much insight 
        into the complexity of rural education.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These fascinating experiences inspired her to continue studying 
        the prospects of rural education in Maine several years ago. Her study, 
        concentrating on the rural districts in northern Maine, explored the effects 
        of the Maine education standards put in place to the teachers of the Main 
        rural schools at the time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jennings states that there is an established tension between 
        the ideals of rural and urban educators in constructing the curriculum. 
        Rural educators usually endorse hands-on curriculum, which teach students 
        practical skills that are applicable in their community, meanwhile enriching 
        their appreciation for the place they come from. In contrast, the rural 
        school advocates emphasize on an &quot; urban, homogeneous&quot; curriculum 
        which adhere to state standards but are oftentimes unsuited to the rural 
        culture. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She pointed out, however, that the conflict between the 
        two ideals has been simplistic and questioned whether the tension exists 
        under realistic terms, pointing to examples of schools who succeeded in 
        meeting both the national and local standards that she witnessed in St. 
        John Valley and Fox Island, Northern Maine.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With regards to students, Jennings also expressed her concern 
        about the dilemma facing rural high school students between remaining 
        in their community and therein sustaining the community and leaving to 
        a new better community after receiving a sound education. The tension 
        occurs in both institutions and individuals. It raises a pressing question 
        to rural educators as to which direction they should direct their students. 
        They are also concerned about how to construct a locally responsive curriculum 
        that meets state standards.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to her, a lot of rural students reject their opportunities 
        of getting a better education in a place other than their home either 
        because they are afraid of being in an alien place, or because the obligation 
        of staying home blocks their vision of their own choices. The reaction 
        is similar in students from poor rural neighborhoods and students of color. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Therefore, the important task of educators, is to make these 
        students realize the options that are available to them, as well as to 
        create an educational environment that &quot;makes the world less scary 
        out of where they come from.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an open discussion after the talk, many students, staff, 
        and faculty members stated their opinions about the dilemma of rural and 
        minority students and how it plays out in the Bowdoin community. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Works in progress&quot; is a lecture series organized 
        by three Bowdoin students: Riquelmy Sosa '05, Min Kim '05, and Derrick 
        Duplessy '02. It was created with the goal of creating a new kind of in-depth 
        discourse on different topics in an informal setting for all members of 
        the Bowdoin community who are interested. This series will be continued 
        next semester.</p>
