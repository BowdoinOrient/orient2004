        <font size="2">ERIC CHAMBERS<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">At its spring 2001 meeting, the College Board of Trustees 
        chose six new members to serve for five-year terms. It also named various 
        trustees to administrative positions on the Board and granted emeritus 
        status to six retiring Trustees.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The six new members are Michael S. Cary '71, Michael M. 
        Crow, Stephen F. Gormley '72, Alvin D. Hall '74, Lisa A. McElaney '77, 
        and Sheldon M. Stone '74. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Cary is headmaster and trustee of Lawrenceville School in 
        Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He holds both an MA in teaching from Brown 
        University and an MA in religious studies from Yale University. In 1994, 
        he won the Bowdoin Distinguished Education Award. He also served as president 
        of the Bowdoin Alumni Council.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Crow is the executive vice provost and professor of science 
        policy at Columbia University, as well as an author. He is an alumnus 
        of Iowa State University and earned his Ph.D. in public administration 
        from Syracuse University. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After majoring in government at Bowdoin, Gormley earned 
        his MBA at Columbia University. As well as serving as chairman of the 
        board of Duro Communications and General Systems Solutions, he is the 
        co-founder and current managing partner of Great Hill Partners, which 
        provides equity financing and guidance to media and communications businesses. 
        He also served on the Bowdoin Special Gifts committee.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Currently president of Alvin D. Hall Associates, Alvin Hall 
        is responsible for creating and implementing marketing campaigns and investment-training 
        seminars. He earned his MA in American Literature from the University 
        of North Carolina. In addition to being a prolific author on financial-planning 
        strategies, he hosts his own television show on BBC Television, Investing 
        for All with Alan Hall.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">McElaney earned her MFA degree at Columbia University. She 
        now works as both a teacher and a filmmaker, producing videos about family 
        health issues-her work has earned her many awards. She is also the president 
        and executive producer of Vida Health in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Stone is currently a principal at Oaktree Capital Management 
        in Los Angeles, providing investment strategies to businesses. He majored 
        in government at Bowdoin, and earned his MBA from Columbia University. 
        He has served as a BASIC representative, as well as a member of the Class 
        of 1974 25th Reunion Special Gifts Committee.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the spring meeting, the Board of Trustees also re-elected 
        D. Ellen Shuman '76 as a vice-chair. In addition, it named as Anne W. 
        Springer '81 as Secretary of the Board and David R. Treadwell Jr. '64 
        as assistant secretary of the Board.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Board also granted six retiring members emeritus status. 
        Although emeritus members no longer vote at Trustee meetings, they are 
        still very active in Trustee affairs. The six retiring members are Walter 
        E. Bartlett '53, Thomas Clark Casey '51, William Harris Hazen '52, Robert 
        H. Millar '62, Carolyn Walch Slayman H'85, and Leslie Walker '85. Millar 
        was also elected Secretary of the Trustees Emeritus. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Currently, there are forty-nine trustees on the Board, including 
        President of the College Barry Mills. Working in various committees, the 
        Board of Trustees is responsible for acting as the chief policy-making 
        body for the College. These policies include governance, financial management 
        (including budget approvals and ground maintenance), financial development, 
        presidential selection and assessment, communication among both college 
        and community members, academic affairs, and student life. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Choosing trustees is a cumulative process,&quot; said 
        Secretary of the College Richard Mersereau. &quot;Names are not picked 
        from a hat. They may be picked from any source, but more often they are 
        chosen through relations with former alums and parents.&quot; The names 
        usually &quot;come about because people like myself, the President, Bill 
        Torrey [Vice-President for Planning and Development], and others are always 
        on the lookout.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Once names are collected, the Trustees' Affairs Commission, 
        which is responsible for the control of administrative affairs of trustee 
        members, selects electees. The Commission aims to create a sense of &quot;balance 
        in as many ways as possible,&quot; according to Mersereau by choosing 
        electees among a wide variety of professions and backgrounds. Mersereau 
        added, &quot;We do this to ensure excellence across the boards and excellence 
        divided as many ways as possible,&quot; said Mersereau.<br>
