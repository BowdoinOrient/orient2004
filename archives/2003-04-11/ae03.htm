      <p align="left">The disease? Musical snobbery, and the virus is spreading. 
        What used to be a title only given to the most astute indie rocker is 
        now finding more and more victims as the general population's taste in 
        music worsens. Where an art rocker dressed in black used to be easily 
        identifiable, the music snob now comes in all forms of appearance and 
        musical taste. The music snob must be defined as one with an intense love 
        for a certain flavor of music, often to the point of borderline obsession. 
        And it isn't always a question of appreciating music, because equally 
        important to the music snob's identity is an intense repulsion for any 
        genre of music that he or she sees as a scar to musical ingenuity.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Obscurity. This is perhaps the most obvious clue. If a conversation about 
        music with someone turns into a frantic listing of bands until one of 
        you has not heard of the named group, you very well could be at risk of 
        being a music snob.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Classics. You must have a working knowledge of classic albums and early 
        influences. But, because you are a music snob, this trait must surpass 
        the big titles by any band. In other words, familiarity with Sgt. Pepper 
        won't get you too far. Claiming you know a lot about the history of rock 
        and then not being able to support is a sure fire way to lose all respect 
        when in the company of fellow snobs. Don't be surprised if you are ostracized 
        or the object of extreme ridicule from there on out. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bragging. What makes a music snob separate from one who enjoys good music 
        is often revealed in this step. A music snob goes out of his or her way 
        to make everything they know about music accessible to whomever is in 
        earshot. While one who simply enjoys good music can contribute to a musical 
        discussion, the music snob feels it necessary to reveal everything they 
        know about the topic. This includes battles with other music snobs, and 
        an addiction to showing off your musical trivia knowledge (guest performers, 
        set lists, etc.) at every chance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Guilty Pleasures. Image is important to a music snob, so he or she must 
        not admit to liking artists that don't fit into his or her category of 
        acceptable music. Therefore, his or her intense attraction to the music 
        of Hanson must not be acted upon. This can result in musical denial and 
        closet listening, revealed when a close friend finds a very worn album 
        hidden within the trenches of the music snob's sock drawer.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Friends. The music snob often refuses to associate with people that are 
        more knowledgeable in the history of rock. If music snob A's area of specialty 
        is underground hip-hop, he or she would most likely be better friends 
        with music snob B, who enjoys indie rock in the post-punk variety, than 
        say with music snob C, who also likes underground hip-hop. Whether A or 
        C knows more is not important. The plain fact is that A and C's relationship 
        would never be able to bloom, because they would constantly be competing 
        for the underground hip-hop championship belt.</p>
      <p align="left">
        CD Collection. If you have ever gone to the living space of a new acquaintance, 
        seen their CD collection, and ran away horrified and scarred for life, 
        there's a very good chance that you are a music snob (unless they had 
        a wide selection of Creed, then your bolting is completely admissible). 
        However, chances are you would not be in that situation, because you would 
        have already spoken with your new friend about their musical tastes prior 
        to entering their home. If you didn't discuss their musical tastes before 
        entering their home, you might want to question your music snob status. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Possession. One of the most tell tale signs of a music snob is possession 
        of a certain band or album. Music snob A and music snob B may both love 
        band C. If this is the case and this realization does not allow the two 
        snobs to bond, chances are there will be a messy blurting out of facts 
        and other completely unrelated musical trivia, which will probably make 
        the two snobs appear pathetic and obsessed rather than musical appreciators.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Godliness. The inability to understand that others have a love affair 
        with music as intense as yours is both obnoxious and the most potent music 
        snob trait. The snob uses music to separate him/herself from others instead 
        of using it as a bridge to meet more musically astute and intelligent 
        people, and that's just sad. And scary. And pathetic.</p>
      <p align="left">
        What you can do to un-snobbify yourself: accept the fact it is okay to 
        like some uncultured music; be kind to people with no taste (just don't 
        discuss your newest album purchases with them); express your opinion but 
        realize that an opinion, is all that it is. Just remember, it's good to 
        love your music; it's bad to think you're a god. No one likes a music 
        snob, not even other music snobs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        So the inevitable question is: does it matter what type of music you are 
        snobby about? </p>
      <p align="left">
        While obscure bands used to be an integral element in finding a music 
        snob, with the world's growing interest in pop, can a music snob now encompass 
        those who refuse to listen to anything but the Billboard Top Ten? </p>
      <p align="left">
        I suppose I could say that anyone who relies on contemporary American 
        pop and dislikes anything that isn't played by Clear Channel is an idiot, 
        but then that would align me with the music snob. Musical snobbery is 
        only the result of an opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own&#133; 
        just don't expect me to listen to yours.</p>
