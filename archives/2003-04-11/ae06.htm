      <p align="left">If you are a fan of rock 'n roll, there are two events this 
        weekend that you should be sure to attend. The Bowdoin Film Society is 
        bringing punk rock to two of the biggest screens on campus. On Friday, 
        April 11, Rock 'n Roll High School (1979), starring the Ramones and produced 
        by Roger Corman, will play in Kresge Auditorium (a switch from our usual 
        venue). For Saturday, April 12, we move back to Smith Auditorium with 
        Blank Generation (1979), starring Richard Hell. Both films will begin 
        at 7:00 p.m., but come a little earlier to hear some music.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If you are unfamiliar with the music of Richard Hell or the Ramones, these 
        films are excellent introductions. Both contain live performance footage 
        of the bands. In the case of Blank Generation, this is the only hi-fi 
        visual footage of Richard Hell playing with the band that recorded the 
        Blank Generation LP (a bonus for Ramones fans: the drummer for the Voidoids 
        was Marc Bell, later to become Marky Ramone). While the inclusion of live 
        performances is perhaps the most compelling reason to see these films, 
        each one has much more to offer besides a great soundtrack.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Rock 'n Roll High School is one of my favorite bad movies of all time. 
        When I say bad, I mean it has a low budget, cheesy script, second rate 
        acting, and yet an incredible potential for entertainment. Considering 
        the Ramones' almost cartoonish image, this film is the perfect vehicle 
        for their music. The whole thing is a tongue-in-cheek rendition of the 
        typical teen movie. The setting, Vince Lombardi High, is populated by 
        jocks and rocker chicks, nerds and cheerleaders. Yet all of them seem 
        to be united in their love of rock 'n roll.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In this story of students vs. a fascist school administration, Riff Randall 
        (P.J. Soles) is a troublemaker, and the Ramones' number one fan. With 
        the help of the nerdy Kate Rambeau (who, of course, is beautiful once 
        you get her glasses off), Riff concocts a plan to make it to the Ramones' 
        concert and free her school from the iron fisted grip of the new principal. 
        Though the Ramones concert converts Mr. McCree, the school's music teacher, 
        to the cause of rock music (&quot;I regret that I have but one life to 
        give for rock 'n roll!&quot;), it is the Ramones, themselves, who must 
        be called in to save the day and, quite literally, rock down the school.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Ramones are not actors. They do not pretend to be actors. The delivery 
        of their lines ranges from manic over-enthusiasm to what appears to be 
        total ignorance that they are in a movie at all. That might be why they 
        are given few opportunities to speak and most of their screen time is 
        dedicated to musical performance. This is for the best as the punk rock 
        component is what raises Rock 'n Roll High School far above other teen 
        comedies.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In contrast, Blank Generation is a drama that takes place in the midst 
        of the 1970s New York punk scene. Richard Hell (of Television, the Heartbreakers, 
        and the Voidoids) stars as Billy, whose rise to success as a rock star 
        is contrasted with his stormy relationship with Nada, a beautiful French 
        journalist played by Carole Bouquet (the Bond girl in For Your Eyes Only). 
        Andy Warhol also appears in a small role.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I was able to contact Richard Hell and ask him some questions about the 
        making of Blank Generation. Hell replied by saying that he had hoped to 
        make a film reflecting the thoughts and experiences of his years as a 
        performer in New York City. Due in part to a lack of rapport with the 
        director, Ulli Lommel, the film became less about what Hell wanted and 
        more about the impressions that Lommel had of Hell, and his own interpretation 
        of Hell's &quot;blank generation.&quot; Of the resulting movie, Hell states 
        that he thinks it is &quot;empty and pretentious and boring.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While Hell's dismal assessment of Blank Generation is valid as far as 
        the story goes, I believe there are a great number of redeeming features 
        that make the film worth watching, for example, Richard Hell himself. 
        Hell appears much as he did in real life. With the exception of one or 
        two items reserved for use in the film, his wardrobe consists of clothes 
        that he owned at the time. Those of you familiar with punk's history may 
        recall that Malcolm McLaren, the eventual manager of the Sex Pistols, 
        used Hell's image as an inspiration for the band he was to create. In 
        fact, modern punk rockers in such far-flung places as Cork, Ireland still 
        flaunt the ripped, do-it-yourself type of clothing that Hell brought to 
        the New York music scene. Richard Hell and many other people appearing 
        in Blank Generation provide us with a visual record of how early New York 
        punk culture looked.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Visual elements are some of the most interesting components of Blank Generation. 
        Ed Lachman, who received an Oscar nomination this year for his work on 
        Far From Heaven, was responsible for the film's cinematography. Lachman 
        worked with the landscape of New York's Lower East Side to create images 
        that are visually stunning. The film also treats us to a casual tour through 
        CBGB's, the home base of many early punk and proto-punk bands. The camera 
        takes us throughout the legendary club, moving from the main room, to 
        backstage, to the green room, and back. When a gig is being played, we 
        are given a perfect view of the stage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The musical performances captured in Blank Generation are the one aspect 
        of the film that Richard Hell identifies as worthwhile. Among the songs 
        performed are &quot;Love Comes in Spurts&quot; and the classic &quot;Blank 
        Generation.&quot; According to Hell, the appearance of these performances 
        is typical of Voidoids gigs. He notes: &quot;We were just playing the 
        material we'd been playing for a year on that stage and even the audience 
        is familiar. I recognize a lot of them.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The author wishes to thank Richard Hell for answering her questions about 
        Blank Generation. If you would like to read more about Rock 'n Roll High 
        School, track down a copy of the WBOR 'zine and read the article entitled
