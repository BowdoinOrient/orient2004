      <p align="left"> There is a specter of confusion haunting campus&#133; You'd 
        think at a school like Bowdoin we would be pretty smart, would have done 
        fairly well on our SAT verbals, and could perhaps use simple words correctly. 
        But no, in fact, there seems to be quite a bit of ambiguity around the 
        usage of &quot;like&quot; and &quot;love.&quot; Yes, yes, I know they 
        are four-letter words, but then again, so is &quot;beer&quot; so clearly 
        the character-count is not the issue. Rather, I think misuse and overuse 
        have so tainted these two words in our minds that at this point we have 
        no idea what anyone is saying, let alone ourselves. So this week I examine 
        THE WAY WE USE &quot;LIKE&quot; AND &quot;LOVE&quot; and what exactly 
        these words actually mean.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Let's start off slowly: &quot;like.&quot; I like having fun. I like this 
        professor. I like Zoolander. All correct usages of the word. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Aidan says, &quot;I really like this freshman girl.&quot; This may be 
        proper grammar, but if you know Aidan like I do, you would realize that 
        this is incorrect. Because &quot;like&quot; can mean that you enjoy something, 
        that is pleases you, or makes you happy. Aidan could be saying that he 
        thinks this girl is nice and wants to be her purely platonic friend. However 
        &quot;like&quot; can also be used to signify physical or mental attraction, 
        some small step in the general direction of love (more on that later). 
        And therein lies the problem.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The girl Aidan likes? He's spoken maybe 15 words to her, total. He thinks 
        she's hot, he hasn't heard that she has a boyfriend, or that she's a raging 
        slut, so he says without any reserve, &quot;Dude, I'm so pissed that she 
        thinks Dave is good-looking. I really like her.&quot; News flash: Aidan 
        does not like this girl. He can like what she looks like, he can like 
        her reputation, but he doesn't know her! How can he say he likes her? 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        For the record, you cannot like a person without knowing them. You can 
        probably have a little crush on them from afar, but that is not to be 
        confused with actually liking someone.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The way Carrie sees it, &quot;There are three, maybe four people I could 
        actually say I like right now. I mean there are probably a hundred that 
        I think are nice, funny, cute, sexy, or some combination of those qualities. 
        I don't necessarily like like the people I hook up with even. But when 
        I say that I like a person in a non-friendship sense, I mean that I am 
        attracted to him, that we get along and that I would like to go out with 
        him.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Which leads me to the next point. You would like someone either by getting 
        to know him or her or upon going out with them. You would probably like 
        them for a while as you dated and got to know them even better. You would 
        begin to learn their deep, dark secrets, let down your guard around them 
        and trust them. You would realize that there is no one else in the world 
        at that moment who you would rather be with-physically and psychologically. 
        You would be at your happiest when you were with them or even at the mere 
        thought of them. You would want to do anything for them and vice versa. 
        You would want to be with them as much as possible; you would know they 
        felt the same way too. This is more or less &quot;love.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Of course, as with the word &quot;like,&quot; &quot;love&quot; can be 
        used in many ways. I love my family. I love some of my friends. I love 
        not having class on Fridays. &quot;Love&quot; can be used conventionally, 
        without confusion, to signify liking something so much that it must be 
        described on another level. Similarly, when you like a person romantically 
        enough that you can no longer describe it with the word &quot;like&quot;, 
        &quot;love&quot; is acceptable. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Love is when you feel something that you can't describe. The word 
        doesn't even begin to cover what you feel, it's just the only thing that 
        gives any sort of indication,&quot; Audrey tries to explain.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many people sign letters or emails &quot;love&quot; or say &quot;I love 
        you&quot; when getting off the phone with someone who is not their boyfriend 
        or girlfriend. This is good and normal when it is to someone who will 
        understand how you are using it-when it's a family member or a friend 
        with whom there is clearly (and when I say &quot;clearly&quot; I mean 
        no doubt in either of your minds) no way to be misread. This is such a 
        touchy subject that I would go so far as to say that when signing something 
        &quot;love&quot; to someone who is not related to you, it might be best 
        to stick with heterosexual friends of the same sex, homosexual friends 
        of the opposite sex or someone you love the way you would love a relative 
        and you know they feel the same way. That's not a rule, just a basic guideline. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Stewart gets freaked out every time Melissa, a girl he knows from home, 
        signs her emails &quot;love.&quot; &quot;We don't really know each other 
        that well and aren't even good friends. If it were just a close friend 
        who was a girl, I wouldn't be uncomfortable, but I have the feeling she's 
        testing me out or something. Then I feel pressured to respond with &quot;love&quot; 
        which is certainly not the way I feel in any way and it just turns me 
        off from her overall.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Poor Stew. Poor Melissa, for that matter. Maybe she just signs all her 
        emails &quot;love&quot; and it doesn't mean anything. Maybe she does &quot;like&quot; 
        him &quot;that way&quot; and is trying to get him to return the sentiment. 
        These problems could be avoided if everyone understood what the appropriate 
        uses of these words were. If only they'd read an article such as this 
        one&#133;</p>
