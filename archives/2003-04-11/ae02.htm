      <p align="left"> I have never swallowed anything more unbelievable than 
        the show put on by the Regurgitator. Like Hamlet looking at the wasted 
        face of his childhood jester, my temperature rose. And yet, despite the 
        generally unsettling nature of the Regurgitator's act, I could not help 
        but gape open-mouthed and open-eyed at the spectacle unfolding on stage.</p>
      <p align="left">
        He stepped up on stage with light feet, a quick tongue, a sparkling jacket, 
        a Scottish accent, and a stomach like no other. To the list of great entertainers-Houdini, 
        Charlie Chaplin, Fred Astaire, etc.-here, surely, is a man who must be 
        added. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Stevie Starr, otherwise known as the Regurgitator, has nobly pursued fame 
        by swallowing a variety of objects and substances and then bringing them 
        back up. From billiard balls to smoke to live fish, Starr seemed able 
        to stomach anything and everything.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Stevie Starr spent the first eighteen years of his life in a children's 
        home in Glasgow and it was there that he discovered his unique talent. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I think I was about four when I started swallowing my pocket money,&quot; 
        says Starr, &quot;and then I tried other things like going out into the 
        garden and swallowing a bumble bee and then bringing him back and letting 
        him fly away.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Not only does he swallow things, he swallows them in a manner that suggests, 
        dare I say, genius. I hear your protest: &quot;How can you apply that 
        word to someone who vomits for entertainment?&quot; I would counter with 
        the following: he is not the average entertainer. Not only did his act 
        explore the boundaries of his own extraordinary talent, it also explored 
        the boundaries of the imagination of an entire audience. </p>
      <p align="left">
        During the second part of his performance, he promised the audience that 
        he would hypnotize a girl chosen at random from the audience and then 
        make her swallow a live goldfish. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While continuing with several other tricks-swallowing locks and rings 
        and various things-he made sure to comment on the fact that the girl would 
        soon come join him in a dinner of live fish. Although most assumed that 
        he was joking, his squeals of delight at the prospect of feeding the girl 
        the live fish bordered on believable. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Venturing into a realm beyond the stage and his abilities, Starr was able 
        to add a whole other dimension to his performance. Would the girl actually 
        swallow a live fish? Were his extraordinary abilities somehow transmittable? 
        Like a deity bestowing some kind of blessing on a loyal supplicant, would 
        Starr be able to make the girl swallow the fish? </p>
      <p align="left">
        As the girl was brought up on stage, it seemed from the look in her eyes 
        that one part of her was asking these very questions. Starr smiled as 
        though he had swallowed the very devil. &quot;Do you want to swallow a 
        fish?&quot; asked Starr, leering at the girl. &quot;Yes,&quot; she answered 
        slowly. He then proceeded to put a fish in his own mouth and approached 
        the girl, telling her to open wide. </p>
      <p align="left">
        At the last moment, convinced that he was indeed making good on the fantastic 
        promise, she started back and said, in startled tones, &quot;No!&quot; 
        Of course, he admitted that he had never planned to make her swallow the 
        live fish. However, that was beside the point because Starr had been able 
        to convince at least part of the audience members that the impossible 
        was possible. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Starr has appeared on a variety of television shows including Tonight 
        with Jay Leno, Late Night with Dave Letterman, and The Arsenio Hall Show. 
        He performed for Bowdoin College on Friday night in Smith Union, and all 
        were humbled by his presence-and the skills of his most talented digestive 
        system.</p>
