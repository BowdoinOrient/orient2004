      <p align="left">The Bears extended their winning streak to three games as 
        they put down NESCAC rival Colby College 6-2 last Friday afternoon. First 
        year Trevor Powers went the distance, throwing his second complete game 
        of the season. He allowed only seven hits and one earned run in the winning 
        effort.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Colby managed to get to Powers early with some clutch hitting. In the 
        top of the third, Colby led the Bears 2-0. As has been the trend throughout 
        the year, Bowdoin's bats were smoking like senior Dennis Kiley's apartment 
        last spring. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the next inning, first baseman Tommy McMahon '05 stepped to the plate 
        after a pair of singles and a walk. The first baseman came through with 
        a single that scored two runs and tied the ballgame. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As Powers continued to cool off Colby's early offensive charge, the Bears 
        broke out in the seventh inning. With the help of some slap singles and 
        some above average heckling by Bowdoin fans, the Bears put up four runs 
        in the bottom of the seventh. An RBI-double from Jimmy &quot;Shady&quot; 
        Shea '05 was followed up by a two-run single by John Clifford '04 that 
        put the Bears up by four at the end of the inning. Offensively, Emmanuel 
        Pajaro was, again, all chirp, no twerk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears finished the game with a smooth 6-4-3 double play. Since the 
        beginning of the season, the team has tightened up defensively. Early 
        season losses in Florida and against Trinity were characterized by sloppy 
        defense. Due to recent success, it seems as if the Polar Bears have remedied 
        that early season malady. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the game against University of Southern Maine last Wednesday 
        was another story. In an offensive smoke show, the Bears were outscored 
        by the Huskies of USM 12-10. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears flew out of the gates, scoring four runs in the first inning. 
        By the fifth, the score was tied at nine. However, in the bottom of that 
        inning, USM put up three runs and sealed the victory.</p>
      <p align="left">
        For the Bears, Manny Lora '04 had three hits and four RBIs to break out 
        of his offensive drought of late. As a team, the Bears put up 14 hits 
        against the Husky squad. Eight of these hits came from John Clifford '04 
        and Tom McMahon '05-each finishing the game with four hits apiece. </p>
      <p align="left">
        McMahon and Jared Lemieux '06 each homered in the losing effort. Lemieux's 
        shot was fairly clutch, as it tied up the ball game in the fifth. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As has been the continual inclination of the squad, the problems for the 
        Bears were clearly not at the plate. All nine everyday starters are hitting 
        over .300. Shady Shea and Ricky Leclerc '06 are actually hitting in the 
        mid-.400s. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Impressively, Tom McMahon has posted 24 RBIs in only 17 games. Although 
        it is quite obvious at this point, hitting is not the reason that the 
        Bears currently carry a losing record. Just to add something interesting 
        here-Steve &quot;Squishy&quot; Curwen '06 has a 2.000 slugging percentage. 
        Needless to say, he is the envy of baseball players and fantasy owners 
        worldwide. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bears go into this weekend facing the number one team in the NESCAC, 
        Tufts University. Tufts boasts an 11-4 overall record and is 3-0 in the 
        divisional games. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking toward the upcoming weekend, second baseman Kevin Bougie '04 said, 
        &quot;This is always the biggest weekend for us as a team. It has the 
        ability to set the tone for the remainder of the season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bougie continued, &quot;We lost a tough one against USM, but, as we have 
        done before, we will bounce back. I would never question the resilience 
        of this team. We just have to play like we know we can.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        If the infamous Brooklyn Bomber can keep his bat hot, I am sure you guys 
        will be fine.</p>
