      <p> Critics. A lovely bunch. Falling on various points on the line that 
        divides film as art and film as entertainment, they usually have things 
        pretty well figured out-offering a fair and balanced critique of the gems 
        and the junk that grace our screen. But sometimes, quite frankly, they 
        scare me.</p>
      <p align="left"> <i>Phone Booth</i>, Joel Schumacher's latest thriller, 
        has gotten nothing but jeers in most major reviews. It's too &quot;corny,&quot; 
        &quot;flaky,&quot; &quot;contrived,&quot; &quot;stuck up,&quot; blah-di-blah-di-blah. 
        Having learned to trust their general gist, I took my seat tentatively 
        at the theater last weekend, ready for another spring dud. But once the 
        credits rolled, I found myself wondering if these guys just tried their 
        damnedest not to have fun. I searched for evidence and for a second it 
        made eerie sense. Look at Roger Ebert-does he look like an outgoing kind 
        of guy? No, not so much.</p>
      <p align="left">
        About ten minutes into the film, I realized my own picky wanna-be critic 
        voices did not need to be silenced for me to enjoy myself; they were happy, 
        cheery voices, waving their pom-poms around and doing somersaults in my 
        head. This was an immensely enjoyable film, something actually worth rooting 
        for.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Irish superstar Colin Farrell plays Stu Shepard, a New York City publicist 
        with a talent in cleverness and trickery and a lifetime consumer of money 
        morals and designer Italian suits. He is introduced to us as a well-honed 
        player in media circles, a hip joker with images to sell, the most important 
        being his own. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As he does every day, he calls his girlfriend Pam (Katie Holmes) from 
        the phone booth on 52nd Street. But today is utterly different. The phone 
        in the booth rings, Stu picks up, and things start getting interesting. 
        For the rest of the film, Stu is taunted and tortured by the sniper on 
        the other line, watching him from any of hundreds of windows overhead, 
        with any of a hundred motives. </p>
      <p align="left"> It's not easy to keep a one-location film interesting for 
        more than an hour, but <i>Phone Booth</i> managed to do just that. Although 
        Stu never left the area around the phone booth, the scene around him was 
        always in constant flux and movement. First, a relatively innocent New 
        York street. Next, a crowd gathers. Soon, the cops arrive. Then Stu can 
        see himself on the TVs across the street. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kudos to the cinematography as well. Without any explosions, car chases, 
        or high-tech gun battles-even with the good guy and the bad guy standing 
        completely still most of the time-this film can still be called an action 
        movie. This is all thanks to the frenzied camerawork, which seemed to 
        do all the running around for them. Schizophrenic, spasmodic, and sometimes 
        having what you could call a split personality, the camera was far more 
        insane than the sniper, whose methods paled in comparison. 52nd Street 
        became a shooting range through its eyes, a battlefield, target practice. 
        I didn't always know if I was seeing through Stu's eyes, the sniper's, 
        or some third party; but always, I felt like I too was aiming at something.</p>
      <p align="left"> All money-grubbing moviemaking and impressive action techniques 
        aside, the critics were very much right on at least one point: the acting 
        was pretty terrible. Colin Farrell, who suddenly erupted on the screen 
        last year in <i>Minority Report</i> and hasn't been able to let go since, 
        plays the part well enough to keep us interested, but not with enough 
        real vigor to flex his acting muscles (if he's got any-I have yet to see 
        them). Forest Whitaker, the stereotypically sympathetic head cop, practically 
        a copy of the <i>Family Matters</i> guy in <i>Die Hard</i>, came off saying 
        his lines like he was in a &quot;The More You Know&quot; NBC &quot;morality 
        outreach&quot; public service announcement. The voice of the sniper, done 
        by Kiefer Sutherland, star of 24, was admittedly creepy, but probably 
        would have fit better on a cartoon villain. Katie Holmes whined even more 
        on the phone than she ever did on <i>Dawson's Creek</i>; heck, the whole 
        cast acted like they were on some overplayed television rerun. </p>
      <p align="left"> All in all, the camera, the editing, and the plot were 
        the film's saving graces. Though it's certainly not Oscar-worthy by any 
        standards, <i>Phone Booth</i> is no spring dud; this is one of the only 
        movies out there right now that could be worth your time and money. &quot;A 
        ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?&quot; Go ahead. Pick it 
        up. You know you want to. </p>
