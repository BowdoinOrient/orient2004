        <font size="2">ERIK SPRAGUE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Currently there are much more important matters to get all 
        riled up over, but one sports issue that has gotten increasingly annoying 
        over the past several years is that of bandwagon fans. For those who are 
        not exactly sure what a bandwagon fan is and/or if they would qualify 
        as one, a band wagon fan is a fan-or at least a self-proclaimed fan-whose 
        decision to watch and support a particular sports team is based primarily 
        on the given team's success. </p>
      <p align="left">
        One recent example of a bandwagon fan I encountered is my roommate, who 
        shall remain nameless so as to allow him to keep his dignity. His origins 
        reside in Fort Worth, Texas. About two weeks ago, he made a concerted 
        effort to root for the University of Texas men's basketball team in its 
        Sweet 16 match-up with UConn. </p>
      <p align="left">
        He invited upwards of ten people to come over and watch the game with 
        him in our apartment. As the game proceeded, he vigorously rooted on &quot;his&quot; 
        team, dressed in a Texas state flag that he wore as a cape. Immediately 
        after the game ended, in which Texas emerged victorious, he stepped up 
        on a table in our common room and began to sing a University of Texas 
        school song in a loud, ringing voice. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While normally such passion would be commendable, in this case, it was 
        hardly sincere. In fact, this was one of the select few University of 
        Texas men's basketball games he watched all season. And moreover, he didn't 
        even watch its Elite Eight match-up with Michigan State two days later. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact is my roommate was not being a &quot;real&quot; fan that day. 
        He hadn't witnessed the ups and downs Texas went through over the course 
        of the season. Thus, unlike &quot;real&quot; Texas men's basketball fans, 
        he had little or no emotional stake in whether Texas won or lost. In fact, 
        he didn't give it a second thought when Texas lost to Syracuse in the 
        Final Four two days later. All he did was show up for the last hurrah, 
        and in doing so, cemented his stature as simply another annoying bandwagon 
        fan. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I realize that many do not consider sports very important in relation 
        to their daily lives, and that they look at sports as merely another form 
        of entertainment. This is understandable, but there are many others out 
        there that put a lot of time and money into watching and supporting their 
        favorite sports teams. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These people watch most, if not all, of their teams' games. They don't 
        just watch their teams when it fits their schedules or when their teams 
        are winning. In fact, almost the exact opposite is true. They accommodate 
        their teams' schedules so that it fits in their everyday lives-with work 
        being the sole exception. Additionally, whether or not their teams are 
        successful does not dictate their level of support. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If you indeed qualify as a bandwagon fan, this obviously does not make 
        you a bad person. But please don't attempt to convey the impression that 
        you are a &quot;real&quot; fan because doing so belittles sports by placing 
        it on a par with mere entertainment. And, for many of us, it is so much 
        more.</p>
