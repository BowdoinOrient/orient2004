        HUMOR COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> While walking across the Quad this morning, someone asked 
        me, &quot;Do you smell that?&quot; Well, I have been pretty stuffed up 
        lately, so I can't smell a thing. I had no idea where he was going with 
        this, but two possibilities ran through my mind. First, I was late to 
        class and didn't shower. I'm not proud of it, but at least I showered 
        the evening before. I think if anything that places me in the top fifth 
        percentile of personal hygiene achievement at this school. I didn't stink; 
        must be something else. Wait-was this scent the elusive but sweet smell 
        of spring? I had to know. I told him that I had lost my sense of smell 
        and anxiously awaited the good news. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Smells like burning pine,&quot; he replied. Okay, well, that seemed 
        a little random to me, but I'll just have to take his word for it. The 
        disappointment on my pale sun-starved face was obvious. He continued, 
        &quot;No, I'm sorry to say it, but it's not the smell of spring.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        This is like Groundhog Day all over again: &quot;Sorry, no spring, it 
        smells like people are burning wood for comfort. You're condemned to three 
        more months of big jackets and chapped lips.&quot; This is ridiculous. 
        Where the hell is El Ni&ntilde;o when you need him? </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;That's unfair,&quot; I mumbled back. He laughed, whether out of 
        pity or confusion I'm not sure, but I was serious. This weather is just 
        plain old unfair. Everyday I wake up with the same wintry dry throat and 
        stuffy nose. I walk to class in a big puffy blue jacket that makes me 
        look like a frozen smurf. I walk back to my apartment in the evening and 
        kneel in front of my girlfriend's space heater like I am some sort of 
        hell-fire worshipping freak. </p>
      <p align="left">
        No one can escape its depressing grip. Look around campus and you will 
        see the signs of desperation everywhere. Last Friday our activities fee 
        actually went towards having some guy regurgitate billiard balls on campus. 
        If I wanted to watch that sort of stuff, I'd attend more campus-wides. 
        Oh, and by the way, how did the College find the time to build a tunnel 
        between Baxter and Ladd for the time warp party when the pothole by Moulton 
        Union remains untouched? Does it have to be as big as Curtis Pool before 
        someone fills the darn thing? I don't know, maybe if we wait long enough 
        the pothole fairies will just take care of it. The other day I peered 
        down into the pothole. Keep it on the down low, but I think I found Jimmy 
        Hoffa.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In light of the dismal conditions, it is actually kind of funny watching 
        our admission tour guides try to make Bowdoin appealing to the visiting 
        prospects. &quot;Actually, no, it isn't bitterly cold and miserable here 
        all the time. No, sir, the blinking crane and trailer park are not a permanent 
        fixture. Now here we are at the Smith Union, formally known as the Cage-no, 
        Sir, I don't know what that is on the Polar Bear's butt.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        It's not just me anymore; everyone is on edge. Consider this: Howell House 
        is actually hosting an event called, &quot;Who Killed Barry Mills?&quot; 
        Whoa, relax my chemical-free brethren. Truth be told, my money is on Dean 
        Bradley in the library with a hammer. Sure, he's a nice guy. Almost too 
        nice&#133;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Okay, so what can we do about this weather? Well, as always, there are 
        options. The first decisive step is to go to the Bowdoin Student Government 
        and pass a resolution condemning the prolonged cold weather. I'm sure 
        the BSG would be receptive; I mean, bad weather is something that they 
        have no control over. Right up their alley. After that, I think we should 
        have an en masse student walk out. That'll teach 'em.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I guess this weather makes me feel sort of bamboozled. Global warming: 
        what a vicious lie. Here I have been using a carabineer coffee mug to 
        save the earth. Forget the earth, I want warmth! Sustainable Bowdoin? 
        Try Sustainable Winter. I say all of us fill our little blue recycling 
        bins with newspaper and meet on the quad for a bonfire. How's that for 
        the sweet smell of spring?</p>
