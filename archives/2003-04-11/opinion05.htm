        <font size="2">BRYANT RICH</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Recently, affirmative action has become a major topic of 
        discussion and one of the more predominant issues in domestic politics. 
        The President has come out in support of outlawing affirmative action 
        programs. The suit brought by two caucasian applicants to the University 
        of Michigan accuses the University of using a disguised quota system that 
        discriminates against white applicants.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It is my observation that conservatives' criticisms of affirmative action 
        are misplaced. They miss the spirit, intent, and effects of affirmative 
        action. Affirmative action is not a discriminatory measure, but rather 
        it seeks to level the playing field for minority applicants who are disproportionately 
        disadvantaged. Its spirit is one that seeks to include, not exclude. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The University of Michigan's point system is not a disguised quota system. 
        It adds 20 points to minority applicants, the economically disadvantaged, 
        and athletes. Upon closer inspection of points categories, one would find 
        that though such things as standardized test tutoring, trips to Europe 
        over the summer to learn languages, trips to national leadership forums, 
        and private schooling can also earn an applicant those 20 points. All 
        of these programs are expensive, but can and are purchased by families 
        with the means-families who are for the most part caucasian. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The President has argued that the University of Texas's guarantee of admissions 
        for anyone in the top ten percent of their high school class will fix 
        the affirmative action gap, but it has not. Minority enrollments for undergraduates 
        at the University of Texas have dwindled. In addition, this plan does 
        not account for graduate and professional school admissions in which minorities 
        have fared even worse at the University of Texas. The disguised quota 
        criticism also fails in that the same point system is applied to all applicants 
        while quotas are not. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Unlike many undergraduate admissions programs of the past, which expressly 
        prohibited minority applicants, affirmative action is clearly not discriminatory. 
        African Americans lack the opportunities of many whites, but the percentage 
        of those enjoying those benefits among African Americans is proportionately 
        much lower. Also, the gap between the wages that African Americans earn 
        and those that whites earn is disproportionately larger. Therefore, minority 
        applicants have a disproportionately fewer advantages in preparation than 
        many whites, so it is illogical to expect minorities to always be able 
        to compete with whites on an equal plane. It is sort of like giving one 
        child a 500 dollar paint set and another a box of magic markers (in many 
        instances) and judging the artwork that they produce by the same standards. 
        While they may both be equally talented artists, the child with the 500 
        dollar paint set is more likely to create better art even if the child 
        with the markers is a better artist. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though it is unpopular to do so, we must recognize why blacks tend to 
        be disproportionately disadvantaged when compared to whites. The Republicans 
        love to take credit for being the party of Lincoln, who freed the slaves, 
        but what about all of the discrimination that blacks have and continue 
        to face? My mother, who attended Howard University for her undergraduate 
        studies, has told me stories of some of her friends (sons and daughters 
        of doctors) whose parents did not allow them to attend Ivy League institutions 
        because they did not want to pay thousands to schools that would not accept 
        them. Society continues to feel these effects to this day, despite all 
        of the progress we have made.</p>
      <p align="left">
        One is able to find evidence of this in the popular conservative argument 
        that affirmative action dilutes admissions standards. What about the credit 
        that students receive for being descendent from alumni? This often gives 
        applicants an added boost in their admissions profile (George W. should 
        be especially familiar with this concept). Those that receive this boost 
        are disproportionately Caucasian yet no conservatives have spoken out 
        against these sorts of &quot;Old Boy&quot; advantages. </p>
      <p align="left">
        It is also interesting that many conservatives are in favor of racial 
        profiling in law enforcement which definitely harms African Americans 
        but are up in arms over race based profiling that may, potentially work 
        to their detriment.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Let us not forget that discrimination still exists. Over our semester 
        break The New York Times and The Boston Globe carried an article that 
        described staggering statistics which showed that minorities with distinctively 
        ethnic names (i.e. Jamal) were less likely to receive interviews at companies 
        than those who had Anglo-Saxon names. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There is no easy answer to the Affirmative Action question. In my conversations 
        with Caucasian friends, concerning affirmative action, they have expressed 
        sympathy for my position even though some felt as though they had received 
        the short end of the affirmative action stick. While I had no easy answer 
        for them all that I could was offer my sympathies. For minorities and 
        women, the primary recipients of the benefits of affirmative action, even 
        if affirmative action as we know it is ended there will always be this 
        problem: no matter how much we achieve we are always open to the criticism 
        that our achievements are a result of racial preferences.</p>
