      <p align="left">Steve Earle's latest LP: five stars out of five</p>
      <p>&quot;Lately, I feel like the loneliest man in America. Frankly, I've 
        never worn red, white, and blue that well. I grew up in the sixties, and 
        grew to associate the slogan 'AMERICA, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT' with every 
        appearance of that flag. Back then, as now, it was suggested by some that 
        second-guessing our leaders in a time of crisis was unpatriotic if not 
        downright treasonous. We sent 55,000 of our sons to die far from home 
        in the belief that if we didn't arrest what we perceived as an 'evil empire' 
        abroad that the last domino would ultimately fall at our doorstep&#133;Well, 
        we survived that and I believe we will survive this. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It's always best to keep it in mind that every tower ever built 
        tumbles no matter how strong no matter how tall.&quot; -Steve Earle</p>
      <p align="left">
        Steve Earle, in his thirteenth album Jerusalem, asks tough questions and 
        does not care if you agree with him. A self-proclaimed patriot, eighth-grade 
        dropout and Tennessee rebel, Earle has always existed as country music's 
        burly, troubled son-a man who refuses to let go of the gritty, quarrelsome 
        style of his heroes-Johnny Cash and Merle Haggard. Earle's agenda has 
        always been to take the humanizing tradition of those men and place it 
        within today's current political climate. Therefore, his songs cannot 
        only be about lonely men in Folsom Prison or gakked-out cocaine addicts 
        who kill their wives, but must stretch further to embrace global-era issues 
        like the Israeli/Palestininian conflict, the attacks on the World Trade 
        Center, and the capture of American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        This is a difficult task-one that takes an incredible amount of thought 
        and sensitivity, while walking the difficult political tightrope between 
        bland party lines and senseless, reactionary rhetoric. Steve Earle does 
        not want to be Zach de la Rocha any more than he wants to be Toby Keith. 
        He wants to be his own man with his own opinions and in Jerusalem, he 
        pulls off a rare feat of originality and political iconoclasm in music 
        where the image of the man is overshadowed by the strength of his convictions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        By far, the iconic song on Jerusalem, and the one that caused the largest 
        controversy is the track titled &quot;John Walker's Blues&quot;-an ode 
        to the Marin county boy who left America to go fight with the Taliban. 
        In interviews he has explained his motivations for writing the song by 
        saying, &quot;he's a 20 year-old kid. My son Justin is almost exactly 
        Walker's age. Would I be upset if he suddenly turned up fighting for the 
        Islamic Jihad? Sure, absolutely&#133;but there are circumstances. . .He 
        didn't just sit on the couch and watch the box, get depressed and complain. 
        He was a smart kid, he graduated from high school early, the culture here 
        didn't impress him, so he went out looking for something to believe in.&quot; 
        This sentiment is reflected in the song's lyrics which attempt to humanize 
        Lindh as an angry, confused teenager from the suburbs led too far astray: 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I'm just an American boy-raised on MTV/ and I've seen all those 
        kids in the soda pop ads but none of them looked like me./ So I started 
        lookin' around for a light out of the dim/ and the first thing I heard 
        that made sense was the word of Mohammed, peace be unto him.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Earle's compassion for a &quot;boy who could be anyone's son&quot; shows 
        his allegiance to a type of American that sadly seems to be dying out-that 
        fierce patriot who is willing to ask tough questions of his country while 
        maintaining compassion for his fellow citizens. It's a tougher position 
        to take than to join in all of the flag waving or the picket-sign waving, 
        but it's completely necessary to serve as a model for an open-minded, 
        democratic, compassionate citizen who is uneffected both by the nightly 
        news or by the charge that comes with the cheap politicized anger that 
        comes with the rejection of so-called American values. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Isn't it fantastic and so predictable that the only important political 
        song released in our generation comes not from a pink-haired lesbian with 
        black fingernails or from the Beastie Boys or from some dreadlocked rap-rocker, 
        but from a middle-aged, bearded fat man who wears flannel shirts and spent 
        a good portion of the past ten years shooting heroin and listening to 
        Dr. Dre's The Chronic? I suppose it proves that thoughtful protest takes 
        maturity and the necessary time to grow out of the self-indulgent days 
        of the mean reds. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The man who stands alone always has the biggest balls and his iconoclasm 
        should define what people are proud of when they say the word &quot;American.&quot; 
        It's a difficult concept to grasp, especially in times of great emotional 
        upheaval and political divisiveness when the inclination is always to 
        follow one's convictions till they turn into indignation. Indignation 
        always has its bandwagons and we see them today in many forms. We either 
        love or hate the songs of Toby Keith, &quot;Freedom Fries,&quot; the Bowdoin 
        Student Coalition Against Pre-emptive Military Action in Iraq, musicians 
        against the war, Michael Moore's Oscar speech, or the backlash and back-backlash 
        against Hootie Johnson's little golf club in Georgia. The amassing of 
        people behind causes has its practical purposes-very few people take one 
        man's protest seriously, especially when he dares to ask those tough questions 
        both sides skirt over-but sometimes a unified voice lacks the authority 
        that a truly original one might have.</p>
      <p><b>The Bowdoin Coalition Against Pre-emptive Action in Iraq: zero stars 
        out of five</b></p>
      <p>When all hundred and fifty of you were stacked on top of one another, 
        literally breathing down the necks of the Student Government, you ensured 
        that there was to be no fair, open discussion on the topic of war on Iraq. 
        When you clapped too loudly for any sort of recycled '60s sentiment and 
        turned and whispered fiercely whenever an opposing opinion came up, you 
        all knew what you were doing, but didn't seem to care. It must be nice 
        to be in a club with so many members.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I would call it a mob. When the only real reason you can come up with 
        when asked why it even matters that the Student Government of Bowdoin 
        passes this resolution is that you're tired of an apathetic campus full 
        of Republicans, well you pretty much sealed your fate with me. Who supports 
        indignation for indignation's sake alone? </p>
      <p align="left">
        Most of you are smart and even more of you are articulate. You can't wait 
        to tee off on any stumbling kid who might have a differing opinon because 
        your rhetoric is so much more polished and well-structured. You've practiced 
        the argument in your head and your vanquishing of the poor kid's ego is 
        your real agenda. You had 950 signatures and all those videoclips from 
        Woodstock and the streets of San Francisco egging you on. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And it's not that that bothers me. It's the eye-rolling, it's the closed-mided 
        dismissal of any opinon that might stand outside of whatever you've rehearsed 
        in front of the mirror at night, it's the abandonment of those very principles 
        of free speech and dissent that you so champion when its your turn to 
        speak, but then turn around and absolutely abuse when anyone else has 
        an opinion. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Your whispering, chastising and ridiculous indignation has its costs and 
        free speech and open discussion on this campus has been sacrificed and 
        I can't help but think that it's all of your faults. What happened in 
        that Student Government meeting was pure bullying and when one officer 
        had the balls to object, you all turned and hated him for expressing himself-the 
        Student Government officer who was objecting to how you were all trying 
        to run his meeting with your own agendas. Well, congratulations, your 
        mob had their day and you've filled your quota for &quot;college indignation.&quot;</p>
