        <font size="2">YARON EISENBERG</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As America finds itself directly confronted by the threat 
        of global terrorist networks, particularly those that affiliate themselves 
        with Islamic fundamentalists, secular Arab nationalists, and the states 
        that support them, it becomes imperative to find a method of effectively 
        combating the danger. In order to stem the problem, one must understand 
        the reasons why an organization employs terrorism on the scale and manner 
        in which it has recently been executed. Contrary to the popular perspective, 
        terrorism is a tactic chosen not based upon social injustice and desperation, 
        but because of its effectiveness and acceptance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Too often scholars and students alike cite very emotionally charged and 
        sometimes misguided arguments in order to identify roots for modern terrorism. 
        Such arguments generally consist of, but are not limited to, the economic 
        divide between the capitalist West, mainly America, and the exploitation 
        of the developing world. There are also other socio-economic questions: 
        U.S. foreign policy, specifically the close relationship between the U.S. 
        and Israel, and the classic Israeli and Palestinian, or Arab, conflict. 
        Providing any combination of the above list as possible explanations for 
        why terrorism exists in its current manifestation is a grave error. </p>
      <p align="left">
        One should not be deceived by his or her heart and necessarily buy into 
        the common arguments justifying the motives of terrorists. For instance, 
        a common reason for animosity towards America, which is also cited as 
        a reason for terrorism, is that the U.S. offers support to Israel and 
        is inherently anti-Arab. In fact, it is quite the contrary. The United 
        States has provided tremendous support to Arab states, in the form of 
        military arms to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and others along with large 
        amounts of aid and political support to the region. The U.S. is also seen 
        as anti-Muslim; however, Muslims in the United States enjoy more freedoms 
        than non-Muslims and many Muslims do in Iran. And if economic distribution 
        is the question, then why does Saudi Arabia, an extraordinarily wealthy 
        state, promote terrorism carried out by Islamic fundamentalist groups 
        around the world?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Islamic fundamentalists have a worldview-a worldview that is anti-democratic 
        and contrary to the free world's vision of the future. Groups like al-Qaeda 
        and Hezbollah, sponsored by states such as Iran and Syria, engage in actions 
        against the U.S. in order to confront the real threat to their power, 
        the movement of liberalism and democracy. Such groups choose terrorism 
        as the main channel of operation because they are not confronted by a 
        negative reaction abroad; instead, their actions are met with sympathy, 
        and in turn, appeasement.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In his book Why Terrorism Works, renowned Harvard Law professor and author 
        Alan M. Dershowitz, discusses this very point. He charts brilliantly how 
        the world has in fact encouraged the use of terrorism as a tool. One such 
        example that he points to is when the U.N. offered the PLO observer status 
        on November 22, 1974, despite vicious terrorist attacks in recent years, 
        including the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes by a PLO splinter 
        group, Black September. Why should organizations not use terrorism when 
        the world offers them concessions on a silver platter? The real question 
        is, can the world stomach the vision of Islamic fundamentalism?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Terrorism is a tactic used by a variety of groups, spreading over a vast 
        history that transcends country, culture, religion, society, economic 
        lines, and political structures. The fact that the world has not unequivocally 
        opposed the targeted killing of innocents, for whatever gains or grievances, 
        has only perpetuated the problem. Dershowitz says it best when he suggests, 
        &quot;The real root cause of terrorism is that it is successful-terrorists 
        have consistently benefited from their terrorist acts. Terrorism will 
        persist as long as it continues to work for those who use it, as long 
        as the international community rewards it, as it has been doing for the 
        past thirty-five years.&quot;</p>
