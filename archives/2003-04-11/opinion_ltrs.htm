      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> I believe that there are two challenges that everyone, given the opportunity, 
        should experience. One is climbing a mountain. The other is triathlon.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Triathlon originated in the 1978 as a challenge between a naval officer 
        and two of his men stationed in Hawaii. They were each proficient in a 
        different athletic area-swimming, biking, or running-and often argued 
        over who was in the best physical shape. To figure out the answer, the 
        men decided to compete head-to-head in a &quot;multi-sport event,&quot; 
        which included each of their respective sports. They chose the distances 
        based on the longest races that existed in Hawaii at the time: a 2.4 mile 
        ocean swim, a 112 mile bike, and a marathon (26.2 mile) run. When these 
        events were put back-to-back, and the crucial element of &quot;transitioning&quot; 
        (changing from one sport to the next) was added, the Ironman, and more 
        importantly triathlon, was born.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the 25 years since then, triathlon has exploded in popularity in the 
        United States and around the world. There are now races across this country 
        that incorporate different distances (much shorter than the Ironman) and 
        present new challenges for competitors. Triathlon made its Olympic debut 
        in 2000. This May, it will arrive at Bowdoin.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I invite you to join me at the inaugural IronBear Sprint Triathlon, to 
        take place on Sunday, May 4 at 8:00 a.m. It will consist of a 525 yard 
        (21 length) pool swim, 11 mile bike, and 3.1 mile run. All proceeds from 
        the event will go to the Brunswick Recreation Department, specifically 
        to benefit youth athletic programs. The IronBear is designed for both 
        &quot;first-timers&quot; (people who have never competed before) and experienced 
        triathletes looking to get a fast start to the season. Its goal is to 
        promote healthy living and fitness among the college and town communities 
        through an exciting event open to everyone. We are anticipating a field 
        of participants of all skill levels from Bowdoin, Brunswick, and New England. 
        U.S.A. Triathlon, the national governing body, has sanctioned the race. 
        This means that it meets their high standards and will count toward national 
        rankings. I encourage anyone who has ever been intrigued by the sport 
        to give the IronBear a &quot;tri.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left"> For more information and registration, check out the website 
        at www.bowdoin.edu/athletics and click on the IronBear link. I look forward 
        to seeing you at the finish line!</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Answer Kielburger's call to action</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>The outpouring of enthusiasm following Craig Kielburger's talk last week 
        has been wonderful and overwhelming. School supplies have poured into 
        the Union, where students compiled school kits to send to children overseas, 
        and there has already been serious inquiry into funding the construction 
        of a school overseas. At a meeting last weekend, folks energized by Craig's 
        talk brainstormed dozens of ideas of what to do next. The question is 
        not &quot;Should I be involved?&quot; but, &quot;Where is my energy best 
        directed?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Certainly, the alleviation of the grinding poverty facing children around 
        the world is a noble goal. While these conditions should be ameliorated, 
        however, our efforts must also be directed toward working for systemic 
        changes that address the root causes of poverty and inequality. If poverty 
        is a disease, of course we should treat the symptoms; more importantly, 
        let's find a cure.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Processes of globalization have underscored global inequality and exploited 
        the poorest in our world. As Kielburger suggested, the current structure 
        of the global economy benefits multinational corporations and those at 
        the top of the economic ladder at the expense of those at the bottom. 
        From the coffee served by our dining halls to the Bowdoin sweatshirts 
        we wear, Bowdoin is implicated in this global economy. Organizations like 
        Global Help, Bowdoin Students for Democratic Socialism, and others are 
        working on these issues. Get involved. As a community committed to the 
        Common Good, let us take it upon ourselves to address this both on our 
        campus and beyond.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Molly Farneth '03</p>
