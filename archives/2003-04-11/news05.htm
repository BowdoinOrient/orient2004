        <font size="2">SAM DOWNING<br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Imagine that a stranger on the street shows you a series 
        of black and white photos. The first shows a plump, older man wearing 
        a stained white t-shirt and plaid shorts. He's standing in front of a 
        screen door. In the second, a young couple poses with two small children 
        on white carpet inside a house with gleaming brass banisters and no art 
        to speak of. The third features a strawberry blonde woman wearing slacks 
        and a blouse standing with her back to a false-wood grain wall. Can you 
        guess what social class each one belongs to?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Louis Alvarez and Andrew Kolker think so. The producers of the first documentary 
        entirely about social class, &quot;People Like Us,&quot; spoke at Bowdoin 
        on April 7.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We found that America is a very segregated place by class,&quot; 
        Alvarez explained. &quot;By and large, we don't interact with people of 
        other classes in any sort of meaningful way,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the production process, which began in 1996 and ended with the first 
        screening in September 2001, Alvarez and Kolker interviewed hundreds of 
        ordinary and extraordinary Americans, hoping to hold a mirror to the nation 
        to gauge the role social class plays in modern society. The project took 
        them from Texas sororities and Ohio trailer parks, to urban townhouses 
        in Maryland and summer communities on Long Island.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But the original idea of testing whether strangers would be willing to 
        sort a series of pictures based on social class turned out to be the most 
        telling. While people fumbled to define what it was exactly that made 
        them call Subject A upper middle class and Subject B working class, they 
        never hesitated to volunteer an opinion. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;People do know about class,&quot; Kolker said. &quot;The reality 
        is contrary to the myth that America is somehow a class-free society. 
        People do pay attention to class. They just don't have the vocabulary 
        to talk about it.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        While the pair believed the tensions their documentary exposed were quite 
        important, they felt the best way to present them was to try and draw 
        in as wide an audience as possible. They already knew the film medium 
        was more egalitarian and accessible than a strictly academic forum. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We pride ourselves on having a sense of humor,&quot; Alvarez said. 
        In addition to the lighthearted approach, they also provided treatment 
        of many social classes and tried not to make too much fun of any one of 
        them. Also, they hoped to avoid the condescension of some documentaries.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;We wanted to make a film that could be approached from any social 
        level. We tried not to be hierarchical in assuming that the audience would 
        be upper middle class college students,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;This 
        is something my mother and the doorman in my office building will both 
        get something out of.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Most people interviewed were happy with how they looked in the film, according 
        to the producers. People self-identified their social status, and were 
        self-effacing when talking about the company they kept. A Baltimore Sun 
        columnist who says he was raised in a working class family poked affectionate 
        fun at the idea that lawn ornaments -neocolonial columns and wind ornaments-added 
        culture to a yard. In a section called 'WASP Lessons,' an elderly woman 
        warned that driving a Mercedes made after '89 makes you 'nouveau riche.' 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The most telegenic person lived in a trailer set on cinderblocks in southern 
        Ohio. Tammy, a mother of two, walked ten miles to work, at a job cleaning 
        bathrooms at Burger King. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;She really wanted to tell her story, she was very proud to finally 
        be recognized,&quot; Kolker said. Unlike many of the subjects, she immediately 
        understood how to speak in front of the camera, something that requires 
        telling a personal narrative without interruption from the filmmakers.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alvarez and Kolker urged the audience to try out filmmaking. With a few 
        techniques and the low cost of equipment, &quot;this is a great time to 
        get involved,&quot; Kolker said.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alvarez and Kolker met working for a VISTA program in Louisiana and have 
        been making films together for 25 years. Although neither attended film 
        school, they have caught the eye of the establishment several times, winning 
        both the Peabody Award and the duPont-Columbia Journalism Award. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Over the years, the duo has focused in on an exceptionally broad array 
        of subjects. They created &quot;American Tongues,&quot; a study on the 
        relationship between regional accents and attitudes, in 1988, &quot;Louisiana 
        Boys - Raised on Politics&quot; in 1993, and more recently &quot;L.A. 
        Is It with John Gregory Dunne&quot; and &quot;The Japanese Version,&quot; 
        a study on what happens to American culture when it reaches Japan.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Their production companies are the Center for New American Media and Kingfish 
        Productions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The lecture and screenings were sponsored by the department of Sociology 
        and Anthropology and introduced by Susan Bell, A. Myrick Freeman Professor 
        of Social Sciences and chair of the department.</p>
