      <p align="left">Due to stormy conditions in New England last Saturday, the 
        Bowdoin Sailing Team did not race in every regatta on its schedule. Because 
        the boats were iced over at M.I.T., the women's regatta was canceled. 
        The sailors at the Metro Series toughed it out but only sailed four races 
        before the event was called. The sole complete regatta took place in Boston 
        on the Charles River.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Pieter Sheerlink '05 sailed with Sabrina Hall-Little '06 in the A-division, 
        while Caitlin Moore '06 sailed with Kendall Brown '06 in the B-division. 
        Moore did a stellar job skippering her first regatta and even finished 
        mid fleet after a rocky start when she capsized during her first race. 
        However, she soon picked up the pace and contended well with the competition. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Down at the Coast Guard Academy, Bowdoin sailors competed in their second 
        sloop event of the season. Ryan Cauley '03 skippered while Tyler Dunphy 
        '03 handled the jibe and spinnaker, and Eddie Briganti '05 did the foredeck. 
        Because all three crewmembers are officially skippers in dingy boats, 
        they were able to work well together by combining tactics. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Dunphy was able to keep his head out of the boat and make wise decisions 
        so Cauley could concentrate on perfecting his &quot;crisp&quot; boat-handling. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking back on the day, Dunphy said, &quot;We were at or near the top 
        three in most of the last races. The current was ripping so that made 
        life interesting at the windward marks. However, in our final race of 
        the day we ended up in second place so that was an accomplishment for 
        us!&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The boys ended the day happy with a fourth place finish overall and look 
        forward to attending more sloop regattas. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sunday proved to be the first sunny and clear conditions in which the 
        sailors were able to compete all season. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Down at Roger Williams, the coed team engaged in its first team race regatta 
        of the season. Dunphy skippered with Melanie Keene '03, while Cauley sailed 
        with Gia Upchurch '05, and Eddie Briganti sailed with Whitney Rauschenbach 
        '06. Although they had a tough day, they managed one stellar win. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Cauley/Upchurch team gained valuable racing experience during the 
        regatta. Generally, they were caught in the middle and had two of their 
        opponents' boats right on top of them. The Dunphy/Keene team received 
        some good practice for this coming weekend. The duo managed to speed around 
        the marks ahead of its opponents who were more concerned team-racing Cauley.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally, the first years sailed at Brown University on Sunday. While it 
        was a beautiful day, the race committee was fearful of heavy winds and 
        cut the regatta short. However, Emily Bruns '06 and Ellen Grenley '06 
        in the A-division and Frank Pizzo '06 and Sophie Wiss '06 in the B-division 
        did have successful races. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Both boats were pumped up from their spring practice in Galveston, Texas 
        and were ready to show off their 420 experience. However, because of the 
        shortened regatta, they only had three races in which to display their 
        skills. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Bruns/Grenley team geared up throughout the day and took third place 
        in their second race. As Bruns recalled, &quot;It was extremely important 
        to hike as hard as possible to go fast upwind; then we flew downwind and 
        were able to catch several boats.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Pizzo/Wiss team also sailed a solid regatta and took third place. 
        They would have finished near the top of their fleet had they not capsized 
        at the start of the second race. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This weekend brings another two days packed with action-filled regattas. 
        The women's team will sail at an intersectional at Brown, as they practice 
        for the championship next week. The coed team will compete at the fifty-second 
        annual B.U. trophy on the Charles River. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The first years will be at Tufts, and a sloop team will be sent down to 
        the Coast Guard Academy. Additionally, for those of you interested in 
        watching some hot sailing in cold waters, travel down to the University 
        of Southern Maine on Saturday, and watch Bowdoin sailors compete in an 
        Eastern Series event.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After all, if you stay at Bowdoin, you won't be able to see the hottest 
        sailing team in New England.</p>
