      <p align="left"><font size="5">Students strive to balance athletics with academics</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">MARIO N. LOPEZ<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">At Bowdoin College, over 50 percent of the student body population is athletes, which makes these students an integral part of campus life. Participating in athletics allows students to develop and implement self-discipline, time management, and decision-making skills, all while maintaining and improving their physical condition. </p>
<p align="left">Student athletes may be just as productive in the classroom as they are on the court, field, and rink. The responsibility they accept in balancing a full academic workload while complying with the exhausting demands of sports is effort-intensive. </p>
<p align="left">This task is easy for those athletes whose sport is a relief from all the stress and anxiety created by academics. The passion that they have for sports motivates them to excel in the classroom, and playing on a sports team is envisioned as a reward. For others, being a student athlete is something that they are simply determined to do. In either case the student must be able to do what is necessary to balance athletics and academics.</p>
<p align="left">Michael Fensterstock '04 of the men's squash team said, "I feel that the commitment to a team helps one grow as a person. It is easy to be physically fit, but it is the mental aspect of both athletics and academia that allow one to excel."</p>
<p align="left">"To be an effective student athlete I think one must know themselves and know how much time and effort is necessary for them to keep their grades up," said Bree Dallinga '06 of the women's volleyball team. </p>
<p align="left"> Although time management is one of the most important concepts to learn in college, it's also the hardest to apply. The easiest way to get through the day is to have everything planned out.  Juggling classes, practice, study time, and eating requires a lot of planning. The pressure to stay engaged and committed to these activities is what allows student athletes to manage their time. As a result they are able to use time wisely, which in turn allows them to accomplish more.</p>
<p align="left">Dallinga said, "It's actually easier to get work done during the season because I know I only have a limited amount of time, therefore I schedule and plan accordingly. Outside of season I think I have all the time in the world so I leave work to the last minute."</p>
<p align="left">Brian Laurits '04 of the men's indoor track team said, "Whether or not I am able to successfully manage my time determines whether or not I am a successful student athlete. My academics are my first priority, so when I'm in season, practices and competitions require me to schedule my day accordingly. I am a much better student when I am in season."</p>
<p align="left">Student athletes have to make important decisions in dealing with athletics and academics. Although playing a sport is a commitment, education should alway comes first. Student athletes are always conscious of this fact, which is why they are able to make good decisions when athletics and academics become conflicting issues.</p>
<p align="left">"I chose Bowdoin and Division III because academics come first and athletics follow. Every once in a while I reach a point where I have to decide between the two, and in every case I choose academics," said Laurits. </p>
<p align="left">Another added element to this equation is the coaches. Advice and suggestions from coaches to players are very helpful, and having a coach's support in a player's decision is comforting.</p>
<p align="left">Studying abroad is a decision that every student athlete makes. Only the athlete can make this decision, although a coach's opinion can influence the outcome. Students can only study abroad once during their college career, but they can participate in intercollegiate athletics for four years. Three years of sports and one year abroad seems to be a compromising balance of athletics and academics, yet some athletes are so committed to their sport that they may not even consider studying abroad.</p>
<p align="left">Preseason All-American and co-captain of the women's basketball team Lora Trenkle '04 said, "I definitely did consider studying abroad and I actually thought about it extensively. In my opinion, you can enjoy the freedom of travel anytime during the course of your lifetime but you only have the opportunity of experiencing four years of college life at Bowdoin College. I am happy with the decision I made and feel that I have grown in ways that an experience abroad may not have fulfilled."</p>
<p align="left">Trenkle's coach, Stefanie Pemper, thinks that going abroad is a vacation for most students.  Pemper feels that students should go abroad if it contributes to their major or if they truly want to make the most out of an intellectual experience.</p>
<p align="left">Nathan Riddell '05 of the Men's Ice Hockey Team said, "My decision not to study abroad was a mixture of not wanting to miss part of the season and not wanting to leave Coach Meagher and the team in an important time of the year."</p>
<p align="left">"Coach McGonagle never had a problem with us going abroad, but it's hard to jump into the middle of a season and be both mentally and physically ready to play," said Marissa O'Neil '05 of the Women's Ice Hockey Team.</p>
<p align="left">"Although coach did not influence my decision, I felt as if I would be letting him and my teammates down by coming in midway during the season," said O'Neil.</p>
<p align="left">Studying abroad is a very tough decision for athletes. It has its pros and cons, but the most popular decision among athletes is to stay at Bowdoin and continue with their sport. There is much to gain from a complete four-year education at Bowdoin as there is with experiencing a year of education outside of Bowdoin. </p>
<p align="left">Both athletics and academics allow student athletes to set high goals and by doing so they dedicate themselves to success. Their dedication compels them to prioritize, improve work ethics, and become better decision- makers. In essence, athletics compliment and complete a college education for many students.</p>
