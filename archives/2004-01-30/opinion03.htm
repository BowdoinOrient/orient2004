      <p align="left"><font size="5">Not necessarily a problem</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">SCOTT MACEACHERN<br>FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>      <p align="left">Not enough Republicans on the faculty at Bowdoin? "Quelle horreur!" But  what should we do to remedy this situation? Ask job candidates whether  they're Democrats or Republicans? Well, no, we can't, won't, and shouldn't do that and, besides, the problem is not actually that there aren't enough Republican faculty on campus. Well, I'm a Canadian and vote for neither the Democrats nor  the Republicans. But, the problem is that there are not enough conservative faculty on campus. Or is it?  </p>
<p align="left">The report by the Center for the Study of Popular Culture (not the  Center for Popular Culture) didn't actually survey the whole professoriate on campuses. Rather, it looked at a limited number of  departments in the social sciences and humanities. There are a number of studies of political attitudes among university and college faculty, and these tend to indicate that faculty in the social sciences and  humanities are politically more liberal than those in the natural  sciences and engineering. Perhaps there are proportionately more Republican faculty members in those latter departments at Bowdoin.  Careful choice of departments surveyed thus allows the CSPC to increase  the shock-and-horror quotient of its survey results.  </p>
<p align="left">On to the Center for the Study of Popular Culture itself. The CSPC is  run by David Horowitz, a well-known conservative commentator who back in  the 1960s was a student organizer for the Students for a Democratic  Society and who then was busily attacking universities and colleges for  being too conservative. </p>
<p align="left">The mission remains the same; only the politics change. CSPC is only part of Horowitz's empire; he is best-known for running FrontPage Magazine.com, which is an online source of  conservative commentary. The flavor of FrontPage can be taken from an article in today's (December 5) version, where patriotic Americans are advised to avoid the movie The Last Samurai, because the Tom Cruise character is too reminiscent of John Walker Lindh, the "American Taliban." The movie is apparently "...a Hollywood sermon on the evils of bourgeois  liberalism." </p>
<p align="left">The faculty survey doesn't seem to be run by the CSPC itself, but  rather by Students for Academic Freedom, which bills itself as "a  clearing-house and communications center for a national coalition of  student organizations whose goal is to end the political abuse of the university..." with 105 university and college chapters across the  country. But the SFAF Web page belongs to Horowitz's organisation, and  donations go to the Center for the Study of Popular Culture.</p>
<p align="left">Tracing the links between these organization-and they'll eventually  lead you to Richard Scaife, Lynne Cheney, and back to our own Bowdoin Patriot,-among other directions-is an  amusing and harmless way to spend a Friday afternoon. There is a larger question at stake here, though: what role should ideology play in the hiring of professors  at Bowdoin?  </p>
<p align="left">The straightforward, and best, answer to this is: none. As Dean McEwen  says, we don't ask job candidates about their political affiliations or views, nor should we. Even David Horowitz appears to agree: the  "Academic Bill of Rights" quoted in the Orient article says that "No  faculty shall be hired or fired or denied promotion or tenure on the  basis of his or her political or religious beliefs." </p>
<p align="left">But this "Academic  Bill of Rights" is actually a fairly equivocal document, because it also  calls for "...a plurality of methodologies and perspectives..." in the arts, social sciences and humanities. The only way to square these two  objectives would be if colleges and universities were to accept the goal  of "intellectual diversity" and start a program of hiring  conservatives for new academic positions, through choice or through fiat. In fact, there have been a number of recent (Republican) political initiatives, in state legislatures and in Washington, that are meant to hurry that process along.  </p>
<p align="left">Careful readers will have noted that the natural sciences, engineering  and related disciplines are exempted from the requirements of Horowitz's  "Academic Bill of Rights," and this is I think an important point. They  are exempted, apparently, because such disciplines deal in "facts," and  Horowitz doesn't want his credibility damaged by anti-evolutionists and  flat-earthers clamouring for a place in the academy. Of course, the  corollary is that in the social and humanities, we don't deal with  facts, but simply opinions (and indoctrination, of course). And one opinion is just as good as another, isn't it?  </p>
<p align="left">Well, no. As an example, take a claim made by Horowitz in another  context, in this case a debate on reparations for slavery in the U.S.  The claim that he made was that Africans were as responsible for the  origins of the African slave trade as were Europeans and  Americans. This is, by the way a popular claim among American conservatives more  generally.  It's a claim about facts, and it can be tested through  examination of the historical, anthropological and archaeological data on the African slave trade. These are all data from the social sciences  and humanities; they are not just opinions. Taken together, they show  that Horowitz's claim is factually incorrect. Should we, then, allow  someone who believes this to claim a faculty position simply because  it's a conservative belief? If not, in what cases should people be  admitted to the Bowdoin faculty because of "intellectual diversity," and  not because they do good, original, interesting academic work?  </p>
<p align="left">The possibility that there might be a factual basis to faculty viewpoints in the social sciences and humanities doesn't occur to David  Horowitz, nor to most of the other commentators calling for "intellectual diversity" in the academy. Very few of these people are academics. Horowitz, for example, doesn't keep the Center for the Study of Popular Culture open by doing rigorous research, or by submitting his  papers to peer review: he keeps it open by pleasing a select set of  conservative sponsors. He has no real sense of how academic  investigation works, and his picture of the academy is a straw man,  convenient only for demolition.  </p>
<p align="left">Daniel Schuberth thinks that at Bowdoin "...the ideological makeup of  the faculty must resemble the ideological makeup of the student body."  That's not the case. Faculty members have to be open to and encouraging  of debate in class, and outside our disciplines our opinions are worth  as much (or as little) as the study and thought that lay behind them.  Within our disciplines, however, we do have something particular to say,  and faculty in anthropology or history are no more bound to accept incorrect information or erroneous inferences than are our colleagues in  physics or chemistry. If that leads to differences in ideology between  faculty and students, so be it.  </p>
