      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Men's Basketball Team, after winning consecutive games on their road trip last weekend to Connecticut College and Wesleyan University, improved to 11-7 on the season and are 2-2 in the NESCAC.  They also defeated the St. Joseph Monks 106-73 on Tuesday.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin battled with the Camels of Conn. College for 45 minutes as this game was not decided within regulation time. The Polar Bears jumped to an early double digit lead within the first two minutes of the game and were sure to make their presence felt. After 12 minutes of play, Sean Walker '05 and Kevin Bradley '07 hit back-to-back three pointers to add to a 15-0 Bowdoin run. The Polar Bears entered halftime ahead 46-34. </p>
<p align="left">The Camels returned with new life in the second half and proceeded to put points on the board in a hurry. The Polar Bears responded each time, however, and would not allow the Camels to advance. The game was tied at 66 apiece with approximately four minutes remaining. Both teams traded baskets to tie the game once more at 68 points until Bradley added a lay-up with a minute remaining in the game. With two seconds left, Camel's guard Derek Kelly was left wide open at the basket for an easy two and was fouled. Kelly missed the free-throw and sent the game into overtime.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin scored the first seven points in OT and T.J. McLeod '04 ran a shooting clinic from the free-throw line to seal the victory at 86-78. McLeod was the leading scorer with 23 points and four assists. Kyle Petrie '06 had 13 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p align="left">The Polar Bears were right on track the following Saturday afternoon to take on the Cardinals of Wesleyan. Bowdoin shot 63.6 percent from three-point range in the first half, connecting on seven of their 11 attempts. McLeod was responsible for three of these long bombs as he scored 13 before the break. </p>
<p align="left">At halftime the Polar Bears led the Cardinals 44-42, but Petrie stepped up on the offensive end in the second half. With less than three minutes remaining, the game was tied at 80. The Cardinals did everything but contain the lanky and versatile six-foot five guard/forward in Petrie. He led all scorers with 26 points as Bowdoin defeated Wesleyan 93-85 to get a sweep for the weekend. Mark Yakavonis '05 had 17 points and six rebounds in the win. </p>
<p align="left">After their weekend sweep, the men have built extreme confidence and are making it clear that they are a contender in the NESCAC. To prove it, they buried St. Joseph 106-73, making it the first time since the fall of 2001 that they have reached the 100-point mark.</p>
<p align="left">Bradley opened the game with consecutive three-pointers and after ten minutes of play Bowdoin led 30-11. Petrie scored 18 and collected seven boards, all in the first 20 minutes of the contest. The Polar Bears stretched their lead to 23 points before entering halftime.</p>
<p align="left">After the break the men put on an exciting display of team basketball for the fans in attendance at the crowded Morrell Gymnasium. Yakavonis, a.k.a. "The Yakster," showed off his array of low post moves including the infamous baseline spin then reverse lay-up. He finished with 17 points. </p>
<p align="left">Eli Maitland '06, a.k.a. "The Rabbi," showed his ball-handling skills as he used a control spin move then a behind-the-back crossover to break St. Joe's defensive pressure. Maitland went scoreless for the night. Nick Ordway '06, a.k.a. "Ole Man River," showed his scoring ability as he nabbed 11 points in 12 minutes off the bench. Corey Gildart '05 brought out the "killer crossover" several times but it appeared to be ineffective.</p>
<p align="left">The men will play their next league game tonight at 7:00 p.m. in Morrell Gym as they host defending national champions Williams.</p>
