      </table>
      <p align="left">The Bowdoin College women's basketball, now with a 17-0 record, is ranked number one in the country in Division III women's basketball according to both D3Hoops.com and WBCA/ESPN's National Poll.  This is a first for the program and the only time since the 1985-1986 men's ice hockey team took the first place ranking that Bowdoin has reached this illustrious spot.</p>
<p align="left">	The team's most recent victory came against Husson on Tuesday night, when the team took the win 70-30, forced 41 turnovers and made 21 steals.  Lora Trenkle '04, one of the team's two captains and a D3Hoops.com pre-season All-American, led the team with 15 points.  They now hold the nation's longest regular-season winning steak with 19 games.</p>
<p align="left">	"No player in NESCAC has been more talented the past four years than Lora Trenkle," said Head Coach Stefanie Pemper.  "She does a ton for us on both ends of the floor and is a total team player so she's pretty special."  Pemper also cited Alison Smith '05, Erika Nickerson '05, Justine Pouravelis '06, and Eileen Flaherty '07 as the major statistical leaders, but said, "All 15 players contribute in significant ways."</p>
<p align="left">	The squad has out-scored and out-rebounded its opponents 1177-730 and 58-47, respectively, with Trenkle at guard averaging 12.4 points a game, Flaherty at forward with 9.5, Nickerson at forward with 7.9, and Pouravelis at forward with 6.8.</p>
<p align="left">Beating the University of Southern Maine, one of the team's biggest rivals, was one of the first indicators of the success that was to follow.  The team won 59-52, holding USM scoreless for eight minutes in the second half.</p>
<p align="left">	Pemper said that the team's 65-61 overtime win against Emmanuel was also noteworthy.  Despite a slow start, Bowdoin led 29-23 at halftime.  A close second half with neither team holding the lead for long led into overtime.  Bowdoin sealed the victory, out-rebounding Emmanuel 51-36.  Nickerson had 15 points, Flaherty had 14 with eight out of nine free-throws, Trenkle had 11, and Pouravelis had nine points, 12 rebounds, and four blocks.</p>
<p align="left">	"Beating Southern Maine on their home court was awesome and pulling out the Emmanuel win was a relief but great nonetheless," said Pemper.  "Any NESCAC win is wonderful, but certainly getting the better of Bates and Colby is a high."  The team beat Bates 58-43 and Colby 60-43.</p>
<p align="left">With 17 games down, the team has by far exceeded its original expectations. "We don't ever have goals of going undefeated or working for national recognition," said Courtney Trotta '04, captain and guard.  "We just try to focus on playing hard and coming together to play well."</p>
<p align="left">"It's a great feeling to be able to work with 15 women who have the credibility, commitment, and desire to be apart of such a wonderful program," said Trenkle.  "We have some improvements to make in terms of our chemistry on the floor, but that is getting better day in and day out as we continue to foster a positive, loving environment."</p>
<p align="left">Pemper notes that the team's biggest challengers are consistently playing with confidence and realizing that there is always room for improvement.  "When you're winning, individuals can get a false sense of confidence," she said.  "When you have talent around you, it's easier to not go out on a limb and take risks or to put in the work to be your best."</p>
<p align="left">Trotta attributes the team's success to its unity and common mindset.  "I think that we all trust in each other and in our system, so everyone is on the same page.  It makes for a strong and fun team," she said.</p>
<p align="left">"Opponents admire how hard, smart, focused, and confident they play," said Pemper when explaining the team's accomplishments.  She accredits it to a high level of maturity.</p>
<p align="left">With only six games to go in regular season play, the team takes on Williams tonight at Williams.  "On the horizon are talented Williams, Middlebury, Tufts, and Farmington squads, so we have our work cut out for us," said Pemper.</p>
