        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG</font><font size="2"><br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">My first job was as a sales assistant at one of New York's 
        Doubleday bookshops, the one adjacent to Lord &amp; Taylor's on Fifth 
        Avenue. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though a notoriously underpaid occupation, I enjoyed selling 
        books and would eventually become a proper bookseller, first in Hamburg 
        and later London. <br>
        When applying at Foyle's, billed as 'the world's greatest bookshop,' but 
        rather more resembling a Dickensian sweatshop, I was interviewed by the 
        owner, the late Christina Foyle herself. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I see you worked at Doubleday's in New York,&quot; 
        she said, &quot;when do you want to start?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, after four weeks at my first job, I quit. Not because 
        I didn't like it, but because I'd been offered something better. They 
        were sorry to lose me. The branch manager said he'd give me a recommendation 
        anytime. Ten years later, at a critical time in my life, I was to take 
        him up on the offer. Keep tuning in so as not to miss this episode. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My second job was with A.K. Peters Company, an export/tmport 
        firm owned by a friend of Harry's named Arthur K. Peters. A one-man business, 
        it was operated with only the help of a secretary from a small office 
        on the 12th floor of a building on the corner of 42nd and Fifth, just 
        across from the Public Library. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Standing at the open window one day in the fall of '58, 
        we watched Fidel Castro riding by down below in an open car. He was on 
        his way from the United Nations to his hotel in Harlem, where the leader 
        of the Cuban Revolution and his entourage allegedly left chicken bones 
        behind strewn all over the carpet. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On another occasion, happening to stand at the curb on 42nd 
        Street, I saw Nikita Krushchev speeding past in a bullet-proof limousine. 
        The Soviet leader was attending a plenary session of the UN General Assembly, 
        during which he famously took off his shoe to pound the desk in protest 
        of critical remarks made about the Soviet Union.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The secretary at A.K. Peters Company, called Jane Prull, 
        wouldn't have tolerated such shenanigans. A no-nonsense type with authoritarian 
        manner, though nice enough if she wanted to be, A.K. and I, behind Jane's 
        back, called her 'Sergeant Prull'. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The 'Sarge' was to be good training for me considering developments 
        yet to come. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A.K. Peters imported fertilizer from South America plus 
        - perhaps to make up for the smell -aromatic essences from Grasse, Provence. 
        For the latter, A.K. held the exclusive franchise for the United States. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of my first jobs in the office was to sort out dozens 
        of tiny sample bottles kept in a dusty cupboard. Later however, making 
        better use of someone with a BA in English, AK had me draft business letters 
        that he would correct and sign before being sent off by 'Sergeant Prull'. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Being a native speaker of German came in handy in helping 
        promote a new product line imported from Germany. It was a chemical foam 
        used in fighting fires caused by explosions or inairplane emergency landings, 
        and was sold to oil refineries and airport authorities. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To make ours sound different from domestic brands we had 
        to give it a distinctive name. After much deliberation and a number of 
        suggestions laughingly dismissed, we came up with Schaumgeist, 'the champagne 
        of fire-fighting foams.'<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A.K. had such confidence in this product, and apparently 
        also me, that he sent me out on a sales tour on behalf of Schaumgeist 
        on this tour. I visited oil refineries in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, 
        a week's trip by hired car with all expenses paid. Without telling him, 
        I took Ronnie along. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not surprisingly, being a novice salesman with somewhat 
        diffident manner and slight accent, I didn't notch up a single sale. Still, 
        A.K. seemed pleased that our new product had been introduced to a lot 
        of potential customers, and orders eventually did come in. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Married with three children my boss lived in Bronxville. 
        Art's wife Sally was working on a master's degree in Art History, and 
        he, in his spare time, on a Ph.D. in French literature. Quite an amazing 
        couple. When not vacationing at their ranch in Jackson Hole, they'd be 
        off to London, Paris, or Rome to 'do research'. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though a dropout from academia, I continued to be interested 
        in literature. Among books I read at the time, strangely enough for someone 
        supposedly gay, were those of Henry Miller. And I went to the theatre, 
        Ron's great love too, that and the movies. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Among the plays we saw, appropriately on a sticky summer's 
        evening, was O'Neill's 'The Iceman Cometh,' an off-Broadway production. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Standing outside the theatre during intermission, I happened 
        to see a familiar figure, my Bowdoin English teacher Herby Brown, walking 
        up and down by himself, but didn't have the nerve to go up to him. College 
        already seemed a long time ago. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ron, on such occasions, would accuse me of being 'ashamed' 
        of him. <br>
        Perhaps I was. Not because Ron was black, but because he made terrible 
        scenes if feeling racially slighted. He claimed he'd inherited his terrible 
        temper from his paternal grandmother, part-Indian and 'slightly mad', 
        he said, like himself. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately Ron also had an inherited spinal defect eventually 
        necessitating major surgery, life-threatening the doctors told him, but, 
        thank God, a success. <br>
        After about nine months at AK Peters Company, I received a letter from 
        the US Government with the ominous opening, &quot;Greetings.&quot; Having 
        in the meantime acquired immigrant status, I was drafted. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Army would 'make a man' out of me, my paternal friend 
        the English Colonel somewhat optimistically thought. </p>
