      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: Can someone have genital herpes and not 
        know it? Could that person infect you with herpes, even if they never 
        had any sores? J.V.S.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear J.V.S.: Unfortunately, the answer is YES to both of 
        those questions. There is new concern in public health circles about rapid 
        spread of genital herpes, and you have underlined two of the main reasons 
        for that increase.<br>
        Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two 
        strains, type 1 and type 2. Type 1 causes nearly all oral herpes infections 
        (&quot;fever blisters&quot; or &quot;cold sores&quot;), and probably 40% 
        of genital herpes infections (transmitted by oral sex). Type 2 causes 
        about 60% of genital herpes infections and a very small number of oral 
        outbreaks. After the initial infection, the herpes virus lies dormant 
        in nerve bundles at the base of the spine, but periodically re-activates, 
        causing recurrent outbreaks. There is at present no cure or vaccine for 
        herpes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">About 80% of the population has, at some time, had oral 
        herpes, caused by HSV-1. The prevalence of genital herpes has increased 
        significantly over the last 20 years, with more than 20% of adolescents 
        and adults estimated to be infected in this country. In college student 
        populations, the prevalence may be even higher.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The &quot;classic&quot; signs of an initial genital herpes 
        infection are grouped blisters or sores in the genital area that itch 
        or burn or hurt and which are often accompanied by flu-like aches and 
        pains and low grade fever. Recurrent outbreaks are usually milder and 
        briefer and typically occur four to five times per year. They are frequently 
        triggered by other illnesses, poor diet, or emotional or physical stress. 
        Over time, recurrent outbreaks become even less frequent and less severe 
        and may eventually cease altogether.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is now becoming clear that most cases of genital herpes 
        do not present with these &quot;classic&quot; signs and symptoms. In fact, 
        up to 60% of infections are not recognized by patients or diagnosed by 
        clinicians, because they do not cause the typical sores. In addition, 
        up to 20% of infections are missed altogether because they cause no symptoms 
        whatsoever.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Transmission of herpes occurs most readily from skin-to-skin 
        contact with an actively, broken out site. The virus is very fragile and 
        does not live long on surfaces. Herpes cannot be transmitted via contact 
        with a toilet seat, bathtub, or towel. Most skin on our bodies is too 
        thick for the virus to penetrate, but mucosal surfaces (oral and genital) 
        are quite susceptible. Herpes virus can also be shed, and so transmitted, 
        when no signs or symptoms are present. </p>
      <p align="left">Fortunately, this asymptomatic shedding is thought to occur 
        only a few days per year. On the other hand, because most people naturally 
        tend to avoid sex when they have active sores, most transmission of herpes 
        (over 70%), occurs in the absence of warning signs or symptoms.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Herpes is diagnosed most reliably by culturing the virus 
        from active lesions. Diagnosis is more problematic in between outbreaks, 
        or in an asymptomatic carrier. Blood tests can be done to measure antibodies 
        to both viral types, but they are not always accurate. More reliable tests 
        are very expensive, and the most reliable tests are currently available 
        only in research settings. </p>
      <p align="left">Interpretation of test results can be difficult. For instance, 
        because nearly 80% of the population have have, at some time, had oral 
        herpes, nearly 80% of the population have antibodies to HSV-1, whether 
        or not HSV-1 is also the cause of a possible genital infection. Positive 
        HSV-2 antibody titers indicate that it is only likely that the individual 
        has had genital herpes, and even positive antibody titers to both HSV-1 
        and HSV-2 do not confirm that an individual has had both oral and genital 
        herpes. Neither HSV-1 nor HSV-2 is anatomically restricted.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many people who have been diagnosed with genital herpes 
        find it emotionally and psychologically distressing. Fortunately, for 
        most, this distress and anxiety fade with time. Genital herpes rarely 
        leads to other health problems, with two important exceptions. First, 
        it is thought that genital herpes increases both the sexual acquisition 
        and the sexual transmission of HIV and presumably plays a similar role 
        with Hepatitis B. Second, contracting genital herpes during the third 
        trimester of pregnancy risks potentially devastating transmission of HSV 
        to the baby. Still, to keep things in perspective, some 25% of pregnant 
        women are thought to have genital herpes, and very fortunately, fewer 
        than 0.1% of babies contract neonatal herpes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are currently three medications approved for treatment 
        of herpes. Each can be taken acutely to help speed the healing process 
        of outbreaks, and each can also be taken daily and long term to prevent 
        recurrences. It is not yet clear if daily medication also prevents asymptomatic 
        viral shedding.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Efforts to decrease transmission of herpes through safer 
        sex practices remain key. Avoiding intimate contact when sores are present 
        is essential. In between outbreaks, using condoms, dental dams, or female 
        condoms significantly lowers the risk of viral transmission. Of course, 
        no safer sex practice can eliminate all infectious risks. But being informed 
        about those risks, and negotiating the level of risk acceptable to both 
        people in a relationship, are critical first steps. As &quot;Alice,&quot; 
        from Columbia University's Health Education Program website has put it, 
        &quot;Just as falling in love takes some courage and trust, so does choosing 
        to be sexual with someone. There is always a risk of 'catching something.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Be well, and be safe! <br>
