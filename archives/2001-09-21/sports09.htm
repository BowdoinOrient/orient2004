      <p>In soccer, within a loss to a quality squad, there hides a lesson to 
        be learned. The Bowdoin Men's Soccer Team certainly isn't dwelling on 
        its problems, nor did it let a hard-fought defeat at the hands of Williams 
        keep it down. The men rebounded Wednesday, pummeling the University of 
        New England's Nor'easters by a score of 7-0. The soccer team now stands 
        with a record of 3-1, 1-1 in the NESCAC.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Before this rebound could occur, however, our boys had to endure a relatively 
        harsh beating from the Ephs last Saturday. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Williams' Alex Blake pushed a shot past sophomore goaltender Travis Derr 
        with only 1:20 elapsed in the game. He and Josef Powell would go on to 
        score two goals apiece in the first half.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Back on the field after a halftime rest, Eph Khari Stevenson found the 
        back of Bowdoin's net, pushing the Williams lead to an overwhelming 5-0.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't a complete washout, however. First year Thomas Bresnehan prevented 
        a Williams shutout, scoring off an assist from Bucky Jencks '05. <br>
        The weekend's lesson was clear: in order to regain some pride and self-confidence, 
        the men couldn't dwell on their loss to Williams' quality squad. This 
        moral was quite evident in the Polar Bears' rejuvinated play on Wednesday 
        against the University of New England. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears' effort against UNE was not unlike a bullfight-everyone knows 
        how it will end, and it sure ain't pretty along the way. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While David Bulow '02 started off the scoring with his fourth goal of 
        the season, it was Chris Fuller '03 who stole the show. Fuller made a 
        statement on the field that appeared to say, &quot;Anything you can do, 
        I can do better&quot; to Bulow. He beat UNE keeper Nate Montminy twice 
        in just under four minutes, padding the Polar Bear lead at 3-0. <br>

        </tr>

          <td><font size="2">Danny Sullivan '05 looks to dribble past any Williams

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Not to be outdone, Bulow countered with another goal of his own, making 
        the score 4-0 for Bowdoin and knotting the Fuller-Bulow goals race at 
        two apiece. <br>
        In the second half, it was more of the same. Sophomore Jordan McQuillan 
        got a late start in the &quot;Who Can Score the Most Goals?&quot; competition, 
        but quickly added a goal of his own.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Fuller's two subsequent goals pushed the Bear bulge to a final score 
        of 7-0. Sophomore Travis Derr finished with two saves in the shutout. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some may criticize a dominant team for running up a game's score, or 
        a player for taking too many shots. We've all been there, seeing one team 
        take a pounding from another to the point that it is painful to watch.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But to these people I say, &quot;This isn't junior high anymore!&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>When looking at the big picture, yesterday's UNE match was more than 
        a one-sided domination of a weak team. It gave our boys a chance to get 
        back on the pitch, move past last Saturday's painful match against Williams, 
        and get oriented towards the task of taking on Middlebury tomorrow.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team did just that. They could have dwelt on the loss, or looked 
        past UNE to Middlebury and gotten caught unaware.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Instead, they pulled together as a team, put forth a solid effort, and 
        now are laying in wait for the Panthers. And we all know that next to 
        penguins, panthers are a polar bear's favorite food. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I have one piece of inspiration for our men's soccer team; the words 
        of a teammate before an intramural game. When asked if he would have any 
        trouble playing against Baxter, his former social house, he issued a statement 
        that clearly applies to the boys' play tomorrow against Middlebury: &quot;After 
        the game, our cleats will be dripping with blood,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Go out there and draw some blood, boys. GO U BEARS!<br>
