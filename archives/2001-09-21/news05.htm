      <p align="left"><font size="5">Despite economy, Bowdoin alumni thrive<br>
        <font size="2">SOPHIA BASSAN</font><font size="2"><br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Anne Shields, Director of the Career Planning Center (CPC), 
        wants to reassure Bowdoin students: post-graduation employment is not 
        a &quot;doom and gloom&quot; scenario. As a matter of fact, it looks more 
        than decent.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">If one were to browse statistics of the class of 2000, one 
        would see Asian studies, economics, and history majors alike working as 
        high-paid analysts at leading investment-banks. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Granted, 173 members or 43.5 percent of the class were seeking 
        employment at the time of graduation. However, that number dwindled to 
        2 percent within less than a year. By then, 80 percent were employed, 
        15 percent in were graduate school, and 3 percent were traveling.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the fall 2001 salary survey conducted by the 
        National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), many disciplines 
        within the liberal arts saw an increase in salary since 2000. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Starting salaries for English major graduates rose by 6.5 
        percent to an average of $30,014. For sociology majors, they rose by 6 
        percent to an average of $29, 571, and for psychology majors, they rose 
        by 4 percent to an average of $29, 952.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shields said not to panic about statistics quoted by the 
        national media that college hiring is expected to drop severely. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most of these statistics also come from the NACE. However, 
        the employers represented by NACE, she explained, are disproportionately 
        comprised of engineering, high tech, and &quot;Big Business&quot; firms 
        such as Ford, General Motors, and Proctor &amp; Gamble. Among them is 
        Motorola, which probably hires 4,500 new graduates-nearly all engineers-per 
        year. Thus, Bowdoin College graduates will not be directly affected by 
        Motorola's employment practices. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In general, many of the companies represented by NACE do 
        not hire Bowdoin graduates to begin with.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Whether the economy heads into a full-fledged recession 
        or not, many industries will still be hiring. The College, Shields gave 
        as an example, will not be employing less people overall, though they 
        may not hire as many if employees stay longer than previously anticipated. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Furthermore, many companies that took heavy human losses 
        during last week's attack will need to employ new people. Shields reminds 
        students that they are still in the top ten percent of their high school 
        classes and thus more competitive than roughly 90 percent of their peers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She pointed out, though, that a tighter job market &quot;does 
        mean it's going to be harder to find employment. You may have to work 
        longer and harder. And in some fields, jobs will be fewer.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most employers are still coming to recruit on-schedule. 
        She admitted, &quot;We [the CPC] have had some employers who won't be 
        coming to campus physically.&quot; Resum&eacute; referrals, interviews 
        onsite rather than on-campus, will be available instead. Also, recruiting 
        events in Boston and New York City are still taking place as planned. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shields said it is still too early know if an increase in 
        graduate school applications will occur. According to CPC statistics, 
        the number of Bowdoin students attending graduate school upon graduation 
        decreased from 20 people in the class of 1996 to 9 in the class of 2000.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lisa Tessler, Director of the newly formed Alumni Career 
        Programs (ACP) and former Director of the CPC for ten years, possessed 
        more current information about interest in graduate school. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">ACP, founded in August 2000, is an innovative effort to 
        provide career-counseling services to alumni, especially those who have 
        graduated within the last five years. Tessler helps those who want to 
        switch jobs, are out of work, or are contemplating graduate school.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The number of alumni contacting her for counseling has at 
        least doubled in the past year. She cannot be sure if this increase in 
        phone calls and e-mails is due to the economy or because the service is 
        better known or both. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So far, only a small number of students from last year's 
        class have contacted her, perhaps five in the last month. Judging from 
        calls she has received, though, Tessler predicts &quot;heightened interest 
        in graduate school.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tessler also continues to hear from alumni who want to help 
        graduates and current students alike. Many alumni call with job openings 
        that Tessler then puts onto a database accessible through Polar Net. Over 
        1,450 alumni volunteers from all over the country are also involved in 
        the Bowdoin Career Advisory Network (BCAN), accessible through Polar Net, 
        too. With its mission to &quot;share their time and expertise with students 
        and recent graduates&quot;, BCAN has been in existence for over 15 years. 
        Tessler is continually looking to expand this networking operation and 
        site. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tessler has also planned 12 career-networking receptions 
        specifically for alumni with other networking events in New York City, 
        Boston, and possibly Washington, D.C. for current students. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Networking may well be among a student's most powerful assets 
        in seeking employment. For the class of 2000, according to Shields, over 
        half of those employed upon graduation had obtained their position through 
        networking and other such contacts. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Additionally, Tessler has various site visits planned for 
        students. For example, on Tuesday, October 9, there will be a site visit 
        to LL Bean. Attendees will meet the company's Senior Vice President and 
        General Manager and learn about business management from him. She encourages 
        those interested to sign up for this unique educational opportunity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More immediately, the ACP and CPC have an educational panel, 
        &quot;Beyond Bowdoin&quot;, planned for Friday, September 28, to be held 
        in Moulton Union. Twenty-two alumni will be at the panel to give students 
        advice on how best to look for and apply to jobs. Tessler strongly urges 
        students to attend the Beyond Bowdoin forum. Brochures for it will be 
        in mailboxes Monday.</p>
