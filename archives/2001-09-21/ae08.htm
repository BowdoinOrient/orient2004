      <p align="left">For Bowdoin students in 2001, it seems almost impossible 
        to fathom that just thirty years ago, this campus was suffering from a 
        serious shortage of estrogen. In 1971, Bowdoin matriculated its first 
        ever coed class, a tremendous step for the college and a fortuitous one 
        for the females among us. <br>

          <td><font size="2">The Women Rock concert last Saturday celebrated thirty 
            years of women at Bowdoin. The lineup consisted of Antigone Rising, 
            Diedre McCalla, and Melissa Ferrick. (Henry Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p align="left">This past weekend, the Women Rock concert marked the celebration 
        of this momentous event, and was sponsored by the Campus Activities Board, 
        the Bowdoin Women's Association, and the Women's Resource Center. The 
        collaboration of these three groups made it possible for three superbly 
        talented female acts to grace the quad on Saturday, which drew a surprisingly 
        diverse crowd from the Bowdoin community and Brunswick.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Deidre McCalla, Melissa Ferrick, and Antigone Rising shared 
        their musical styles--ranging from folk to indie rock to Freddie Mercury 
        for good measure--with concertgoers on Saturday. McCalla's rich, earthy 
        voice was perfectly suited to the new brand of folk (equal parts Joan 
        Baez and James Taylor) she brought to the stage, and her set represented 
        an equally amazing array of themes, from childhood and abandonment to 
        a song about her deep-seated mistrust of cats.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of the three performers, Melissa Ferrick was the most high-profile. 
        Among folk-rock circles, she is praised for her innovative musical talent, 
        and is becoming more widely known as word of her ability spreads. While 
        often compared to folk-rock goddess Ani DiFranco (and I'll admit, they 
        do sound a lot alike), Ferrick combines her utterly unique voice, skillful 
        guitar work and intriguing drum solos in such a way as to distinguish 
        her completely as an individual musician with a soulful, yet fresh sound. 
        Although her performance was plagued with distracting technical difficulties, 
        she eventually rallied and delivered a solid set, which spanned much of 
        her current repertoire. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A hard-rocking finale was in store with Antigone Rising, 
        a five piece all-female band with amazing energy and verve, and the talent 
        to match. Led by their bombshell-blonde frontwoman Cassidy, Antigone Rising 
        has been gaining a reputation as a serious rock band that can put on a 
        killer show, and was featured by Steppin' Out magazine. As a female rock 
        tribute to an old Queen favorite, the group finished off their set with 
        a fabulous cover of &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls.&quot; If that's not rock 
        and roll to the core, I don't know what is.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The concert attracted music lovers of all kinds, both from 
        Bowdoin and beyond. While upcoming concerts such as Everclear will likely 
        bring crowds from all over the area, it was encouraging to see so many 
        people appreciate the talents of such gifted female performers as well. 
        The event itself was an excellent opportunity for the campus, as well 
        as the Brunswick community, to come out in support of female artists and 
        celebrate the vibrant tradition of women at Bowdoin. <br>
