      <p>As the Bowdoin Football Team takes the field tomorrow against Middlebury, 
        many random thoughts will float through the players' minds: plays and 
        assignments, key Middlebury opponents, and the nerves of opening day.<br>
        For the seniors, it will be the last opening day, when the crowd's excitement 
        is at its peak and a clean slate hasn't been tarnished with losses or 
        missed opportunities. Bowdoin football has defined the fall season of 
        many graduating players, and tomorrow's game will mark the beginning of 
        the end.<br>

      <p>&quot;It's the opening game of our final season. We all want to start 
        off on a good note, because none of us will ever play again,&quot; said 
        senior Chris Sakelakos. &quot;We've worked hard and deserve to win.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>For these men, it's a new season, with new goals. The Bears are confident 
        that they can erase last year's disappointments, even after taking an 
        early non-season loss to Williams last Saturday.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to senior Travis Cummings, last weekend's scrimmage revealed 
        the Polar Bears' need to eliminate simple mistakes in order to have a 
        fighting chance tomorrow. &quot;We need to take another step forward as 
        a team to play well against Middlebury,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bears will rely on starting quarterback Justin Hardinson '03 and 
        the strength of their offensive line. Victory seems to be an important 
        goal for the players, but not the end-all. &quot;I'm not worried about 
        our team morale, because our players have a lot of character and confidence,&quot; 
        Cummings said. &quot;We haven't really thought about losing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In order to earn this victory, the Polar Bears have to hurdle a rather 
        daunting opponent. Middlebury handed Bowdoin a 28-14 loss in last season's 
        opening matchup, and went on to win six of its next seven. A 28-21 defeat 
        at the hands of Colby's White Mules was the only black spot in the Panthers' 
        2000 campaign, which concluded with a 7-1 record.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite losing some key players to graduation, Midd's defensive scheme 
        is still in place, with a multiple seven-man front and four-man secondary. 
        The Bears are looking to force Panther mistakes while executing Head Coach 
        Dave Caputi's game plan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Aside from preparation, the team also is looking forward to the pure 
        fun of the upcoming game. &quot;There's nothing better than playing a 
        football game on Whittier Field, next to the pine trees, a grandstand 
        that has been there for almost a hundred years, and the overwhelming smell 
        of barbeque from the tailgaters,&quot; said Cummings. &quot;Everybody 
        is excited, and I can't wait for our first years to experience their first 
        home game here.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>For the Polar Bears, these will be just a few of the images flooding 
        their minds as the players take the first step onto Whittier tomorrow 
        at 1:30 PM. Come watch them take a shot at those Panthers and Bowdoin's 
        112-year-old history book.<br>
