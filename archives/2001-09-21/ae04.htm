      <p align="left"> It's no accident that the Bowdoin Outing Club is the largest 
        student organization on campus. Bowdoin has a long tradition of involvement 
        with and exploration of the natural world, and one of the College's most 
        notable alumni in that field was Donald B. MacMillan, an Arctic explorer 
        often paired in name with another Bowdoin explorer, Robert E. Peary (hence 
        the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum housed in Hubbard Hall at the head of 
        Bowdoin's quad). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Currently, the museum is exhibiting a collection of MacMillan's 
        photographs, entitled &quot;Four Years in the White North: Donald B. MacMillan's 
        Crocker Land Lecture.&quot; The exhibit, in the foyer of Hubbard Hall, 
        consists of original prints from the over 5,000 photographs that MacMillan 
        took during his trip to explore the then-uncharted territory of Crocker 
        Land in the northwest Arctic. </p>
      <p align="left">A small portion of these were transferred from the original 
        hand-tinted glass lantern slides to prints for the display, and was made 
        possible by a New Century Preservation Grant from the State of Maine. 
        This exhibit illustrates a long established relationship with the region. 
        Said Museum Curator Dr. Genevieve LeMoine, &quot;Bowdoin has a very strong 
        connection with the Arctic.&quot; <br>
        Robert Peary chronicled his experience with photography during his Arctic 
        exploration: <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;My photographic equipment I considered among the most 
        important. A previous experience in the Arctic regions had shown me not 
        only that the popular conceptions of life and work in those regions was 
        entirely erroneous, but that mere pen and ink descriptions failed utterly 
        to convey an idea of the splendor and grandeur of the most savage, the 
        most fascinating portion of the earth's surface.&quot; And right he was, 
        in more ways than he chose to list. Not only did his photographs capture 
        the pristine beauty of the Arctic, they also served to capture the imaginations 
        of potential financial backers and helped secure the explorer's legacy. 
        MacMillan toured the country with his slides and discussed each briefly 
        with an adoring public. While the technology of the day made expedition 
        photography both challenging and cumbersome in the harsh Arctic environment, 
        it proved well worth the difficulty. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;One exciting thing about the exhibit is that the texts 
        [captions] are taken directly from MacMillan's lectures,&quot; said LeMoine. 
        &quot;What he had to say about these is probably very different than what 
        we might say about them today.&quot; <br>
        The prints are intriguing both as examples of early color photography 
        as well as windows to the Arctic of MacMillan's day. It was a &quot;silent 
        place, unworn of man,&quot; the sort of area that former president Theodore 
        Roosevelt was so devoted to protecting. Even now, nearly ninety years 
        after MacMillan's expedition, the Arctic is still very present in our 
        national consciousness, as evidenced by the controversy over the proposed 
        drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Four Years in the White North: Donald B. MacMillan's 
        Crocker Land Lecture&quot; opens and closes with Hubbard Hall, 9-5 during 
        the week, 10-5 on Saturday, and 2-5 on Sunday, and will run through December.
