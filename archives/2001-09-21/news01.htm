            Gym. In addition to a substantial number of students, residents of 
            Brunswick and elsewhere lined up to donate blood to the victims of 
            last week's terrorist attack. (Henry Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p align="left">In the week following terrorist attacks in New York and 
        Washington, the entire Bowdoin community offered assistance to those who 
        were personally affected by the attacks, and created a supportive environment 
        to help the entire campus cope with the tragedy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Immediately following the event, some professors decided 
        that they felt uncomfortable holding class. &quot;I decided that I didn't 
        want to have class that day,&quot; said Professor of Russian Jane Knox-Voina. 
        &quot;I thought it would be better for my students to be with who they 
        wanted.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">She recalled, &quot;I remembered how I felt the day JFK 
        was shot, all of the sadness and confusion, and I thought 'How do you 
        remove the pain?' I think students are feeling that same shift in identity 
        that I felt.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Other professors used class as an opportunity to inform 
        themselves and their students of the developing situation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor of Sociology Susan Bell was originally scheduled 
        to have a class early Tuesday morning; however, she decided to relocate 
        her class to Russwurm House when she heard of the news, where they were 
        able to watch the unfolding events on television.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;What people needed was information, and I couldn't 
        provide it myself. I originally planned to bring a radio into class, but 
        then I decided that students didn't want to listen to the radio, they 
        wanted to see it live,&quot; she explained.<br>
        In another class, Bell allowed the students to determine how they wanted 
        to respond to the day's unfolding events. They decided to use the poems 
        they were assigned to read that day as a way of expressing their thoughts 
        and feelings. &quot;I wanted to speak to the needs of the students, and 
        I felt like I could do that best through the material we had been studying,&quot; 
        said Bell. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Upon hearing of the attacks, the Residential Life staff 
        had an emergency meeting on Tuesday morning to figure out how to best 
        handle the situation. The staff created a list of those students who lived 
        within the New York City and Washington areas, and spent the day working 
        with the deans to contact each student and to offer support to those who 
        may have been immediately affected by the tragedy. Alumni Relations also 
        created a similar list of alums to determine their safety.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sarah Manz '03, Head Proctor in Winthrop said, &quot;One 
        of my first priorities became checking in with each of my residents. I 
        tried to find and speak with everyone in my proctor group and building 
        and assure that they knew where to find TVs, where to find counseling, 
        where people were gathering, and where to turn for support.&quot; She 
        also expressed concern for first years who &quot;are living away from 
        home for the first time and dealing with such a major tragedy.&quot;<br>
        Many RAs also went door-to-door to check on each student and help to cope 
        with the situation at hand. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'm only one person on staff, and between the 54 student 
        staff members, there were 54 different approaches, priorities, and experiences,&quot; 
        stated Manz. &quot;It struck me that throughout this past week, nobody 
        was afraid to step up, and everyone took responsibility for the people 
        they cared about. Because of that responsibility, there were no cracks 
        for people to slip through.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Keeping myself together and grasping the magnitude 
        and implications of the events as they unfolded was extremely challenging 
        at times. Knowing that throughout the campus there were so many people 
        reaching out and coming together brought me both strength and comfort,&quot; 
        said Manz.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the afternoon of the attacks, campus forums were organized 
        as places where students and faculty could come together and share their 
        feelings to support each other. Vigils were also held to honor those who 
        were feared dead or missing in the attacks.<br>

      <p align="left">The College has also been active in implementing relief 
        programs, including a blood drive sponsored by the American Red Cross. 
        In one day, over 350 students and staff members signed up to donate their 
        blood, and on Wednesday the Blood Drive shut down early after being overwhelmed 
        by donors.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In addition, the College invited religious leaders of various 
        faiths to be available for students and faculty, both in the Brunswick 
        area and in Portland.<br>
        The College also set up a Salvation Army donation box in Smith Union, 
        for donations to be sent to those in need in New York and Washington.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was amazing,&quot; said Coordinator of Student 
        Community Service Programs Lydia Bell. &quot;Boxes of granola, dozens 
        of bottles of water and Gatorade, flashlights, T-shirts, leather gloves, 
        batteries, and nail brushes were all donated by the Bowdoin community. 
        The minute the attacks happened, everyone mobilized to provide counseling 
        and religious services to the community, to help everyone cope,&quot; 
        said Bell. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On Thursday night, students met with faculty members from 
        the Departments of Government, Religion, History, and Anthropology in 
        Pickard Theater, in an attempt to provide a political, religious, and 
        social context for understanding the tragic events.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The efforts are paying off. &quot;I am especially thankful 
        for how fortunate this community has been as a whole and for the effort 
        each individual has put into taking care of those nearest them here,&quot; 
        said Manz. <br>
