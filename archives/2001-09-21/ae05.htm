      <p align="left"><font size="5">Shakespeare's <i>Othello</i> told as modern 
        film, <i>O</i><br>
        <font size="2">HANNAH TUCKER<br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p> Before Julia Stiles pirouetted her way to box office stardom in Save 
        the Last Dance, and long before you knew who Josh Hartnett was, the two 
        actors made a little movie called O. The film was completed in 1998, but 
        became so shrouded in controversy due to its school-violence content that 
        everyone short of Joe Lieberman himself insisted on the film's indefinite 
        shelving.<br>
      </p>
      <p>O is a retelling of Shakespeare's Othello, complete with modern dialogue 
        and a hip-hop dominated soundtrack. The film stars Mekhi Phifer as Othello 
        (here named Odin James, Palmetto Grove Academy's basketball star), who 
        is convinced by scheming Hugo (Hartnett) that his girlfriend Desi (Stiles) 
        is cheating on him. As in all Shakespeare tragedies, the conclusion includes 
        the inevitable chaos and corpses. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The hype surrounding O's release did it a great disservice; the film 
        doesn't live up to its reputation or its potential. Brad Kaaya's screenplay 
        simply substitutes slang for iambs without bothering to modernize the 
        playwright's archaic plot devices. One glaring exception is the film's 
        digression into a cocaine subplot, which is used to explain Odin's murderous 
        temper. The technique feels hollow, and robs Phifer of a chance to explore 
        the behavior of a truly complicated character. O also highlights the loss 
        of nuance in Harnett's unimpressive facial expressions, and the failure 
        of Andrew Keegan (who plays the hunky pawn Michael) in proving he can 
        act better than a tube of hair gel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>O is unsure what to do with its uneven racial themes: curiously making 
        Odin the only African-American at the film's Southern boarding school 
        encourages the viewer to focus on this detail while the Palmetto Grove 
        student body appears to scarcely take notice. It doesn't help that the 
        only other African-American character with a speaking role is a drug dealer. 
        In general, the film is far more concerned with reaching its calamitous 
        climax than developing thematically. <br>
        Still, O is worth seeing. Efficient and trim at 93 minutes, Tim Blake 
        Nelson's direction is fast-paced without resorting to cinematic MTV syndrome. 
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, O rivals 2000's X-Men for the savviest use of a title letter. 
        Unmistakable are Nelson's clever angles that emphasize the spherical visages 
        of basketball hoops, rotundas, and a multitude of other images. Phifer 
        delivers a jaw-clenching, emotive performance, which simultaneously exudes 
        vulnerability and animal determination. Stiles (Hollywood's resident Shakespeare-remake 
        chick) makes unbelievably clueless Desi likeable, her cherubic mouth never 
        failing to, whether in agony or ecstasy, form the most perfect of the 
        film's &quot;O'&quot;s. Rain Phoenix is refreshingly calculated in her 
        portrayal of Desi's assertive but guarded roommate, Emily. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To be sure, O is provocative, but its edginess has nothing to do with 
        interracial romance. O is disturbing, but not because of its gun-related 
        violence. This is a film cheated out of artistic acclaim by unnecessary 
        caution. Its temerity has been blown out of proportion; the fact that 
        this is a sincerely entertaining movie is under-appreciated. The diction 
        of and implications in O are hardly groundbreaking, but the spirited dialogue 
        it facilitates is a welcome change.</p>
