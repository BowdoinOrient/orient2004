      <p align="left">This summer, while most students at Bowdoin spent their 
        vacation across the country, enjoying the homey atmosphere, going south, 
        heading to beaches, or mountains, nine sophomores of Bowdoin had a wonderful 
        chance to spent a summer month together in China for an intensive study 
        program led by Professor Nancy Riley, Associate Professor and Chair of 
        the Sociology and Anthropology Department. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left">

          <td><img src="images/features01_wall.jpg" width="300" height="248"></td>

          <td><font size="2">Bowdoin students on the Great Wall of China.</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Starting in spring 2001, Prof. Riley selected nine outstanding 
        sophomores from a pool of applicants to attend her intensive sociology 
        course on contemporary Chinese society. During the whole semester, Colin 
        Thibade, Sydney Asbury, Hannah Curtis, Erica Bellamy, Mara Caruso, Andrew 
        Dunn, Abbie Klein, Matt Norcia and Emilie Schlegel worked with professor 
        Riley not only on studying academically the issues of current Chinese 
        society, but also on preparing mentally for a trip to China at the end 
        of the course. Two days after the final, with Professor Riley, they went 
        out of New York City on a 14 hour-flight to Beijing, China, launching 
        an exciting month of study and travel in Southeast Asia.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The group traveled to five main cities: Dalian, Beijing, 
        Shanghai, Shanxi, and Kunming. During this time, the students continued 
        their study with reading assignments given by professor Riley on Chinese 
        social structures and their problems. They also held regular classes to 
        bring up discussions and book reports under the professor's instructions. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Their main intellectual gains, however, occurred out on 
        the streets, where they had direct contact with Chinese people and real 
        opportunities to observe their lifestyles and behaviors. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As part of their course requirement, the students made significant 
        efforts to learn about the modern Chinese culture from daily observations 
        and sometimes conversations with Chinese people, despite the language 
        barrier (all but one spoke fluent Chinese; the others only took a required 
        basic Chinese course in spring). Some interesting projects that they adopted 
        include studying political implications in dressing styles, the growing 
        popularity of Caucasian images in advertisements, environment preservations 
        in the streets of China, etc. These observations were also shared among 
        the group at every class meeting. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All these direct experiences with Chinese people and culture 
        brought invaluable insights into their perception of China. Although they 
        had spent time learning as comprehensively as possible about this country 
        at Bowdoin, the knowledge gained from trip was still extremely refreshing 
        and eye-opening. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Travel broadens the mind. To these students, being exposed 
        to new culture, having opportunities to reflect on the knowledge learned 
        with the real-life experiences, and being able to travel with each other 
        to many different places are just few of the privileges they were grateful 
        for. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As one of them confided, living in many neighborhoods less 
        prestigious, in economic as well as educational resources, helped them 
        fully realized how valuable are the opportunities they have at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Equally important were the close bonds among the group and 
        the strengthened professor-student relationships. &quot;By the end of 
        the trip, I had extremely high respect for the solid discipline that these 
        students demonstrated. This is an amazing group,&quot; remarked Professor 
        Riley about her students. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor Riley has spent a great deal of time in different 
        countries in Asia. Guiding the trip this time to China, she hoped not 
        only to give them a chance to gain hands-on experiences of what they have 
        studied at Bowdoin, but also to broaden their view of the world outside 
        Bowdoin, outside the country. The trip, as she described, was a great 
        success in its both goals. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Now that they've known of &quot;another place&quot; 
        that is completely different from where they've been previously exposed 
        to, the new awareness they gained made them think and act much differently 
        in many situations. Their mindsets also changed enormously, which I found 
        to be the most successful and rewarding thing about the trip,&quot; Riley 
        said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Coming back to Bowdoin at the end of summer, these students 
        have brought back a lot of exciting experiences to share with other Bowdoin 
        peers, stimulating more students to break away from the Bowdoin bubble 
        and explore other parts of the world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This trip to China was sponsored by the Freeman Foundation-one 
        dynamic organization who has been providing numerous fellowships for Bowdoin 
        students who are interested in doing research in Asia. With the approval 
        of the Sociology and Anthropology Department, Professor Riley, who filed 
        direct applications to the Freeman Foundation, will organize another trip 
        this year with the same format and timing. </p>
