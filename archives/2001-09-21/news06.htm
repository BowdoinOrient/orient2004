      <p align="left">Bowdoin's picturesque campus is one that's alive with energy 
        and movement&#133;and on many a busy day, with heavy traffic. Though many 
        of Bowdoin's resources seem limitless and ever expanding, one aspect of 
        the campus is limited in its capacity-parking. That's where Bowdoin Security 
        steps in, to manage this limitation as well as possible. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left">

          <td><font size="2">First years park in this lot on Stanwood Street, 
            the farthest lot from campus. Although Security is often associated 
            with parking woes, the staff insist that they do not enjoy ticketing 
            and towing students' cars. (File photo, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      </table>
      <p align="left">An integral part of the regulation of Bowdoin parking lies 
        in establishing a straightforward set of rules and enacting a method of 
        enforcing these rules in the name of order.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As it stands now, the first parking offense receives a warning, 
        the second a $25 ticket, and the third results in the towing of the vehicle.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Security utilizes a highly sophisticated software program, 
        the Parking Office Management System (POMS) to document all parking violations 
        and save them to students' accounts, which are opened upon the registry 
        of a vehicle. This program also has the ability to plot a wide range of 
        statistical information concerning Bowdoin parking. (i.e. what percentage 
        of registered vehicles hail from each state)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though POMS intricately documents all actions taken by students, 
        it does offer leniency for past grievous offenses; warnings and tickets 
        are only kept on file for one academic year (after which they are archived). 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rich Yanok, Parking Officer of Security, said &quot;Students 
        start with a fresh slate every September.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He continued, &quot;We're here to work with people.&quot; 
        These comments come in response to those who say that Security is only 
        out to reprimand students. In truth, no Security parking officers enjoy 
        towing vehicles or giving $50 of tickets. These measures are taken to 
        ensure that the parking system continues running efficiently.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Yanok pointed out, this course of action has met with 
        great success as this semester has ushered in &quot;a greater compliance&quot; 
        from students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This fall has been marked by what Yanok calls a change in 
        attitude from those he'd encountered over the previous 19 years he's served 
        the Bowdoin community. Students began this year with a reduced rate of 
        parking violations. <br>
        &quot;We are encouraged by this trend of compliance and hope that it will 
        continue,&quot; said Yanok. The job that Security does is an arduous one 
        and all too often a thankless one. As Yanok pointed out, Security is dedicated 
        to working with students for the convenience and safety of all.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He brings to light the importance that the lines of communication 
        between students and Security remain open. Often, the only interaction 
        between the two groups comes with the dispute of a ticket.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yanok hopes that students will feel comfortable calling 
        up or e-mailing him whenever circumstances arise which make sticking by 
        the parking regulations difficult.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We are willing to make provisions for certain circumstances 
        and hope that students will communicate with us before rules are needfully 
        broken.&quot; Officers are in some cases willing to make exceptions to 
        accommodate special cases.<br>
