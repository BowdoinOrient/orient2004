      <p align="left">Our lives changed on September 11. Forever. With the collapse 
        of two beacons of the free world and the penetration of an impregnable 
        Pentagon, the essence of our nation was rocked to its foundation. Millions 
        of Americans held candles in their hands, the stars and stripes sailed 
        over our terrorized country, and with patriotism and anguish, our nation 
        began to piece together the incomprehensible. President Bush choked up 
        on television, threats were issued to the faceless terrorists, and millions 
        of Americans were left to make sense of the unimaginable. The Bowdoin 
        Bubble burst, and without our notice, or maybe our understanding, a responsibility 
        fell upon us.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I sit writing this article more than one week after the 
        attack. The initial shock has lessened, disbelief turned into belief, 
        and the unknown a little more known. The panic and the frenzy, of a nation 
        turned upside down seems to have quieted a bit. It has taken me a good 
        week to even begin to make sense of it all, to try and place it into some 
        sort of comprehensible thought in my mind. I still read the news every 
        chance I get, and stop at every TV screen, waiting and wondering what 
        the answers will be; what the U.S. will do. These are questions that I 
        know won't be answered anytime soon, yet I can't help but sit and attempt 
        to piece together the answers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I have done a lot of thinking and wondering in the past 
        week has turned into self-reflection. I've spent so much time critiquing 
        and asking myself what I'm really doing with my life. For if everything 
        seems uncertain at this point, only one thing is obvious: Our generation 
        has received an enormous responsibility. And whether we choose to acknowledge 
        this or not, we are the next generation waiting in line to lead this country. 
        I realize what began on September 11 will not end in the near future. 
        It will be a long, drawn-out struggle between freedom and terrorism. We 
        will be the ones to continue that struggle, to be at the forefront of 
        national and international relations in the years to come, to be at the 
        leading edge of world peace. That has to make you wonder about what direction 
        your life is aimed, or where it should be heading.<br>
        So many people on this planet want world peace; they would do anything 
        in their power to attain such a goal. To some, this goal is idealistic. 
        To others, it's realistic. But no matter which way you view it, the goal 
        is a common one. Unfortunately, so many people in this world do not have 
        the ability to begin to confront that issue. Their social status inhibits 
        the agency they need to achieve such a thing: to be the person that dedicates 
        their life to furthering the peace of others and future generations to 
        come. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We are all very lucky to be at Bowdoin. We possess something 
        that so many people worldwide do not; an education. It is an education 
        that will give us the tools to do whatever it is we choose. It will give 
        us the agency to be the leaders in a world torn by terrorism, to be the 
        ones in our generation to build an international community founded on 
        peace. It would be an outright shame if each one of us did not utilize 
        an education wrought with so many benefits to further peace worldwide.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Forget selfishness, forget your self-centered career, because 
        when the world trade centers collapsed and the Pentagon was breached, 
        a world of responsibility landed on each of our shoulders. We have the 
        tools to do something constructive with our lives, to help, even in the 
        slightest manner, all of the international community. It is time for us 
        to realize the greater endeavor that all of our lives will be apart. We 
        will be the faces of world peace in the years to come, and Bowdoin will 
        provide us with the tools to do so. The U.S. Naval Academy ranks colleges 
        in the U.S. that have produced world leaders. Bowdoin was ranked number 
        eight out of 3,000 colleges. Let's not put this opportunity to waste.</p>
