      <p align="left">This fall, while the rest of the Bowdoin campus has been 
        adjusting to the strains of being back in school, the Student Executive 
        Board (SEB) has been preparing for another year of student government. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <table width="300" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/news04_studgovt.jpg" width="300" height="178"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><font size="2">The Student Executive Board (SEB). (Kate Lackemann, 
            <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>) </font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The SEB is one of two branches of Bowdoin's student government 
        and consists of nine students. According to the Bowdoin website, the Student 
        Executive Board is &quot;charged with handling policy issues of the student 
        body as well as issues that require fast action.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the SEB heads into the new year, its biggest priority, 
        in conjunction with the rest of the student government, is reaching the 
        student body. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The head of the SEB, Meghan MacNeil '03 explained, &quot;[Our] 
        biggest goal is to make student government into a resource for students 
        to get what they want done.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to achieve this goal, Meghan emphasized that the 
        SEB is in the process of implementing some reforms to help the student 
        body become more connected with the student government. She cited last 
        year's passage of Student Matters as a particular force to empower students' 
        participation in government (Student Matters is a program that allows 
        students to propose a bill in front of the Student Congress). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although the overarching theme for student government may 
        be finding a way to better reach the students, a large part of their work 
        involves specific initiatives. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to firm up their plans for this year's student 
        government, the student government will be taking its annual retreat to 
        Breckenridge estate next weekend. Megan Faughnan '02, the head of Student 
        Congress summed up the purposes of the retreat as a way to get people 
        acquainted with each other and with how student government works in addition 
        to setting goals for the year. <br>
        While no firm priorities have been set, some initiatives from last year 
        will likely continue to hold a place on the agenda, especially since most 
        of the projects that the SEB undertakes become long term projects. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">MacNeil explained, &quot;Student Government issues take 
        a long time to work out; it's a matter of working a long time to see things 
        happen.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One SEB priority is to look into the feasibility of getting 
        Bowdoin on a &quot;One-Card&quot; system. SEB member Jason Hafler '04 
        explained that this system would allow Bowdoin students to use a single 
        ID card for meals, laundry, copying, and possibly even local businesses. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although they work on specific projects, members of the 
        SEB stressed that the main goal of the SEB and the Student Congress was 
        to be there for the students and the school. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">SEB member Tejus Ajmera '04 said, &quot;The Administration 
        comes to us and asks for our opinion [about issues concerning the student 
        body].&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He cited the example of last week's crisis when Dean of 
        Student Affairs Craig Bradley and Dean for Academic Affairs Craig McEwen 
        came to the Student Government and asked what should be done to bring 
        the community together in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Student 
        Government members led the candlelight vigil held Thursday night. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">SEB member Lenz Balan '04 also stressed that &quot; the 
        SEB wants to establish a good relationship with the student body,&quot; 
        and that a priority of the SEB is to &quot; make sure the student body 
        knows [we are] doing stuff [for them].&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In addition to trying to become more accessible to students 
        and the administration, the SEB and the Congress are working on collaborating 
        to create a more cohesive student government. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Balan said, &quot; Meghan [MacNeil] really wants to break 
        down the barrier [between Student Congress and the SEB]&#133; last year 
        they reconstructed the constitution to give the Student Congress more 
        [of a] role.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hafler added that though he had &quot;definitely heard sentiment&quot; 
        that the SEB was too elitist and not collaborative enough with the Student 
        Congress, all the current members &quot;now just want to make Bowdoin 
        a better place.&quot; He said &quot;we are all student government; we 
        are all equals.&quot;</p>
