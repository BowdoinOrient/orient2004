        <font size="2">GENEVIEVE CREEDON</font></font></p>
      <p>In his book <i>Sophie's World</i>, Jostein Gaarder writes, &quot;the 
        only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder.&quot; 
        By this definition, we are all philosophers at birth. Whether we remain 
        so seems to be a matter of little more than chance or fate, but there 
        are times in our individual lives that thrust us back into that original 
        state. We wonder at the world around us and at ourselves, and we question. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Now is perhaps such a time for us, not only as individuals but also as 
        a human race, to return to our philosophical beginnings. Our foundations 
        have been shaken, as we have watched the foundations of our modern world 
        tremble in the face of what will surely go down as one of the most momentous 
        occurrences in history. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As we emerge from the wreckage, we are facing a changed world, a world 
        in which many of our previous notions and beliefs no longer hold true. 
        Many of us have spent the last week wondering what comes next. How can 
        we pick ourselves up? How can we regain our strength? How can we prevent 
        this tragedy from happening again?<br>
      </p>
      <p>These questions are part of an important philosophical question: how 
        ought we to live? In the past, generations have been able to avoid answering 
        this question, because modern society was formed with great care, so that 
        we didn't have to answer it time and time again. Instead, we have cycled 
        through society, finding our places, fulfilling our duties, and keeping 
        the society alive, somewhat blindly and at a great cost. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Many people have suggested that we deal with this crisis with the same 
        tools we have used in the past to deal with other crises- nationalism, 
        alliances, politics, retaliation, war. These tactics may seem logical 
        and reasonable, but, in reality, trying to use methods of the past to 
        address the concerns of our new world is like trying to apply the Pythagorean 
        theorem to a circle. <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is far easier to call on things that we know than it is to risk learning 
        something new, and it would be so much easier for President Bush and for 
        our nation, to go to war, rather than to take the risk of finding a different 
        way. If we listen for a while, though, and if we take the time to look 
        around and actually see this new world, we will see that for the first 
        time in our history as a country we are being asked to do something that 
        no one has ever done.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We are being asked not simply to acknowledge the media's comments that 
        the world has changed, but to act on it. We are being asked to wake from 
        our sleep of complacency and to cease being indifferent to what goes on 
        in the world. We are being asked to wipe the glazed look from our eyes. 
        In essence, we are being asked to voluntarily regain the &quot;faculty 
        of wonder&quot; that was taken from us so early in our lives. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If we choose to respond positively, we will be given a chance that no 
        country and no human being has ever had before. We will be given the chance 
        to be reborn alongside the new world. We will be given a chance to create 
        the world, rather than to have it create us. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We can be leaders in this new world if we choose to be. We can be leaders 
        who are neither threatening, nor intimidating, nor dominating. We can 
        be leaders by giving the world a tabula rasa, an empty slate, upon which 
        it may grow again and upon which the nations of the world can grow again, 
        can have another chance at childhood, another chance to wonder, and another 
        chance to not let our ability to wonder slip away. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We are members of a country, the United States of America. We have a 
        chance now, with this new world to become members of a new union, a union 
        that will bind together all the countries and all the people of this planet. 
        It is a risk to take that chance, to chose love over hate and peace over 
        war, but it will be far more costly not to take that risk, for, as the 
        poet W.H. Auden once said, &quot;Love each other or perish.&quot;</p>
