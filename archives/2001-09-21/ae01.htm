      <p align="left">Those are the words of the man who defied originality and 
        forced Americans to look at the pre-labeled, contrived world in which 
        they lived. Those are the words of a man who took the faces of celebrities, 
        the labels of consumerism, and depicted them as idolatrous images of American 
        society. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the early 1960's, Andy Warhol developed a technique which 
        enabled him to enlarge photographic images, transfer these images to silk 
        screen, place them on canvas, and ink the images from the back. With this 
        technique, Warhol was able to begin producing series of prints based on 
        mass media, which opened the eyes of art appreciators around the world. 
        From the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania comes a smattering 
        of these prints. The exhibition, entitled The Prints of Andy Warhol (From 
        A to B and Back Again), will be showing from September 29 to December 
        23, 2001 in the Twentieth Century and Temporary Exhibition Galleries of 
        the Walker Art Museum. This overview of Warhol's prints includes portraits 
        of cultural celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe and Mao as well as displays 
        of Warhol's famed Campbell's Soup can labels.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, before he was a man worthy of a Bowdoin College 
        welcome, he was Andy Warhola, an up-and-coming graduate of the Carnegie 
        Institute of Technology. Moving to New York, Warhola gained success as 
        a commercial artist and had his first big break at Glamour Magazine in 
        August of 1949. Not only did the magazine launch him into his illustrious 
        career, it also dropped the last &quot;a&quot; in Warhola when it credited 
        him for his illustrations in the article entitled &quot;Success is a Job 
        in New York.&quot; It was a small sacrifice to make. By 1955, the newly 
        christened Warhol was one of the most famous and sought-after commercial 
        artists in New York.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From his start as a commercial artist, Warhol went on to 
        produce prints and then experimental movies dealing with repetition, ennui, 
        and the passage of time. However, regardless of the medium, Andy Warhol 
        remained innovative throughout his career. He was not an elite artist 
        floating in the clouds above the masses; rather, he was very much a man 
        of the masses, a man created by the masses. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Pop art is for everyone,&quot; said Warhol. Anyone 
        can walk down the street of any city, pick up a crisp Coca-Cola, have 
        a hearty bowl of Campbell's soup, and see the truth of this statement. 
        It is about our daily lives, the brands we live by and it is about coming 
        to terms with &quot;the practical but impermanent symbols that sustain 
        us.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To welcome Andy Warhol to the Walker Museum, an opening 
        reception will be held on Friday, September 28 from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. 
        in the Walker Art Building. </p>
