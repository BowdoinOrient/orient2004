        Assistant Sports Editor</font></font></p>
      <p>The terrorist attacks upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 
        September 11 greatly impacted the sports world and changed the season 
        outlooks for players, coaches, and owners.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Professional Golf Association (PGA) postponed the Ryder Cup, one 
        of the largest and most important golf tournaments of the season, for 
        an entire year. U.S. Captain Curtis Strange decided that it would be simply 
        impossible for his team to play with the United States in such chaos and 
        pain.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Instead, the same American team will battle with the best European players 
        in September of 2002. The tragedy will not be forgotten, however.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Said Strange, &quot;Everybody will have their 2001 hats on. They will 
        still wear their 2001 clothes and their 2001 rain gear. That's important 
        to me, that this is the 2001 team and that we don't forget why were playing 
        a year later.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the meantime, the PGA has resumed play with the Pennsylvania Classic 
        at a course only 15 miles from where one of the hijacked planes crashed. 
        To honor the victims and express their sorrow, each flag on the 18-hole 
        course will be an American flag instead of the traditional red.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Like the PGA, the National Football League has also been forced to postpone 
        a week of their season and scramble to make up the lost games. Although 
        the league originally considered playing a 15 game schedule opposed to 
        the usual 16, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue decided against cutting regular 
        season games.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, the playoff picture is still murky because week 18, originally 
        reserved for the first round of the playoffs, will now host the last regular 
        season games. As a result, the league is searching for a plausible scenario 
        where 16 games and a full post season will fit together.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan proposed to play the first week of 
        the playoffs on the Wednesday after the end of the season. This format 
        would force some teams to play three games in eight days, a scenario that 
        makes many coaches and players worried.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Due to logistical concerns, pushing the postseason back one week is unlikely. 
        Therefore, the only other option is cut the number of teams who can make 
        the playoffs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;If a team is in a wild-card race, ask those fifth and sixth-seeded 
        teams if they would rather play on Wednesday or not at all,&quot; said 
        Shanahan. With 15 weeks left in the regular season, a final decision may 
        not be reached for some time concerning this issue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While the league has been debating such matters, many NFL players and 
        coaches have donated their time and money to help the relief effort in 
        New York City. For example, last week, about 35 New York Giants visited 
        the wreckage site to offer supplies and emotional support to the fire 
        fighters and others who have been working fairly continuously since the 
        disaster.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Finally, in the world of Major League Baseball (MLB), play resumed on 
        Monday after a five day lay-off with each team donning American flags 
        on its ball caps and jerseys. The New York Mets even wore New York Police 
        Department and Fire Department hats to show their support for the local 
        men and women fighting to save lives and dig through the rubble daily.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In a league composed of players of all nationalities, MLB has pulled 
        together under an umbrella of patriotism and respect. In fact, after the 
        Seattle Mariners won their division Wednesday night, left-fielder Mark 
        McLemore led his team around the base path with an American flag.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It was just something that came together. It wasn't choreographed. 
        I don't think I could be any prouder to be an American than I am tonight,&quot; 
        said McLemore.</p>
