      <p align="left"><font size="5">Fessenden and Hyde Series: Part 2: The Early 
        Politics of Pitt Fessenden<br>
        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI</font><font size="2"><br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p> Five years after he graduated from Bowdoin College, Franklin Pierce, 
        Class of 1824, began his career in politics by going to the New Hampshire 
        State Legislature. He would eventually become Speaker of the House and 
        then get elected to the United States Congress. His path would not cross 
        that of William Pitt Fessenden's again until the latter Bowdoin graduate 
        joined him in the United States Senate.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A year before Pierce graduated fifth in his class, William Pitt Fessenden 
        was allowed to graduate from Bowdoin College with the help of his father. 
        He had run into trouble in those last few weeks of his college career 
        and had at first been denied a degree. Luckily for him the faculty members 
        who had brought the charge against him were overruled. <br>
      </p>
      <p>But now that young Pitt Fessenden had graduated, what was he going to 
        do? Nineteenth century America was full of promise. The year 1823 was 
        still a long time away from when the sectional issue of slavery would 
        tear the nation apart with civil war. Of course Pitt Fessenden did not 
        know that. And having nothing better to do he entered himself into the 
        study of law. He worked under known attorneys in Portland and New York 
        City until he was old enough, at the age of twenty-one, to be admitted 
        to the bar. While Fessenden's work was for the law, his love was for public 
        speaking. As the temperance movement was gaining steam in Maine at the 
        time, Pitt made it known that he himself believed alcohol to be a poisonous 
        threat. And even before he was admitted to the bar, young Pitt Fessenden 
        was speaking openly about the need for higher tariffs to help support 
        the workers of America. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Whether or not anyone saw a politician in these words and ideologies 
        was probably not important for young Fessenden since the lovely Elizabeth 
        Longfellow, sister to Henry Longfellow, Bowdoin Class of 1825, saw in 
        him the man of her dreams. They were engaged in 1829 but sadly she died 
        six months later. Fessenden, shocked and angry, retreated into the world 
        of work. He barricaded himself in his studies, attempting to fight off 
        the pain of personal loss. Two years passed, however, and Fessenden was 
        engaged again, this time to Ellen Deering, daughter of a wealthy Portland 
        businessman. Love had found William Pitt Fessenden but his life was one 
        that was destined to walk a solitary path and thus in time, long before 
        his greatest trials and triumphs, this loved one too would be gone as 
        well.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Still, Pitt Fessenden was young and as life began to bloom for him again 
        he entered into the world of politics. Elected to the Maine State legislature 
        in 1831, Fessenden traveled to the new capitol in Augusta as an anti-Jacksonian 
        Whig. There was at the time, a boundary dispute between the State of Maine 
        and Great Britain. It concerned a large chunk of land that both sides 
        claimed was theirs. The matter had been placed on the desk of the King 
        of Holland to consider. His decision had not pleased the citizens of Maine. 
        In Washington DC Jacksonian Democrats ruled the country and could have 
        cared less about the issue. They saw no reason why Maine should not cede 
        parts of its current landmass to Canada and receive a payment for it in 
        return. Pitt Fessenden was at the forefront of this controversy, hammering 
        away at those sides who wanted to yield to Great Britain. Sent to Washington 
        as part of a delegation to the capital, Fessenden soon saw that there 
        was a lack of enthusiasm in support of his state's favor. The issue, at 
        this point in time, ended with Maine mostly agreeing to Washington's terms. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1832- the year that an awkward looking man by the name of Abraham 
        Lincoln first ran for public office in the state of Illinois- William 
        Pitt Fessenden was married to Ellen Deering. A family would bloom and 
        the sons that were born to the couple would also attend Bowdoin College 
        like their father. A slow life as a lawyer began here and the Fessenden's 
        moved from town to town and from law firm to law firm. Again and again 
        Fessenden's name was mentioned in conjunction with a senator's title but 
        the young lawyer would have nothing to do with it. He was, however, unable 
        to stay away from politics. In 1835 he began a friendship with Daniel 
        Webster, consequently, Webster was also Pitt Fessenden's very own godfather. 
        Webster was a leading member of the Whig party and had aspirations for 
        the nation's top office. He was, however, hopeless to run against the 
        Jacksonian Democrats. This of course didn't stop him from trying, nor 
        did it prevent Fessenden from campaigning for him as well as running the 
        gubernatorial campaign of Edward Kent, contender for the top office in 
        the State of Maine. Both of these endeavors in 1836 failed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The limelight would find Fessenden again in 1839 when he was returned 
        to the state legislature. A year later he finally caved into the demands 
        of his Whig comrades, ran, and was elected to the United States Congress. 
        <br>
        Before his journey to the District of Columbia, Congressman Fessenden 
        received a latter from his uncle. In it, Thomas Fessenden reminded him 
        that, &quot;whenever circumstances force you to the 'impassible point' 
        where conscience or popularity must one or the other of them be surrendered, 
        be true to yourself, your name and your highest interests and let it be 
        popularity that is given up and not conscience.&quot; These words of wisdom 
        William Pitt Fessenden would remember and uphold until the day he died.</p>
      <p>Next Week: Fessenden and Pierce lose faith in the system.</p>
