      <p align="left">As America faces a depressed stock market and general economic 
        slowdown, one wonders to what degree Bowdoin will be affected. A conversation 
        with College Treasurer Kent Chabotar revealed that, while the College 
        won't be shutting down any time soon, it is taking some steps to stay 
        above the economy's fluctuations.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right">
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/news02_chabotar.jpg" width="200" height="190"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><font size="2">Kent Chabotar, Treasurer of the College. (Liesl Finn, 
            <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>) </font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">&quot;I wouldn't count it as a crisis,&quot; Chabotar said. 
        &quot;We've been preparing for economic uncertainty for about two years, 
        [and] have been sensitive to it.&quot;<br>
        Bowdoin's current status is one of concern, &quot;a sort of watchful waiting,&quot; 
        Chabotar said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We're not battening down the hatches or heading for 
        the basement. We're just being prudent.&quot; He added that the College 
        is lucky to have &quot;an incredibly generous alumni body and a pretty 
        healthy endowment&quot; to keep it above difficult times.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That endowment, estimated at about $450 million, acts as 
        a buffer in times of economic instability. The College's portfolio is 
        managed chiefly by the trustees, &quot;who are all experts,&quot; Chabotar 
        said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Twenty-three percent of our budget is endowment,&quot; 
        he added. &quot;The concern, obviously, is that 23 percent is shaky.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The nose-diving stock market, which dropped significantly 
        since Monday, reflects a national state of uncertainty after last week's 
        terrorist attacks. The losses affect the endowment, which is invested 
        in a variety of places such as stocks, bonds, real estate, venture capital, 
        and private equity<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar said that he is also focused on the recession's 
        possible effects on another area of Bowdoin's finances: &quot;We're concerned 
        about family ability to pay, average family contribution, and therefore, 
        financial aid,&quot; he said. &quot;Tuition goes up every year.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The current economy is not without some benefits, however. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Inflation is low, so that means our costs are growing 
        more slowly,&quot; Chabotar said. Additionally, much as it seems that 
        diving stock prices would affect alumni giving, the treasurer said that 
        he wasn't overly concerned. &quot;[Economic problems] didn't affect [giving] 
        last year-I think we came close to breaking a record; we were way over 
        target,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The College appears to possess enough stability get through 
        this period of uncertainty. &quot;I'm pretty optimistic,&quot; the Treasurer 
        said. &quot;The nice part about having endowment is that it makes you 
        a little more immune to these swings in the market.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar acknowledged that there could be more serious decisions 
        in the College's future if the economy sinks further. &quot;If the market 
        swings too much, even a rock starts to wobble a bit,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the event of a drastic turndown, no programs or positions 
        would be fully removed. &quot;If it started to get really bad, we would 
        start to defer or postpone things, for example, building projects,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;The second thing...is to cut spending budgets-for travel 
        and that kind of expense.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The third thing we'd do would be to increase our endowment 
        spending rate a bit,&quot; he continued. That rate is calculated based 
        upon a 12-quarter market value average, and determines how much of Bowdoin's 
        endowment is spent in the budget.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Spending additional funds is something Chabotar would to 
        avoid. &quot;In my mind, that's the last thing we want to do,&quot; he 
        said. &quot;We have to worry about different generations of alumni, students, 
        and staff. If we increase endowment spending, it hurts the future.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For obvious reasons, the College would prefer to increase 
        its endowment rather than spend it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In order to give itself some extra breathing room, Chabotar 
        said that the College is looking to cut $1.4 million out of the budget 
        over the next two years. &quot;We haven't gotten clearance from the trustees 
        yet, but that's our plan right now,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He added that gift-raising efforts would likely be doubled 
        in an attempt to offset some of the waning economy's effects.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Chabotar also indicated that Bowdoin is planning a capital 
        campaign in the near future. &quot;The last campaign had endowment and 
        financial aid as a goal,&quot; he said. &quot;This next, campaign, probably 
        in two or three years, will have even a bigger goal for endowment.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">All of this planning is being done with a futuristic outlook, 
        the Treasurer said. &quot;We have to balance today's students and faculty 
        with tomorrow's.&quot;</p>
