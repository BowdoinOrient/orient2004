      <p align="left">Never before has an event left such a mark on our nation 
        as when four hijacked airplanes crashed into both World Trade Towers, 
        the Pentagon, and thanks to heroic acts of passengers, a field outside 
        of Pittsburgh. It is probably a safe bet that not only did everyone in 
        this country feel a natural emotional response of grief and outrage, but 
        for most it was personal too. New York and Washington are metropolises 
        of such magnitude that almost all Americans know someone who lives near 
        those cities. Bowdoin College is not unlike the rest of the country. Dozens 
        of students live in both affected areas and sadly many knew individuals 
        who perished, some even lost immediate family members. Yet like the rest 
        of the nation, our campus united in this time of indescribable grief and 
        loss. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of my dear friends whose hometown lost dozens of residents 
        lives in Stowe Hall. Last week, as I went back to Quinby House after commiserating 
        with her I was often inspired by the quotation that is on the plaque as 
        one enters her dormitory. It reads &quot;an atmosphere of sympathetic 
        influence encircles every human being.&quot; I imagine most of us have 
        neither noticed nor taken the time to appreciate the meaning of this wisdom 
        prior to this past week's events. I know that I hadn't. But never before 
        have I seen Harriet Beecher Stowe's wisdom so clearly embodied than in 
        the support that the Bowdoin community gave each other in this unimaginable 
        time of crisis. I have never been prouder to be a Bowdoin student than 
        I was at both candle light vigils on Thursday and Friday night when members 
        of all religious faiths overcame any fear or hesitation that they had 
        in expressing their beliefs. They prayed openly and passionately and were 
        warmly received by the community. Our uniting in hugs, songs, and expressions 
        of concern and sympathy showed the rest of the community and country that 
        even the often impenetrable &quot;Bowdoin Bubble&quot; had been shattered 
        by these cowardly acts of terror. I wish to thank the administration, 
        Residential Life staff, and professors who allowed students the opportunity 
        to express their grief, concern, and love for each other publicly. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Although the actions of Bowdoin's administration and students 
        seem natural, not all colleges and universities showed the same respect 
        to those who died innocently or those who suffer and sympathize. At Cornell, 
        students were banned from draping American flags outside their windows. 
        A student received applause at a UC-Berkeley candlelight vigil when she 
        proclaimed that we &quot;originated state-sponsored terrorism.&quot; A 
        girl at the University of Wisconsin said that the attacks reflect our 
        &quot;interventional and often coercive use of military and economic capital.&quot; 
        In addition, other friends of mine at other universities tell me that 
        this attack is entirely the fault of President Bush for neglecting to 
        walk in lockstep with the rest of the world on Kyoto and Anti-Ballistic 
        Missle treaties. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These people seem to have forgotten the attacks that took 
        place in the World Trade Tower in 1993, on US Embassies in Africa in 1998, 
        and on the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen last October. President Clinton 
        was in office during all of these tragedies. I find it ironic also that 
        many of these same students argue on the one hand that our being attacked 
        is in some way a moral equivalence to supposed injustices that we commit, 
        yet they oppose us in attacking Afghanistan. It really makes me wonder 
        who is teaching them that our country has ever done anything nearly as 
        evil as purposely killing nearly 6,000 innocent civilians in a peacetime 
        ambush.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thankfully, students or faculty that share these absurd 
        opinions are a quiet minority here at Bowdoin and they have met appropriate 
        resistance from people of all political affiliation. We know as a campus 
        that this was an attack focused not on any particular group of people, 
        but rather on all of us as Americans. Consequently, last week we came 
        together in public and private to show our grief, our horror, our outrage, 
        and our resolve to get through this time of pain and peril. On a peaceful 
        day recently I encountered a memorial on this campus that remembers the 
        last Bowdoin students or alumni to die in a terrorist attack: the bombing 
        of Pan Am flight 103. On the plaque is inscribed a beautiful quotation 
        from Ralph Waldo Emerson that should serve as appropriate guidance through 
        what could be a prolonged war: &quot;What lies behind us and what lies 
        before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.&quot; <br>
