        <font size="2">EKA TODEE THOMSON<br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The events that occurred on Tuesday, September, 11, 2001, 
        the numerous men, women, and children who died, and the number of missing 
        people whose toll amounts to more than 4,000, significantly affected the 
        Arab community throughout the world, including here at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many of the large number of international students on the 
        Bowdoin campus hope to open up the minds of their fellow students, thus 
        making them more culturally aware and understanding.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We share a common region but not common ideas or philosophies,&quot; 
        replied Iranian-born US citizen, Fariba Shaffiey, a first-year at Bowdoin. 
        Upon learning about the tragedy, she felt sad and stunned that such an 
        act of violence could take place. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As scapegoats were exploited, Shaffiey hoped the Bowdoin 
        community would exercise tolerance. She emphasized that one of the most 
        important things for people across America to understand was that the 
        group of individuals who committed this crime were members of an extremist 
        party and not an entire religion. She also expressed wishes that although 
        many citizens may be feeling acute pain or anger, they should not take 
        these feelings out on people who were not involved in creating this tragedy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Professor Munis D. Faraqui, an Indian self-identified Muslim 
        shared Shaffiey's shock and sadness over the tragedies. He emphasized 
        that it is inexcusable and shocking to assign blame to Muslims as a whole, 
        that they should not be labelled as the perpetrators of the terrorist 
        act. He also mentioned that 99.9% of all Arab-Americans are as stunned 
        as other Americans, as they realized the enormity of the act and the new 
        level of violence it has brought upon the world.<br>
        Fortunately, Farraqui has received support and encouragement from his 
        fellow colleagues at Bowdoin College. These feelings should expand throughout 
        the campus and extend to the student body. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In Monday's student digest, there was a letter from Adam 
        Greene '01 who witnessed a conversation that involved a racist exchange 
        between students aimed at Arabs and Arab-Americans.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mr. Greene reported remarks such as &quot;they should be 
        sent home packing, along with all their kind.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One international student said, &quot;Speaking out is what 
        this community needs. It is sad that young people-students-who have come 
        to college to seek knowledge and information are making that sort of ignorant 
        remark. We must not forget that nationals from Arab countries were among 
        the people killed at the World Trade Centre, not to mention Muslims from 
        Pakistan and India as well.&quot;</p>
