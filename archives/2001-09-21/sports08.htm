      <p>The Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team went into last weekend with a 2-0 record 
        and an opportunity to get a jump on two of their most potent rivals, Williams 
        and Wesleyan. Two victories would have positioned Bowdoin as the team 
        to beat in the NESCAC; however, they suffered a tough 4-1 lose to Williams 
        on Saturday. <br>

      </table>
      <p>The team played well against Williams on Saturday, but it was a day that 
        simply did not seem to go their way. Senior tri-captain Jeanne Nicholson, 
        who played outstanding defense for the team in both weekend contests, 
        articulated the team's frustration with the loss. &quot;Williams was definitely 
        a disappointment, but the score did not reflect the intensity and even 
        match-up that were on the field.&quot; <br>
        Although the Bears did not feel that they were outplayed on Saturday, 
        they were only able to score one goal in the contest, netted by sophomore 
        Jill Falwell. The women went home with an upsetting 4-1 loss.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The team rebounded from its Saturday defeat the next day, easily disposing 
        of Wesleyan by a five goal margin. Six different Polar Bear players scored. 
        According to senior tri-captain Katie Sheridan, the team's &quot;...potential 
        to have a variety of scorers is very promising. We can be an excellent 
        team if we continue to have multiple goal scoring threats,&quot; she said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Lyndsey Sennott fed Shellie Chessie '03 for the game's first goal, 
        one that Sheridan felt was perhaps &quot;the biggest play of the game,&quot; 
        she said. The Bears went on to score five more on their way to a 6-1 victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Nicholson, Sennott not only gave the team an early edge 
        in the contest, but also was a catalyst for the team's strong play that 
        followed. &quot;This game was a positive sign of what is to come for the 
        rest of the season,&quot; she remarked.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin women take on archrival Middlebury tomorrow at noon. Sheridan 
        said that she expects the game to be fiercely competitive, with little 
        margin for error. The Panther team has a host of strong returning players, 
        including an outstanding senior goalie. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With a big rivalry on the line and a sense of urgency after their first 
        NESCAC loss last weekend, the women's soccer team is hoping to play with 
        intensity and come out with a big win this Saturday.<br>
