      <p align="left">Think you have no time or money to help the environment? 
        During the next few months, Bowdoin will be making it easier and beneficial 
        for everyone to get involved. The following groups are working together 
        to increase environmental awareness and excitement around campus: Dining 
        Service, the Community Service office, Committee for a Sustainable Bowdoin 
        and the Evergreens. If you want to win a bike, reuse a bag! Reusable lunch 
        bags will be given to students volunteering at Common Good Day on September 
        22nd.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bags will also be sold outside of Polar Express in Moulton 
        Union within the next couple of weeks. Students can use Polar Points or 
        cash to buy the canvas bags. Not only are they stylish, durable and large 
        enough for you to sneak an extra cookie, but the canvas bags will prevent 
        the brown paper bags from going to landfills as well as save our college 
        money (more parsley on dinner plates!). Bags received by Common Good Day 
        participants will carry a Dining Service and Common Good Day logo, while 
        those bought on campus will sport the Sustainable Bowdoin logo. </p>
      <p align="left">How does reusing a bag help you to win a bike and other 
        great prizes?<br>
        With each bag purchase, students receive a card, which is stamped for 
        every visit to Polar Express. After 5 stamps (and 5 less brown bags used) 
        the card is dropped into the raffle jar. On October 23rd, a card will 
        be drawn and the winner receives a brand new ten speed bike! Additional 
        prizes will be awarded.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another simple way to help out on campus is to carry a reusable 
        mug. Not only will this reduce the number of paper cups ending up in the 
        trash, but the mugs remain hotter for longer periods of time, are cooler 
        on the hands, and hold more liquid in comparison to the tiny cups provided 
        in the dining halls. First-year students have no excuse, for each student 
        received their own mug during orientation. If upper-class students have 
        misplaced their mugs, new ones can be purchased at the caf&eacute; or 
        store. As a Seattle native, I am proud to announce that reusable Starbucks 
        mugs are also allowed! Carry a mug when eating in the dining hall in order 
        to bring hot chocolate or tea back to your room. When customers bring 
        their own mugs to the Caf&eacute;, they are charged the same price as 
        a large coffee and in the near future discounts will be awarded. Not only 
        is this alternative to paper cups cheap and easy, but it can also save 
        you money!<br>
        Helping the environment does not have to consume enormous amounts of time 
        or energy. By reusing lunch bags and mugs, students are contributing towards 
        the school's commitment to becoming a more sustainable Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the end, you'll be awarded by discounted coffee and possibly 
        a brand new bike. Of course, if you want to commit yourself to environmental 
        activism, come to an Evergreens meeting or visit Bowdoin's new Sustainability 
        Coordinator, Keisha Payson, in Coles Tower!<br>
