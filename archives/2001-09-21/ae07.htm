      <p align="left">The &quot;Ferocious Foodies&quot; began their 80s night 
        appropriately with <br>
        dinner at MacMillan &amp; Company. Despite the allure of a decorous awning 
        <br>
        and a pleasant wooden storefront, this restaurant dons dated wall to wall 
        <br>
        carpeting and grass-green lamps, much as the Foodies did spandex and <br>
        scrunchies. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right">

          <td><font size="2">Mac Millan &amp; Company, on Maine Street. (Henry 
            Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Families and the elderly contributed to a stilted, country 
        club atmosphere; <br>
        although the Foodies highly enjoyed the banter of small children and the 
        <br>
        presence of kids' menus. Subconsciously bobbing to the '80's Jane Fonda 
        music, the Foodies reminisced on their old magenta sports bras, high top 
        Reeboks, sweat bands, and lycra girdles. And let me tell you, Kerry is 
        fond of the Fonda.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Feeling a little too hip in black pants and suede skirts, 
        the Foodies shook off their Bowdoin pretensions and opened their laminated 
        menus to be greeted by many surf and turf options. In contrast to their 
        other ethnic dining experiences, this place was very old school American. 
        Maine offerings were well represented- one may choose from lobster, haddock, 
        shrimp, and other marine dishes. Poultry standbys included Chicken MacMillan, 
        which consists of, well, chicken nuggets for nine dollars, and there's 
        always the reliable, classic Chicken Cordon Bleu. However, Foodie number 
        one opted for a filet mignon, and Foodie number two favored a vegetarian 
        entr&eacute;e. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The server brought a much appreciated hot loaf of bread 
        and pitchers of water flavored with lemon slices. Drinks arrived expediently, 
        but the salads, which are included with entr&eacute;es, didn't come for 
        an additional thirty minutes. When they arrived, however, they were quite 
        good. The honey mustard vinagrette tasted homemade, and the olives and 
        croutons lent a complexity to the salad. <br>
        After another twenty minutes of immersion in 80s beats, the Foodies finally 
        descended upon their entrees with alacrity. Foodie number one's filet 
        indeed <br>
        sufficed; for the meat was perfectly cooked (medium rare, baby) and of 
        high quality. Unfortunately, the accompanying broccoli was meek and flaccid. 
        Our companion termed it &quot;completely psychotically gross&quot; due 
        to its odd flavoring. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now for Foodie two: first of all, &quot;fajita&quot; was 
        spelled &quot;fajhita,&quot; and secondly, this &quot;fajhita&quot; was 
        actually a wrap- it came pre-assembled and tasted anything but Mexican. 
        Asparagus and artichoke hearts were also involved in the concoction. Nevertheless, 
        the herbed tortilla and savory dressing emulsion ameliorated the fact 
        that this was a &quot;faux&quot;-jita (pun intended). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The jewel of this American crown was actually the aforementioned<br>
        &quot;Chicken MacMillan.&quot; These tenders were indeed tender, and clearly 
        fresh from the fat fryer. The chicken pieces were generous and served 
        with two <br>
        dipping choices: sweet 'n sour and BBQ, which both rocked the Foodies' 
        worlds. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, Foodie number two, Kerry, philosophized on the 
        inherent contradiction involved in the simple label of &quot;sweet and 
        sour.&quot; Nevetheless, the foodies' journey along the coastal plains 
        was yet to be completed. They wreaked havoc upon their common covenant 
        and defied their healthful ways by ordering the sinful Toll House pie. 
        The eighties prom queens were taken back to a time long past with mounds 
        of whipped cream, spoonfuls of vanilla goodness, and the sweet melt of 
        Nestle chocolate. The entire Homecoming Court could safely share this 
        colossal confection. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">MacMillan &amp; Co is certainly not without its nostalgic 
        benefits, but if tantalizing taste revolution is what one seeks, head 
        elsewhere. Patriots only.<br>
