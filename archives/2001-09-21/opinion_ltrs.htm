      <p align="left">To the Editors:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Congratulations to James Fisher for his very good article 
        &quot;<a href="http://www.bowdoin.edu/studorgs/orient/2001-09-14/news01.htm">Terror 
        bursts Bowdoin bubble</a>&quot; in last week's <i>Orient</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It has been enormously gratifying to learn of the acts of 
        kindness among students, staff, faculty and Brunswick community members 
        over the past week. I write to thank the Orient for recognizing in your 
        editorial the efforts of the many staff in the College who worked quickly 
        and carefully on September 11 to gather information about students' families 
        and alumni; who set up televisions across campus; who provided dining 
        services into the night; who set up chairs and the sound system for the 
        community meeting; and who thought about and did what needed to be done 
        in response to the day's tragic events. Staff members in Alumni Affairs, 
        A/V, Campus Safety, Career Planning, CIS, Communications, Counseling, 
        Dining, Events, Facilities Management, Residential Life, Security, Student 
        Affairs, Student Records, and elsewhere pulled together to support one 
        another and help the Bowdoin community respond meaningfully to the events 
        of the day. </p>
      <p align="left">The staff members who come to mind are those not often recognized 
        publicly for their valuable work. They are proud to be members of the 
        Bowdoin community, and without them Bowdoin would not be the community 
        it is.<br>
      </p>

      <p align="left">To the Editors:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">New York City is many things to many people. To most, it's 
        a place of intrigue; a magical wonderland of opportunity, culture, and 
        perhaps hedonism. It's a place to visit for a day, a night, or a week 
        or two. Some go to New York to take in a show, see the Guggenheim or MoMA, 
        or even pay homage to what remains of the legendary Twilo, then hit up 
        Fridays at Vinyl or Sundays at the Tunnel. Some might spend a few years 
        in the city to begin a career in one of the many lucrative industries 
        that exist there.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But to eight million people, New York City is home. Eight 
        million men and women from all over the world. Although I lack empirical 
        evidence, I would claim that in New York City there exists a community 
        of every single ethnic group across the globe. And aside from, most often 
        in spite of, the aggressive crime control tactics of the outgoing Mayor, 
        these eight million people live in a peaceful state of coexistence. One 
        need only to ride the 3 Train during the morning rush to see how vibrant 
        and diverse New York City is.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What the as-yet-unidentified terrorists destroyed on Tuesday, 
        September 11, to say nothing of the thousands of families who lost loved 
        ones, was not merely a symbol of American economic power (call it imperialism 
        if you must, but please be responsible in your word choice). The Twin 
        Towers of the World Trade Center were a point of reference, a beacon, 
        in a city that represents what America is in the 21st century. Their destruction 
        cut deep into the soul of every New Yorker, and tore the fabric of contemporary 
        American culture.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Make no mistake, there are several ignorant people across 
        the country who cling to the notion that they can and should live only 
        with people who look like they do. Their beliefs are by no means the reality 
        of our situation. The United States of America, in the 21st Century, is 
        made up of people from every corner of the earth. New York City is the 
        &quot;great melting pot&quot; of America, where eight million people have 
        found a way to live peacefully with each other and to allow their wide 
        array of cultures to thrive side by side.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The attack of September 11 was an attack on a city of tolerance. 
        As we embark on this uncertain war, we must keep in mind what we are fighting 
        for.<br>
