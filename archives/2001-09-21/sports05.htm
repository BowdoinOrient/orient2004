        Bowdoin men destroy Bates in opening scrimmage<br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font><font size="2"><br>
        Staff Writer</font></font></p>
      <p>Early last Saturday morning, the men of Bowdoin Rugby assembled behind 
        Farley Field House. The anticipation was palpable as the boys in black 
        put on their kits and strapped on their boots. They knew that within a 
        matter of minutes, they would deliver four punishing scores in their victory 
        over the Bates Bobcats. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior golden boy Mike &quot;Doza&quot; Carlson poignantly captured the 
        mood. &quot;I was so pumped that I couldn't even sleep last night. My 
        housemates had to restrain me from tearing down the walls,&quot; he said. 
        &quot;We're going to run over those Bates Bobcats.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Doza's sentiments were echoed by many of his teammates, who were eager 
        to start their championship season.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/sports08_mrugby.jpg" width="250" height="201"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Sophomore rugger Ryan Chisholm takes a crack in practice 
            this week. (Karstan Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The ferocity of the ruggers was apparent even in the opening minutes 
        of the game. Hooker Nathaniel &quot;Crabs&quot; Wolf '02, toughened by 
        being raised barefoot amongst the wolves in the mountains of Vermont, 
        immediately made his presence felt upon the field. Using his diminutive 
        stature and amazing speed to his advantage, Crabs made some of the day's 
        finest hits in those first few minutes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The real power came from forward captain Billy Soares '02, who delivered 
        punishing blows that sent the Bates boys reeling. Soares, known for entering 
        a berseker-like state upon the field, teamed up with his cooler-headed 
        fellow senior Kristopher &quot;Jaws&quot; Bosse to guarantee Polar Bear 
        posession of the ball at every ruck. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With this amazing duo in the front, the back row was able to put the 
        ball over the tryline four times with amazing precision. Club president 
        Rob Mandle '02 made two of these scores. A former track star, Mandle now 
        focuses exclusively upon rugby because he prefers its &quot;more laid 
        back, less-regimented style of play,&quot; he said. Whatever his reasons, 
        Mandle's track abilities shone through as he streaked through Bates defenders. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Another back who made his presence felt was junior Dennis Kiley. As was 
        mentioned last week, there were worries as to whether or not Kiley could 
        return to his former level of performance after his injuries last year. 
        He left no doubt in anyone's mind about that on Saturday morning when 
        he scored a solid try off an assist from senior Tory &quot;Hands&quot; 
        Lidell.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As in every great battle, there was a cost to victory. During the match, 
        Colin &quot;Wendy&quot; Heinle '03 was caught in the friendly fire of 
        fellow junior Dave Kirkland. Wendy, out for the rest of the season with 
        a broken ankle, is philosophical about the whole affair. &quot;Sure, I'm 
        angry that I'm on crutches, but I'm consoled by the fact that I got hurt 
        trying to do what's most important, puting the ball in the opponent's 
        try-zone.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>There were other injuries as well. Sophomore Warren Dubitsky, who personally 
        caused almost a dozen concussions and other serious injuries amongst the 
        Bobcats, seperated his shoulder while trying to take on the entire Bates 
        pack. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, an untold number of Bates players were seriously hurt, 
        some critically, when senior Aryeh &quot;Flabio&quot; Jasper unleashed 
        his signiature belly flop block. New England Rugby Football Union officials 
        are still out as to whether this is a technically legal move.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Head Coach Rick Scala, when asked about the victory, was ebulliant. &quot;These 
        guys are great. I couldn't ask for a better group of seniors to lead this 
        team,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no doubt in my mind that we are going 
        to New Englands [the championship tournament] this year. It really gets 
        my blood flowing. God, I'm excited.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers face far-off Plymouth State tomorrow, a match which is expected 
        to be a protracted and bloody affair. But the team leadership is confident 
        of victory. There have been rumours of the black pack utilizing some secret 
        Irish coaching techniques to ensure victory. Whether this is true or not, 
        anyone who is out behind Farley in the afternoon can see that the ruggers 
        are training hard for what many view as a critical victory. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When asked why he was so optimistic about his team's chances for this 
        Saturday, back captain Jason Pietrafitta '02 provided critical insight 
        in listing the team's three key elements: &quot;We're faster, we're stronger, 
        and we're better,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So if you're in the New Hampshire area tomorrow, come on over to Plymouth 
        State to watch the men's rugby team continue its championship season. 
        It's going to be great.<br>
