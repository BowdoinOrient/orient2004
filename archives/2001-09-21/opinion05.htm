      <p align="left"><font size="5">Why the rankings really are important<br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">For those of us who've been here for a few years, we've 
        watched the fortunes of Bowdoin sometimes fall, but usually rise in the 
        annual <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> college rankings. In my own 
        time here, Bowdoin has been as low as number nine and as high as its current 
        number five. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While many ballyhoo and dismiss the annual rankings, I have 
        nothing but praise and enthusiasm for Bowdoin's climb in the rankings. 
        Whether we like it or not, many people will judge Bowdoin based partly, 
        if not in full, upon these rankings. Bowdoin owes it to us, the students, 
        to ensure that she remains high in these rankings.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In all honesty, you are probably going to receive a high 
        quality education no matter where you go within the top fifty or even 
        top one hundred liberal arts colleges. Sure Amherst is going to have slightly 
        better faculty and resources than Wheaton College, but they both cost 
        about the same and both offer a great education. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So why do the 89% of us who are from out of state come to 
        Maine? <br>
        Simply put, we want that Bowdoin stamp on our diplomas. We worked hard 
        in high school to get in here, and now we want our diplomas to open some 
        doors for us and create opportunities. I sure as heck hope that by working 
        hard to come to Bowdoin, I will have more opportunities available to me 
        upon graduation than my friends from home who slacked off and went to 
        Wheaton. We are buying into the Bowdoin reputation. As students making 
        a $30,000 annual investment in the college (and the diploma we will hopefully 
        receive), we have a right to a return upon our investment. Bowdoin must 
        pay attention to these rankings as they directly impact upon our investment 
        here.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">College administrators across the country, and Bowdoin is 
        no exception, always prepare two standard responses to the release of 
        the US News rankings. For those who have seen a drop in their rankings, 
        they will confidently dismiss the rankings as insignifigant and irrelavent. 
        How, they will say, can anyone reduce an academic institution to mere 
        numbers on a standarized scale and get an accurate depiction of the place? 
        Surely people will see beyond these non-important numbers. An attractive, 
        if a bit naive view of the world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Those administrators whose colleges have gone up on the 
        scale will react exactly as our own Dean McEwan did. McEwan both treated 
        this as an acknowledgement of Bowdoin's greatness while belittling one 
        component of the <i>US News</i> ranking, the faculty resource rating (in 
        which we placed 77th). Even those colleges who do well in the ratings 
        feel an understandable dissatisfaction with something that people put 
        so much stock in that is beyond their control.<br>
        <i>US News</i> does have a valid point in the faculty resource rating. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin does not pay its faculty nearly enough. Our faculty 
        is the heart and soul of this institution and they deserve proper compensation. 
        So what should Bowdoin do? Raise the faculty salaries. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This would fullfill two of Bowdoin's obligations. First 
        to the faculty, to whom Bowdoin owes a great deal. Second to the students, 
        who are investing in a Bowdoin education. Bowdoin's star would rise in 
        the faculty resource rating and, consequentially, in the overall ranking. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This is not an indictment of the liberal arts education 
        experience. I am a great fan of the liberal educational experience and 
        hold a special reverance for its pursuit of academic and moral excellence. 
        This article is an attempt to argue from a practical perspective about 
        Bowdoin's relationship to the US News Rankings.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The enhanced prestige of the college, of which the <i>US 
        News</i> rankings are a vital component, will benefit us all now and for 
        years to come. So three cheers to Bowdoin for enhancing the value of our 
        investment, and let us hope that our stock continues to rise for years 
        to come.<br>
