      <p align="left"><font size="5">Little movie about little person has lots of heart</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">LESLIE BRIDGERS<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">While movie genres tend to run in periodic waves from the predictability of teen horror flicks to the onset of poorly-plotted Mafia comedies, the theme of November 2003 is something very different: movies about little people. </p>
<p align="left">While loaded vans of disappointed <i>Matrix</i> fans are trekking back to Hoyts to find some comic relief in Will Ferrell's rendering of a not-so-little elf, the Sundance smash hit <i>The Station Agent</i> is patiently waiting right down the road at the Eveningstar Cinema.</p>
<p align="left">Peter Dinklage plays Fin, a train enthusiast understandably bitter about the pointing and staring that his dwarfism provokes. When his train shop closes down at the death of the shop owner, Fin takes the opportunity to move away to his newly inherited train depot in a middle-of-nowhere New Jersey town, aptly named Newfoundland. Though Fin's favorite attribute of his new home is its desolation, he cannot seem to avoid company. </p>
<p align="left">Joe (Bobby Cannavale), a temporary street vendor filling in for his sick father, has set up shop in Newfoundland. Lucky for Fin, the loud-mouthed but charming young man and his hot dog stand sit right outside the depot's door. Between chatting up customers and gossiping on his cell phone, Joe cannot help but knock on Fin's door, begging him come out and play. </p>
<p align="left">Just as desperately as Fin tries to distance himself from everyone, Joe insists on being his friend. Joe's innocent and incessant cajoling, when offset by Fin's blunt disinterest, provides humor throughout the movie. However, the drama commences when one of Joe's customers, Olivia Harris (Patricia Clarkson), enters Fin's life too. </p>
<p align="left">Despite his uncommon stature and his social coldness, people are drawn to Fin, and Olivia, a quirky, klutzy middle-aged artist, is no exception. Though Olivia brings her fair share of comedy to the scene, we soon discover that beyond this eccentric fa‡ade is a lonely woman grieving the death of her young son and the break-up of her marriage. </p>
<p align="left">Emotions immediately unload when she meets Fin by nearly running him over...twice. She ends up sharing a bottle of bourbon with him and crashing on his couch.</p>
<p align="left">Though Joe made his own assumptions when seeing the woman leave the depot in the morning, Fin and Olivia's bond only briefly crosses the boundaries of friendship. As Joe continues to play the futile matchmaker between his two acquaintances, the three become close friends. Through gift exchanging, train watching, and simply being together, they are suddenly inseparable. </p>
<p align="left">When family takes both Joe and Olivia away from Fin, he reverts back to his hermitic ways. However, Fin's daily rituals become empty and meaningless without his friends. The man who once wanted nothing more than to be left alone is lonely. </p>
<p align="left">The plot follows with a typical course of conflict followed by reconciliation. Both Fin and Olivia have dramatic outbursts that are out-of-place and unnecessary. The abrupt ending is effortlessly happy, leaving the audience confused. With a beautiful build-up highlighted by clever comedy, solid acting, and social commentary to boot, the supposed climax is the low point of the film. And while something can be said of leaving an audience still wanting more, <i>The Station Agent</i> leaves us needing more.</p>
<p align="left">Compelling characters and the interactions between them are tender and amusing. However, the final scenes of crisis and consolation are so awkward and unsatisfying that previous emotional investments in the movie are almost insignificant. </p>
<p align="left">There are so many successes within this film that its failures are disturbingly blatant and detrimental. While <i>The Station Agent</i>'s lessons of companionship and acceptance may last, so will the bitter disappointment of its unsatisfactory ending.</p>
