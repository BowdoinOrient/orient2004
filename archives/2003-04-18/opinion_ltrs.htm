      <p align="left"><font size="5">Terror's roots in social issues</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In his editorial in the last issue of The Orient, Yaron Eisenberg attempted 
        to explain the causes of terror by claiming that acts of terrorism are 
        committed simply because &quot;they work.&quot; </p>
      <p>Of course, he is partially correct. What is troubling is the fact that 
        his monocausal and ultimately superficial explanation fails to address 
        the deeper and far more important question: why is it that suicide bombings 
        and hijackings have come to be seen as the only actions with even a degree 
        of efficacy by a portion of the Muslim world? Surely it is not simply 
        because &quot;they work&quot; - if terrorism was truly a lasting and effective 
        method of bringing about political change, we would presumably see it 
        being carried out by a wide spectrum of political groups and not simply 
        those who are denied a voice in the world arena.</p>
      <p>Committing an act of terror in which one takes one's own life is not 
        a natural human inclination. The fact that groups like al Qaeda have such 
        an easy time recruiting members amongst Arab populations is evidence in 
        itself that the people of the Middle East feel desperate and backed into 
        a corner by the overwhelmingly dominant influence of the western world. 
        If we want to stave off future 9/11s it is imperative that we recognize 
        that the populations from which terrorists draw their support do have 
        legitimate concerns that are far too quickly dismissed.</p>
      <p>The concern voiced by thinkers like Eisenberg is that to make concessions 
        to terrorist groups amounts to appeasement. Although this may be true 
        in the short-term, by eliminating the socio-economic conditions that allow 
        these groups to flourish their support will likely erode: remember that 
        Hezbollah and other groups gained an initial foothold providing food and 
        hospitals when Israel and the United States could or would not do so.</p>
      <p>It is a very rare individual who will give his life to achieve a goal 
        if that goal can be accomplished effectively by other, peaceful means. 
        Past experience have proven that opening dialogue can work and that the 
        problem is that people on both sides lack the patience to make peace lasting. 
        Finding a solution to problems such as the Palestinian problem will require 
        concessions by both sides-this cannot happen, however, until the West 
        realizes that terrorism is a problem with socio-economic roots that cannot 
        be destroyed by sanctions and bombs.</p>

      <p align="left"> To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin College's dining service has a reputation as one of the best in 
        the nation. Few students, whether they are hamburger lovers, vegans, or 
        possibly even fruitarians, would disagree that our dining service works 
        hard to provide students with delicious food. What students may not know, 
        however, is that in addition, they make the extra effort of caring where 
        the food they use is from. In light of environmental and health concerns, 
        our dining service looks to purchase local, organic food when available. 
        While students here have the luxury of getting delightful food instantly 
        upon swiping their card and grabbing a tray, the dining staff is conscious 
        about the entire process of food production, transportation and preparation.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Some people may ask, what does it matter if food travels in trucks 3,000 
        miles from California, as long as it gets to my plate intact? What one 
        may not realize is that purchasing food from across the country significantly 
        impacts the environment and nutritional quality of food. On average, for 
        every calorie consumed, it takes another 10 calories of fossil fuels to 
        produce, process and transport (FFC). Long distance shipping demands not 
        only excessive fuel, but also packaging and time. In just six days, leafy 
        green vegetables lose fifty-percent of their nutritional content (Barrett, 
        Jo). While some may not notice whether or not the meat in their hamburger 
        came from a large Midwest corporate farm, or from a local farm just down 
        the road, they may care that massive livestock farms degrade the environment 
        through erosion, soil depletion and polluted run-off, and such farms often 
        feed their cows antibiotics and steroids that eventually accumulate in 
        humans. In response to these concerns, Dining Services actively pursues 
        means to buy from local, responsible farms and manufacturers with higher 
        quality products. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Jon Wiley, purchasing director for the dining halls, commented that the 
        Bowdoin kitchens have come &quot;full circle&quot; in terms of looking 
        for local, organic foods. In its early years, Bowdoin could use vegetables 
        and fruits employees grew right in their own gardens. In the mid-nineties 
        stricter sanitary guidelines resulted in a decrease of locally grown food. 
        Many factors can make using local foods difficult. On average, local organic 
        food can be more expensive. Additionally, the differing timetables of 
        growing seasons and school sessions make purchasing fresh local products 
        difficult. Bowdoin's dining service runs a tight schedule and needs consistent 
        daily deliveries. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In an effort to return to the practice of buying local, Bowdoin has begun 
        purchasing from local farms aided by the Farm Fresh Connection. Rosalind 
        May, a student working with Farm Fresh Connection and the Dining Services 
        for a service-learning project explains that Farm Fresh Connection is 
        an organization that &quot;works to establish connections between local 
        farmers and institutions such as Bowdoin College. FFC acts as a liaison 
        between local farmers and institutions, encouraging institutions to purchase 
        food for their dining services from local farmers, and providing the opportunity 
        to farmers to broaden their markets through selling through FFC to institutions.&quot; 
        Not only does this program allow Bowdoin students to reap the benefits 
        of superior food, but it also helps Maine commerce. Russell Libby of The 
        Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association cites that &quot;if every 
        household in Maine spent 10 dollars per week on local food, it would keep 
        $100 million circulating in the Maine economy every 6 months.&quot; To 
        expand Farm Fresh Connection's capacity, the program is looking to establish 
        holding facilities and a possible coop to facilitate easier storage and 
        shipment for both farmers and purchasers.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Jon Wiley stresses that by both participating in the Farm Fresh Connection 
        and buying smart, in large quantities, Dining Services can overcome some 
        of the minor setbacks to buying locally. Michele Gaillard, assistant director 
        of operations, noted that Dining Services is &quot;willing to sacrifice 
        price to do the right thing, because that's what we know the students 
        are interested in.&quot; She says that it's become important for people 
        to know where their food is coming from, and that the animals are treated 
        humanely.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Resulting from the Farm Fresh Connection, Bowdoin receives root vegetables, 
        organic apples, strawberries, blueberries and peas from local farmers. 
        Recently, they switched from the international corporation Nissons to 
        Country Kitchens Bread, a local company located in Auburn, Maine. Our 
        beans come from the Kennebec Bean Company, and Oakhurst, which does not 
        allow suppliers to use artificial growth hormones, supplies our milk. 
        Wolfe's Neck Farm supplies a significant amount of the hamburger meat 
        and sausages. Wolfe's Neck farm has been raising cows on their saltwater 
        farm located in Freeport, as well as Bowdoin owned land in Brunswick, 
        since the 1950's. The farm practices rotational grazing to preserve the 
        fields' productivity, does not use steroids or antibiotics, synthetic 
        fertilizers, pesticides, or livestock feed additives. One of the Dining 
        Services's current goals is to use this all-natural beef exclusively. 
        For those people staying on campus in the summer, even more local produce 
        will be available for the menus. This summer, Dining Services hopes to 
        start an herb garden to supply fresh seasonings for meals. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In celebration of Earth Week, from April 21 to 26, the Dining Services 
        will be featuring an extended menu offering more local and or organic 
        products. Any fish and shellfish will be harvested or farmed in Maine 
        waters. Fair trade coffee from Eco-Preserve will be served every night. 
        Not only is this shade grown coffee sustainably produced without clearing 
        rainforest land, but also, 25 cents per pound is donated to Coffee Kids, 
        an organization supporting farmers in Central and South America. All onions, 
        beans, carrots, parsnips, beets and potatoes will be organic, locally 
        grown produce. Local companies such a Vita's tortillas of Freeport will 
        be featured, and for dessert, Shaines of Maine will be providing all the 
        ice cream. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Exemplified by the comment card system, elaborate holiday meals, decorations 
        and friendly service, it is apparent that the Dining Services cares about 
        the quality and integrity of Bowdoin food. Strong efforts to help Maine 
        businesses and the environment are more commendable actions worthy of 
        recognition. </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Chem-free options don't satisfy</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the community:</p>
      <p align="left">It's Saturday, 10:45 p.m. The closing bell has just rung 
        in the library; I pack up. The minute I step outside, I hear them-those 
        wonderful drunken sounds. Depending on the week it has or hasn't been, 
        I walk back to my room, cursing the quasi-ubiquitous intoxicated voices, 
        or laughing them off. Either way, as I see lights go on in the houses 
        that border campus, I can't help but feel guilty. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the morning, I get up to deliver the Sunday papers and am struck by 
        the smell of someone's &quot;tipsy&quot; evening deposited on the rug. 
        As I pass through the houses and dorms, I step over and around strewn 
        bottles and cups, spot a broken chair, a toppled speaker. I assure you, 
        it makes for quite a silent morning scene-every now and then I want to 
        take a photograph; I would call it &quot;College life.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left"> I was that student who was thrilled that I could live in 
        &quot;chem-free&quot; housing at Bowdoin, until I realized it only meant 
        that people didn't drink in the dorm itself. Still present are the drunken 
        voices and more telling displays on floors. On an undergraduate campus, 
        where the vast majority of students are underage, can someone please explain 
        why &quot;chem-free&quot; is an exception, an option? The need for such 
        designations (and it is a <i>need</i>) is a huge problem-one of many indications 
        that campus drinking practices are not only tolerated, but sanctioned 
        by the College.</p>
      <p align="left"> When I wanted to transfer last year, I wasted a lot of 
        energy trying to convince my parents that weekends on campus are really 
        &quot;that bad.&quot; Even if I want to get work done, the library closes 
        at 11:00 p.m.; trying to work in a first-year dorm is a futile endeavor; 
        and there is nowhere else to go. Not only did my parents not believe that 
        the drinking problem could possibly be that bad (after all, President 
        Mills, speaking to the question during parents' weekend, assured them 
        that it was not a huge problem and was being addressed), but they made 
        excuses about &quot;having fun&quot; and &quot;relaxing&quot; a little. 
        Perhaps knowing that the police department has now put up signs will be 
        a bit more convincing, though part of me feels it's a waste of money. 
        God knows students barely do the reading they're supposed to do for classes, 
        not to mention that reading requires the ability to see <i>clearly</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the housing lottery proceeds yet again, my frustrations abound. Having 
        lived the year out at Boody Street-the &quot;quiet&quot; dorm-which has 
        been anything but quiet, options have dwindled. And I have to say, the 
        idea that the brand new MacMillan building now accommodates a social house 
        known for rowdiness, while the &quot;quiet&quot; people are in the much-abused 
        former frat house, bothers me just a little. Yes, I know it's nice for 
        the neighbors, who no longer have to deal with noise; actually, I'm quite 
        glad for them. But Boody might well be the worst choice for a &quot;quiet&quot; 
        dorm. Although the paper-thin walls make for intimacy (everyone can hear 
        everyone else's business four doors down), I can't exactly say that the 
        environment is conducive to quiet or work-to say nothing of the minor 
        detail that it also houses those who &quot;got screwed&quot; by the lottery 
        and just happened to end up there with no great attachment to quiet.</p>
      <p align="left"> So, what are the options? &quot;Chem-free&quot; at Howard 
        or Mayflower-mainly quads or triples-and Howell. The Howard option seems 
        pointless since it's still in the middle of the weekend mess (just walk 
        by Stowe or the Tower on a Saturday). Mayflower has been only part &quot;chem-free,&quot; 
        which makes for an interesting match-up. And the social house option is, 
        well, for those who want a social house. There are no options for singles 
        and few doubles. I thought of moving off-campus, though I'm not sure I 
        want the hassle right now. Plus, this is a RESIDENTIAL college; at least 
        that's what Res. Life keeps stressing-I shouldn't have to make excuses 
        for wanting to be on campus-looks like I'll spend another nomadic year 
        trying to find a quiet place.</p>
      <p align="left"> Though I know I am not alone, my parent's might say that 
        I'm an exception, even, perhaps, an extreme. Forgive me, I came to college 
        to learn, to engage intellectually and have a place to enjoy my studying, 
        reading and writing. I know, I know-how ridiculous! Among the best hours 
        of my week are usually those few weekend night hours when the library 
        sheds its &quot;social&quot; coat, except that the library hours even 
        seem to enforce the unspoken drinking policy. The college, while it does 
        work to provide some social alternatives through performances etc., does 
        very little to provide &quot;chem-free&quot; or quiet alternative spaces. 
        However much the faculty may be trying to create a more intellectual atmosphere 
        on campus (and I know there are some initiatives), college life is a 24/7 
        reality. At a school parents are paying good money to support, that means 
        that even a minority of students should not be struggling to maneuver 
        their lives around the illegal and disruptive actions of the majority, 
        especially not under the eyes of a &quot;responsible&quot; administration. 
      </p>
