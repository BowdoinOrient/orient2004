        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> There's something about Jack Nicholson's face that makes 
        one think of all that is psychotic and strange. From films such as The 
        Shining and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next to As Good As It Gets, the 
        man is known for playing guys with serious mental issues. And he's damn 
        good at it too. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Then there's Adam Sandler. Angry and resentful, but always fun-loving, 
        his films are the trivial adventures of low stakes: going from zero to 
        hero as a nutty football player, a momma's boy without a diploma, a burned-out 
        toll booth worker, and even Satan's son.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The first of these is a world-renowned actor with decades of serious acting 
        experience under his belt and three shiny Oscars to show for it. The second 
        is nothing of the sort. And yet, these two polar opposites appear together 
        in Anger Management, a comedy about a guy who goes from weak floormat 
        to in-your-face manly man, thanks to a couple of grueling weeks with an 
        eccentric therapist. Right up Sandler's alley in every way. And Jack? 
        He's just taking a break from the difficult stuff and going along for 
        the joyride.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Not to say it's out of his reach-Jack hasn't starred in too many comedies, 
        and yet this comes as no big surprise. He's got it, he just hasn't stooped 
        to explore it. But God bless'im. It takes a special kind of statu-a real 
        brash confidence-to be able to dabble in lower film forms without losing 
        face. It's too bad that his divine influence couldn't make this one of 
        Sandler's best.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The plot certainly had some potential. Sandler plays Dave Buznik, a mild-mannered 
        fat-cat sweater maker (don't ask) with little control over his life. When 
        a stewardess (&quot;flight attendant,&quot; he is corrected) won't bring 
        him a headset and the situation escalates out of control, Dave is sentenced 
        to anger management therapy under Doctor Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), 
        who proceeds to make his life a living hell by moving in with him and 
        subjecting him to the very worst in his anger program. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Strictly speaking, the film had laughs to spare. It doesn't get much funnier 
        than Sandler tackling a monk who used to be the guy who teased him in 
        elementary school. Especially when that monk is played by that boo-hoo 
        clown John C. Reilly. I could've been on my feet for that one. And how 
        about that loincloth wedgie? Cry about it, Mr. Cellophane. You know you 
        didn't deserve that Oscar nomination. Yeah that's right. See if this movie 
        gets any critical acclaim, monk man, and here's a nookie from me to you. 
        Revenge is sweet.</p>
      <p align="left">
        And not enough can be said for the surprisingly effective comedic chemistry 
        between the two very different lead actors. Already late to work, Rydell 
        makes Dave stop in the middle of a two-lane Staten Island bridge to &quot;regain 
        his composure.&quot; As angry New York City commuters give Dave a piece 
        of their mind, Rydell pulls out &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot; from West Side 
        Story and commands Dave to sing. This scene should have been excruciatingly 
        cheesy-remember the poolside musical from Billy Madison?-but with Sandler's 
        priceless vocal talents mixed in with Jack's stunning accompaniments and 
        almost acrobatic eyebrows (freaky face I tell you), the scene is saved.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But despite the laughs, the movie still reeks of a little too much painful 
        misfortune. As things get worse and worse for poor Dave-Rydell sleeps 
        nude in his bed, makes him late for work, and ends up practically stealing 
        his girlfriend-it gets a bit harder to watch, and harder to believe. Although 
        the film tries to make up for it with a happy ending, albeit a way too 
        over-the-top one-it's got a park, a sunny day, and people dancing in a 
        circle, go figure-it was not enough to recover lost ground. It was about 
        as satisfying and profound as Keanu Reeves and smacked sorely of Sandler 
        staleness, going beyond his usual dose of blatant self-mockery. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Not that the movie is any less fun to watch. Who doesn't want to see Woody 
        Harrelson in a cameo as the male hooker &quot;Galaxia?&quot; Or two porn 
        star lesbians shamefully sharing their angry outbursts while in &quot;sessions&quot; 
        with &quot;clients&quot; for the attentive male members of their anger 
        support group? And how about Heather Graham's reaction to Dave's dictated 
        pick-up line about her making him want to &quot;explode in his pants?&quot; 
        Priceless moments, people. Priceless. If you're in the mood for a little 
        mad mindlessness and yet another dose of crazy Jack, Anger Management 
        is not to be missed. </p>
