        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> &quot;Craig Kielberger is such a tool.&quot; Honk, quack!, 
        meehhhhhh, hee-HAW.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Dude, Tony Kushner is full of&#133;&quot; Grrrr, ROAR, ee ee ee 
        ooh ah ah ah!, moooo, buck buck buck buCAAAAAWK.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Discourse at this school is like a freaking circus. A circus overrun with 
        farm and zoo animals, zooming around in clown cars, jumping through fiery 
        hoops, and juggling eight hens and a rabbit while riding a unicycle. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the past two weeks, we have had the good fortune of hosting two bright, 
        eloquent, impassioned, and uncompromising speakers, and in a time when 
        I can barely turn on the TV for fear of seeing my president patronizing 
        me with two-minute, dumbed-down, sound-bites about &quot;freedom&quot; 
        and &quot;democracy,&quot; in a time when I no longer look forward to 
        receiving Time magazine because it might have Saddam's face crossed by 
        a bloodied X, in a time when all of my professors have decided to only 
        talk about talking about the war&#133;in times like these, a girl gets 
        a hankering for someone to stand up and give a bright, eloquent, impassioned 
        and uncompromising speech. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And so one would think that a girl would be fat and happy, well fed by 
        the recent speeches of Kielberger and Kushner, two very smart people who 
        have wandered into our midst and given us two excellent models of how 
        to go about righting some very serious wrongs in this world. But some 
        students' reaction was to hem and haw, stamp and snort, and wait to forget. 
        And it is this display of intellectual prodigality that confirms my suspicions 
        that the liberal left is not only too fragmented, but too impatient and 
        confused to get anything done.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The snorting and huffpuffling that took place after Craig Kielberger, 
        in my experience, was a pure, unadulterated form of idiocy. An alarming 
        number of people refused to go because his picture on the poster made 
        him look like a &quot;tool,&quot; and/or a &quot;douche&quot; (excuse 
        me for that). Now. I don't just find this stupid. And mark, I do see the 
        comedic value in such statements. I mean, I saw the poster, I have the 
        book&#133;Craig does have that 'Hidey-ho kidaroos, let's go and save the 
        world, wheeee!!&quot; look about him. But that we are not intelligent 
        and perceptive enough to suck up our own childish tendencies and at least 
        listen to a boy who has genuinely made a HUGE impact on the world for 
        the better&#133;well this is just sad. And moreover, if all some of us 
        can do is name call and cluck and roar when someone comes to us with such 
        a peaceful, hopeful message...then I would have to say that we are doing 
        something wrong. </p>
      <p align="left">
        And this is a skill that I learned from my good man Tony Kushner, who 
        reminded me that it is OK to think that someone else is wrong. We are 
        truly crippled by the pressures of being politically correct and we have 
        been rendered useless in the arena of political debate. This is not to 
        say being PC has no place, but it certainly cannot be used as a swooshing 
        red cape to divert attention from the actuality of our own apathy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We, the Inadequate Matadors see a bull charging towards us and we think 
        &quot;Well, I may not understand this bull's need to skewer me on his 
        horrible horns, but who am I to say what this bull should think, what 
        this bull should do?&quot; But instead I say, quit your fancy, ineffective 
        cape-work and draw your intellectual swords! Stand your ground! We are 
        intelligent students and we sell ourselves short by feeling the need to 
        validate every freaking opinion in this wide world. Some people are wrong. 
        And you have the right and duty to battle that person to the end of your 
        cerebral wits. You are wasting this education if you don't.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But beware. Speaking your mind does not entail spouting snippets of Zen 
        wisdom or citing statistics vaguely remembered from CNN ticker tape. Nor 
        is it appropriate to say you liked or didn't like a speaker as provocative 
        as the ones we have seen and then move on. There is another thing that 
        Tony Kushner taught me that is more important than realizing another person 
        might be wrong. He taught me that you have to do your research. If you 
        disagree, you better be able to articulate why. If you are moved by a 
        speaker, you need to go out and learn more. If think they are dead wrong, 
        you need to formulate a convincing argument beyond the three minute &quot;discussions&quot; 
        some of us have at this school after a speaker that go something like 
        this:</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;You bought that, man?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;I mean, yeah. Dude was smart.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Oh, whatever. Did you see his tie?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Huh huh&#133;yeah&#133;fair enough. Is the pub open?&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        HeeeeeeHAAAAAWWWWW.</p>
      <p align="left">
        We pay for more than this. We are so privileged, we pay so much money 
        for these people to come speak, and we piss it away with inane discussion. 
        I'm sorry to sound so angry&#133;I'm not angry&#133;it's a beautiful day 
        outside (actually, when I started this article it was a beautiful day&#133;now, 
        April 16, it is a cold a horrifying throwback to the frozen tundra of 
        a Maine winter). But the point is, we have brilliant people coming to 
        speak, brilliant professors giving lectures, and brilliant peers all around. 
        But when we let ourselves riot around on our unicycles with our hens and 
        rabbits, snorting and squawking, all that brilliance goes up in a glittering, 
        clown-colored ball of smoke. </p>
