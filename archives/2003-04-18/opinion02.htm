      <p align="left"> After American troops failed to protect Iraqi museums from 
        the full-scale looting and destruction that took place last week, British 
        scholars are doing what they can to come to the rescue. The British Museum 
        promised on Tuesday to send a taskforce of conservators and curators to 
        Iraq to help historians there salvage what is left and document what is 
        missing. When the museums in Baghdad and Mosul reopen, their Mesopotamian 
        collections will probably include pieces lent or given by the British 
        museum.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The offer is a statement of trust and solidarity within the scholarly 
        world, but it is also an indication of how much has been destroyed. Only 
        in times of tragedy does a community bind together to such an extent, 
        and the real tragedy is that much of the loss could have been prevented.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Historians had been warning for months that the museums would be an easy 
        target for looters after Saddam fell. Some museums had suffered even after 
        the first Gulf War, which left the government's police system intact. 
        When the predicted destruction came, however, the troops that weren't 
        guarding the oil wells were too busy knocking down statues of Saddam Hussein 
        to come to the rescue of the more ancient statues in the Iraq Museum.</p>
      <p align="left">
        During the two full days of looting, in which approximately 170,000 objects 
        disappeared from the museum in Baghdad, museum officials begged the US 
        army for protection. Some soldiers came over for half an hour &quot;at 
        lunchtime,&quot; according to the New York Times, fired some shots into 
        the air to frighten the looters, and left again. Most of the looters were 
        poor Iraqis, with no clear idea of what they were stealing. It would have 
        taken very little to keep them away permanently, but the Americans couldn't 
        be bothered.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the American soldiers' reaction to the looting and the reaction of 
        the British museum, there are two entirely different views of Iraq, and 
        two different predictions for its future. In the American view, Iraq is 
        the country of oil wells and Saddam Hussein. Having toppled Saddam Hussein, 
        our duty is now to protect the oil wells so that we can bring democracy 
        to Iraq and make a profit at the same time. We are concerned only with 
        the future of Iraq, not the past, and we have no responsibility to protect 
        its history.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second viewpoint sees Iraq as a country with deep historical roots, 
        a country with record of civilizations so ancient that Saddam's reign 
        is just an eye blink in comparison. It sees the artifacts in the Iraq 
        museum as both a part of Iraq's national identity and as treasures for 
        the entire world. It sees Iraq as a country that has existed and been 
        independent for a very long time, and will continue to be.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second viewpoint is the correct one. Among the treasures that were 
        lost, possibly forever, in last week's looting was the earliest existing 
        piece of writing, and one of the earliest examples of mathematics. It 
        is not just the history of Iraq that has suffered, but the history of 
        humanity.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It is hard to know yet just what the U.S.'s long term plans for Iraq are. 
        But if Iraq is to be an independent nation again, and not a colony of 
        an imperialist U.S., then the British Museum will deserve some thanks 
        for treating Iraq as an equal, and not as a conquered enemy.</p>
