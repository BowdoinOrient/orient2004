      <p align="left">In a discussion series meant to address issues surrounding 
        the war in Iraq, BSG invited current Director of Multicultural Programs 
        Wil Smith '00 to speak about his time serving in the U.S. Military on 
        Monday evening in Ladd House. A current reservist, Smith served several 
        years of active duty before coming to Bowdoin as a student. He says, &quot;My 
        time of importance is my earlier years in the Navy in 1991 after two years 
        of active duty.&quot; Joining a squadron at the Naval Air Station in Brunswick, 
        Smith helped patrol the coast on the commonly seen P-3 Orions. The Orion, 
        a large aircraft with four distinct propellers, was first used for high-altitude 
        reconnaissance in the Gulf War. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1991, after joining squadron BP-8, Smith served in the last stages 
        of Desert Storm as an in-flight electronics technician, monitoring and 
        performing maintenance on highly advanced surveillance, communication, 
        and radar equipment. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Flying at high altitudes, Smith did not see much first-hand combat, but 
        he still holds the lasting impression that we &quot;were not challenged.&quot; 
        He says, &quot;it wasn't a challenge at all, it wasn't much of a war. 
        I remember thinking that if this war was to last a long time, I don't 
        know how long America's military would be able to fight, being afraid 
        that we were to become demoralized.&quot; He found the war to be for our 
        opposition like &quot;taking a knife to a gunfight.&quot; Iraqi equipment 
        seemed &quot;outdated&quot; as &quot;they never had a chance to come off 
        the ground&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In much the same way, he points to the current lack of opposition in this 
        war of an Iraqi Air Force due to our similar technological advancements, 
        allowing the enemy no room to &quot;even think about getting off the ground.&quot; 
        He continued on the war's one-sided nature by saying that it &quot;made 
        [him] wonder what manner of person, whether its good, bad or whatever, 
        would send anyone into such a situation, whether it was right or not. 
        I didn't understand how Saddam Hussein could even ask his soldiers to 
        fight with the equipment that they had.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second part of Mr. Smith's speech began by asking, &quot;you might 
        be wondering what is the mentality of the sailor, marine, air men or soldier 
        that could kill another person. I know that some of the protests around 
        campus and around Brunswick is that it's just wrong and that you don't 
        need any other reason than its just wrong to kill.&quot; He answered by 
        stating that &quot;based on my life experience, that's where the good 
        ol' unequal American education system comes in,&quot; highlighting the 
        fact that most soldiers who give their lives overseas were &quot;not the 
        ones who went to a high school that promoted critical thinking and analysis.&quot; 
        He then pointed out that some who opposed the war &quot;probably have 
        more patriotism than many of them, but for many of the soldiers its a 
        job; in fact the only decent paying job they can get.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In spite of all this, Mr. Smith finds the incredible discrepancy in socio-economic 
        backgrounds of soldiers producing &quot;quite frankly&#133; a big pool 
        to pull from&quot;. He found soldiers of this kind less apt to question 
        orders or analyze politics, &quot;quite frankly they don't care&#133;they 
        are not trained to think why are we doing this. Many of them never have 
        developed the critical thinking skills, making them the perfect soldier, 
        not to ask questions.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In comparing two distinct thought processes, Smith analyzed the hypothetical 
        situation of moving five boxes from one side of a room to another. He 
        found while soldiers could move the boxes in 10 or 11 seconds, members 
        of a community such as those at Bowdoin would engage the activity by spending 
        &quot;25 minutes trying to figure out the most efficient way.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        While valuing both types of thought patterns, he finds a certain mentality 
        necessary for those enlisted. Speaking to the audience, Smith said, &quot;I 
        know that mentality would be very difficult for some of you to understand 
        in a place where we ask you to question everything.&quot; He says, &quot;quite 
        frankly the military is just the opposite, questioning nothing,&quot; 
        a mentality he finds already imbedded in many of the soldiers before they 
        come to the military. He finds a world of difference between the conversations 
        held at the naval air base and some of the discussions heard here at Bowdoin, 
        valuing both, yet regarding the efficiency behind a certain type of person. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the question of why we go to war, Smith pointed to intelligence information 
        that even with his &quot;top-secret clearance was not the tip of the iceberg.&quot; 
        This &quot;more than anything influences why we go to war; we can speculate 
        about oil, or a whole lot of different things, but ultimately it comes 
        down to economics.&quot; Smith felt the greatest reason for going to war 
        was the intelligence gathered and &quot;what they know about Iraq&quot;. 
        Similar to pro-war sentiments during Vietnam, Smith felt the intelligence 
        gathered at a federal level was enough to justify this war and the invasion 
        of Iraq.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The war forum will continue over the next two weeks with a much different 
        discussion on Thursday, featuring Joe Bandy, professor of sociology and 
        anthropology. Bandy will speak on &quot;Protest Movements Here and Abroad.&quot; 
        A Friday discussion featuring Congressman Tom Allen '67, who represents 
        Maine's First Congressional District, will follow. </p>
      <p align="left"> The talks have been organized by the BSG in an effort to 
        bring awareness to students through a variety of perspectives and experiences 
        surrounding the war in Iraq. For more information about upcoming events,
