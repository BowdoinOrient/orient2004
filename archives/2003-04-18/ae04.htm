            War. (Hans Law, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p align="left">Place: a motel room, a military camp in Saudi Arabia, another 
        room, the Iraqi desert. Time: Future, past, and, most importantly, present. 
        In the Heart of America, by Naomi Wallace, is a play that may be set in 
        certain times and at certain places, but its messages and themes stretch 
        across the barriers of both. Wallace's explorations of violence, the nature 
        of man, and the definition of love all reach a worldly level that undercuts 
        historical or descriptive constraints.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the Heart of America was performed at Bowdoin last weekend. The cast 
        of players was small and intimate and the seating arrangement in Wish, 
        the experimental black box theater, gave the audience a sense of involvement 
        in the story unfolding on stage. The floor was painted in colors meant 
        to mimic sand, and white drapery hung overhead that paralleled the layering 
        of time employed within the plot. Otherwise, the set was basic and plain, 
        leaving room for the actors' imaginations to contribute and build upon 
        the performers' surroundings.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The content of the play, however, left nothing to the imagination. Instead, 
        the actors seemed to spit in the face of the illusions of political correctness. 
        Part of the process of the play was imposing discomfort on an audience 
        that might have too easily been lulled into a sense of security. The psychologically-disturbing 
        still content achieved nauseating proportions. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The imaginary deserts painted on the stage easily translated into the 
        many images that had been broadcast over the past few weeks of war-torn 
        Iraq. The acts of physical and psychological violence played out on stage 
        drove the audience to the very core of the difficulties of human frailty 
        that we presently face.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Overall, the play seemed to broadcast that &quot;the past is never over,&quot; 
        &quot;what's done is often&#133;done again,&quot; and &quot;every day 
        it's any day now.&quot; From the discrimination against a pair of gay 
        lovers, to discrimination against Arabs in America, the play highlights 
        the prospect that fear and hatred may always surround such issues. Ultimately, 
        if this alienation is fed and nurtured, whether it is nursed in the dark 
        recesses of the mind or on the playgrounds of public schools, it will 
        ultimately lead to acts of horror and violence that defy the reason and 
        dignity of humankind.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Naomi Wallace was born in Prospect, Kentucky and her work has been produced 
        both in the United States and Great Britain. Her first play, The War Boys, 
        was produced by the Finborough Theatre and was nominated for Best First 
        Play by the London Finge Awards. In the Heart of America was first produced 
        in London by the Bush Theatre. It was then produced by the Long Wharf 
        Theatre in New Haven and was recently published in the March issue of 
        American Theatre. It was awarded the 1995 Susan Smith Blackburn Prize. 
        Her recent play One Flea Spare takes place in London during the Great 
        Plauge of 1665. It was commissioned by the Bush Theater and performed 
        there in October and November of 1995, which included an extended run 
        following its success.</p>
