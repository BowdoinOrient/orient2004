      <p align="left">Amidst the malaria infested islands of the Pacific Marines 
        of the First Division trained for their next mission. The environment 
        was inhospitable. As the sun beat down mercilessly and the humidity soared 
        to near one hundred percent, the men marched on in the soft soil, which 
        turned to mud with the slightest touch of rain. And in the tropics, there 
        was a lot of rain.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On one such march, Eugene Sledge remembered:</p>
      <p align="left">
        a heavy rain set in. As we plodded along Pavuvu's muddy roads, slipping 
        and sliding under the downpour, we began to feel that whoever was leading 
        the column had taken a wrong turn and that we were lost. At dusk in the 
        heavy rain, every road looked alike: a flooded trail cut deeply with ruts, 
        bordered by towering palms, winding aimlessly through the gloom.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Chilly and feeling forlorn in the deep, thick, slick mud, Sledge noticed 
        a large man walking up from the rear of the column. &quot;He walked with 
        the ease of a pedestrian on a city sidewalk.&quot; He was also quite friendly. 
        &quot;Lovely weather, isn't it, son?&quot; he asked. Soon, the two began 
        a conversation about Sledge's home and his family. &quot;As we talked 
        the gloom seemed to disappear, and I felt warm inside.&quot; The man reassured 
        the recruit that it would not rain forever and then moved on, chatting 
        with the other men ahead. The man who had stopped to speak with him was 
        an athlete and had &quot;a rare combination of intelligence, courage, 
        self-confidence, and compassion that commanded our respect and admiration.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sledge later remembered, &quot;His sincere interest in each of us as a 
        human being helped to dispel the feeling that we were just animals training 
        to fight.&quot; These were the qualities, which made him &quot;the finest 
        and most popular officer&quot; Sledge ever knew in his years as a Marine. 
        These were the qualities of the Marine captain known as &quot;Ack Ack&quot; 
        or &quot;skipper,&quot; who, in another life, had won the hearts of his 
        fellow students and teachers at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Here then was Andrew Allison Haldane of the Class of 1941. Hailing from 
        Methuen, Massachusetts, Haldane quickly made a name for himself on the 
        football field, rising to the position of captain. Elected as President 
        of the Student Council he was also voted the most popular man in his class. 
        Early in the war he received the Silver Star. But despite his strengths 
        as a leader he did not enjoy military life, commenting that, after the 
        war, he &quot;would much rather be a civilian.&quot; Wherever he went, 
        Haldane remained closely attached to Bowdoin, writing to President Sills, 
        &quot;If ever I do get back you can be sure I will visit Bowdoin for there 
        is a section of my heart set apart from the rest which carries an undying 
        love for the school + its members.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Before Haldane could return to his alma mater, however, there was one 
        more campaign to face. In preparation for the re-entry into the Philippines, 
        military planners singled out the island of Peleliu, in the Palau Islands, 
        as the next target for the First Marine Division, which counted among 
        its ranks two other Bowdoin men-Everett Parker Pope also of the Class 
        of 1941, and Paul H. Douglas, a member of the Class of 1913! </p>
      <p align="left">
        Douglas was a former college professor and when the war broke out he was 
        50-during the Battle of Peleliu someone called him, &quot;that crazy old 
        gray-headed guy.&quot; This Bowdoin graduate went to basic training at 
        Parris Island, rose to the rank of captain and earned himself a Bronze 
        Star. After the war, he would be elected to the United States Senate. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The other Bowdoin graduate who now served in the First Division as captain 
        of Company C of the First Marine Regiment was also a school prodigy. Former 
        captain of the tennis team, former president of his fraternity, a lifetime 
        class officer, and Phi Beta Kappa member, Everett P. Pope of Quincy, Massachusetts 
        had enlisted in the Marines long before Pearl Harbor. Serving with the 
        First Marine Division since Guadalcanal, he was, like Haldane, a hardened 
        and seasoned veteran by the time orders came for the troops to embark 
        for Peleliu.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Due east of the Philippines about five hundred miles lies the Palau islands, 
        the centerpiece of which was Peleliu-a six by two mile wide rock with 
        dense jungles and an inhospitable terrain. The beaches were defended not 
        just by Japanese gunners but also by sharp coral reefs, which lay just 
        below the surface-a danger to landing craft. The main goal of the assault 
        was an airfield. And then, there was also Umorbrogol Ridge the main base 
        of Japanese operations, complete with tunnels, caves, entrenched lines, 
        and 10,000 defenders.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On September 15, 1944, thousands of Marines of the First Marine Division 
        stormed the beaches. Immediately they began to receive Japanese defensive 
        fire. Casualties were high as Marines attempted to cross the deadly fire-swept 
        beach to reach the cover of the underbrush. The weather was over one hundred 
        degrees and the men were sweating heavily thanks to the humidity. Soaked 
        with salt water, splattered with sand, grease, dirt, and under fire of 
        both automatic weapons and mortars, the Marines did their best to consolidate 
        their positions on the beach. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Four days after the U.S. landing, as the First, Fifth, and Seventh Marine 
        Regiments attempted to gain their objectives, Captain Pope found himself 
        at the base of Hill 100-also known as Walt Ridge-with orders to take it. 
        The hill was an isolated knob-according the Marine Corps maps-which overlooked 
        the East Road as well as a swampy patch of ground, which the men would 
        have to pass through. As the commanding position, Hill 100 was targeted 
        and the twenty-five year old Bowdoin graduate was ordered to take his 
        ninety men and three officers up to its summit and claim the high ground. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        As the Marines made it to the foot of the hill, they began to climb the 
        steep, barren rock as enemy fire thinned their ranks. Despite the terrain 
        and the opposition about twenty-four of Pope's men made it to the summit 
        only to find that it was not the summit. Walt Ridge itself was merely 
        a part of a longer ridge, dominated by higher ground only 50 yards away. 
        Stuck in a crossfire between the dominating heights and another enemy 
        position to his west, Pope knew that he was in trouble. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Deciding to hold the ground, which had been won at great human cost, and 
        await reinforcements, Pope soon learned that none were available. As the 
        sun set, Pope and his men created what defensive works they could at the 
        summit. Isolated from the rest of the regiment and lacking sufficient 
        grenades and ammunition, Pope's men did their best as Japanese troops 
        attempted to infiltrate their lines. The enemy attacks were thrown back 
        but it was a long and horrible night.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As September 20, 1944 dawned, Pope and his remaining men were down to 
        their last rounds of ammunition and had to use rocks to hold off the attackers. 
        The fighting became hand-to-hand as the parameter was assailed with increased 
        ferocity. Enemy troops were hurled off the cliff and desperate, savage 
        fighting ensued. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Down to twelve men, Pope was finally ordered to withdraw. The men scrambled 
        down the hill, they had so desperately fought to hold as Japanese troops 
        fired after them. Of the ninety-three men who had followed Pope up the 
        Ridge the day before only nine had survived without serious injury. Pope 
        himself had been injured but refused to seek immediate medical attention. 
        His company had been decimated.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Later on in the battle for Peleliu, to the Fifth Marine Regiment's front, 
        Eugene Sledge happened upon Captain Andy Haldane at Company K command 
        post:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ack Ack [Haldane] was studying a map by the light of a tiny flashlight 
        &#133; I sat on it and watched my skipper with admiration. Never before 
        had I regretted so profoundly my lack of artistic talent and inability 
        to draw the scene before me. The tiny flashlight faintly illuminated Captain 
        Haldane's face as he studied the map. His big jaw, covered with a charcoal 
        stubble of beard, jutted out. His heavy brow wrinkled with concentration 
        just below the rim of the helmet. &#133; He requested a certain number 
        of rounds &#133; to be fired out to Company K's front. A Marine on the 
        other end of the radio questioned the need for the request. Haldane answered 
        pleasantly and firmly, &quot;Maybe so, but I want my boys to feel secure.&quot; 
        &#133; Next day I told several men what Ack Ack had said. &quot;That's 
        the skipper for you, always thinking of the troops' feelings,&quot; was 
        the way one man summed it up.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But Andy Haldane was not immortal; on October 12, 1944 as he was examining 
        the island's terrain under heavy sniper fire, he raised his head from 
        cover and a bullet found him-killing him instantly. His death was one 
        of the almost 9,000 U.S. casualties suffered in the battle for Peleliu.</p>
