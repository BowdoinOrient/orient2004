        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Celebrated each year as a national holiday on April 22, 
        Earth Day commemorates the unique relation we hold to our natural world, 
        and our consequent responsibility as stewards of a healthier environment. 
        Founded in 1970 by the Democratic Senator from Wisconsin, Gaylord Nelson, 
        Earth Day has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable happenings 
        in the history of democracy&quot; by American Heritage Magazine. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Born in Clear Lake, Wisconsin, Mr. Nelson grew up in a community of around 
        700 people, where outdoor recreation and logging rights were both issues 
        of extreme importance. His political agenda was evident from the start 
        as it is told that when he was 14 he organized a campaign to plant trees 
        beside the roads leading into his hometown. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After receiving his B.A. from San Jose State College in California in 
        1939, Nelson studied at the University of Wisconsin Law School, joining 
        the U.S. Army soon after to fight in the Okinawa campaign. After serving 
        in the State Senate as a Democrat for ten years from 1948-58, Nelson was 
        elected to Governor where he faced crucial issues surrounding a general 
        state demand for outdoor recreation. In August of '61, Nelson passed the 
        Outdoor Resources Action Program to buy land rights from private property 
        for state acquisition of parks and wetlands. </p>
      <p align="left">
        His subsequent career after being elected to the US Senate in 1962, found 
        Nelson accomplishing such environmental legislation as: the preservation 
        of our current 2,000 mile Appalachian trail, creating mandates for fuel 
        efficiency standards in automobiles, passing acts that controlled strip 
        mining in the state as well as creating a ban in the use of DDT as well 
        as other lethal agents, and finally helping to create both Wisconsin's 
        St. Croix Wild and Scenic Riverway and the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        In his own words, Nelson says, &quot;I continued to speak on environmental 
        issues to a variety of audiences in some twenty-five states. All across 
        the country, evidence of environmental degradation was appearing everywhere, 
        and everyone noticed except the political establishment. The environmental 
        issue simply was not to be found on the nation's political agenda. The 
        people were concerned, but the politicians were not.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In a political feat that still stands unrivaled in the world of environmental 
        awareness, Senator Nelson came up with the idea of Earth Day around the 
        same time as many of the so-called &quot;teach-in&quot; protests that 
        occurred during the Vietnam era. His idea for a grass-roots protest against 
        the multitude of injustices happening to the environment, came at the 
        time when the country was largely active in anti-War Demonstrations. Here 
        he describes this moment of revelation in an article published by the 
        Wilderness Society in 2000: </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;At a conference in Seattle in September 1969, I announced that in 
        the spring of 1970 there would be a nationwide grassroots demonstration 
        on behalf of the environment and invited everyone to participate. The 
        wire services carried the story from coast to coast. The response was 
        electric. . .Telegrams, letters, and telephone inquiries poured in from 
        all across the country. The American people finally had a forum to express 
        its concern about what was happening to the land, rivers, lakes, and air-and 
        they did so with spectacular exuberance.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As Bowdoin celebrates Earthweek next week starting Monday April 21 with 
        a presentation by Frank Gohlke entitled &quot;Landscape, Life, Photography, 
        and other Riddles&quot; through Friday April 25 in a Common Hour Lecture 
        by George Bandy entitled &quot;The Sustainable Campus: The Next Educational 
        Revolution,&quot; I would draw our attention to the many parallels between 
        today and the times of former Senator Nelson. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A statement recently released by the official site for International Earth 
        Day, calls for Peace and unity among mankind, it says &quot;all individuals 
        and institutions have a mutual responsibility to act as Trustees of Earth, 
        seeking the choices in ecology, economics and ethics that will eliminate 
        pollution, poverty and violence, [and] foster peaceful progress.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        A similar sentiment will be celebrated all next week through activities 
        presented in association with Evergreens and Sustainable Bowdoin, for 
        more information please look for fliers posted around campus or to the 
        student digest. </p>
