        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.<br>
        </font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Dr. Jeff: If a mutant cold virus causes SARS, does 
        that mean it's possible for a cold to turn into SARS? C.B.</p>
      <p>Dear C.B.: For most viruses, frequent genetic mutation is in fact the 
        rule, rather than the exception. The vast majority of these transformations 
        render viruses less infectious. Other mutations change proteins on the 
        outer coats of the viruses, giving them a new immunologic identity and 
        allowing them to slip undetected past our immune defences. That's why 
        we keep getting &quot;common colds,&quot; usually caused by continually 
        changing coronaviruses. The SARS coronavirus mutation, however, gave it 
        a new protein coat and made it far more dangerous.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Although more details become clearer every day about SARS, the overall 
        picture remains complex and confusing. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As of April 15, according to the World Health Organization, there have 
        been about 3,200 reported cases of probable or confirmed SARS worldwide. 
        1,418 have been in China, 1,232 in Hong Kong, 162 in Singapore, and 63 
        in Vietnam. Canada has had 100 cases (almost exclusively in Toronto), 
        and the U.S. 193. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The illness seems to act differently in different countries. The case 
        fatality rate, for instance, varies greatly.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In the U.S., there have been no deaths from SARS. In China and Hong Kong, 
        however, the case fatality rate has been about 4.5 percent. In Canada, 
        it is now 13 percent. These differences may in part reflect statistical 
        variance from the relatively small numbers involved or may raise the possibility 
        that there are different co-factors involved.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The illness clearly affects different people very differently. Authorities 
        now describe &quot;super-spreaders&quot; as people with SARS who seem 
        to infect many others around them, whether they are family members, ambulance 
        drivers, or patients in the same emergency room. In the U.S., SARS cases 
        have not &quot;clustered&quot; as much as they have in Hong Kong and Toronto, 
        and those affected by SARS have largely had relatively mild illnesses. 
        In fact, one public health official recently suggested that American SARS 
        (&quot;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome&quot;) be renamed MARS (&quot;Mild 
        Acute Respiratory Syndrome&quot;). Suspected SARS cases in the U.S. are 
        spread across 32 states, although New York and California together account 
        for one-third. It remains unknown whether or not people without symptoms 
        can harbor and spread the SARS virus (which would make them so-called 
        &quot;silent spreaders&quot;).</p>
      <p align="left">
        Scientists in Canada and the U.S. have now identified the entire 29,727-nucleotide 
        sequence of the SARS coronavirus genome. Significantly, although the specimens 
        were derived from different patients who had been infected in different 
        countries, the viral genetic codes were virtually identical. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This suggests that the SARS epidemic did in fact emerge from a common 
        source. Moreover, the whole genome is new, according to Hong Kong researchers 
        and derived not from human but from animal viral sources.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Some of SARS' epidemiologic differences may also reflect diagnostic difficulties. 
        The diagnosis of SARS remains clinical and what doctors call a &quot;diagnosis 
        of exclusion.&quot; The C.D.C. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) 
        case definition of SARS specifies that the illness have no other known 
        cause; that it include measured fever greater than 100.4 degrees, significant 
        cough, and shortness of breath; and that it begin within 10 days of travel 
        to an affected area, or within 10 days of close contact with a person 
        who has a respiratory illness, who traveled to a SARS area or who is known 
        to be a suspect SARS case.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis of SARS but only after considerable 
        delay. Antibody tests, for instance, take up to 3 weeks to complete. Hopefully 
        now that the SARS coronavirus has been definitively confirmed as the primary 
        cause of the illness and its genome fully identified, faster and more 
        accurate clinical lab tests will be developed.</p>
      <p align="left">
        At this point in the epidemic, the C.D.C and W.H.O. make the following 
        recommendations to Americans regarding prevention and travel. Noting that 
        to date, all reported cases of SARS in the U.S. have occurred after travel 
        to affected areas or through close contact with SARS patients, both agencies 
        recommend postponing non-essential travel to affected areas and using 
        appropriate protective equipment and techniques (basically masks, gowns 
        and gloves) around those suspected to have fallen ill with SARS. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In general, all of us should take care to practice basic hygiene, like 
        regular hand washing and avoiding contact with others' respiratory droplets. 
        Travel advisories are currently limited to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, 
        and Vietnam. There are no travel advisories for Toronto.</p>
      <p align="left">
        One last point to consider: it is always very frightening when a new pathogen, 
        a new illness and a new epidemic break out. Keep in mind, though, that 
        at least so far, SARS pales in comparison to far better known and far 
        more common public health threats. Influenza, which early or mild SARS 
        mimics, but which, unlike SARS is a vaccine-preventable disease, infects 
        10 to 20 percent of the entire population every year, killing some 36,000 
        Americans annually. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Drunk drivers kill over 17,000 Americans every year or nearly one person 
        every 30 minutes. A full 30 percent of all cancer deaths are caused by 
        smoking, and over one-third of people who smoke will die prematurely from 
        their use of tobacco. And more than 2,600 Americans die every day of cardiovascular 
        disease. That averages out to 1 death every 33 seconds. The majority of 
        those deaths are also premature and preventable. </p>
      <p align="left"> A great deal of information is available about SARS. The 
        Maine Bureau of Health (<a href="http://www.state.me.us/dhs/boh/ddc/indexnew.htm">www.state.me.us/dhs/boh/ddc/indexnew.htm</a>), 
        C.D.C. (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/">www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/</a>), 
        and W.H.O. (<a href="http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/">www.who.int/csr/sars/en/</a>) 
        all have web-posted information that is frequently updated. National Public 
        Radio continues to air thoughtful and well-informed discussions about 
        SARS. You can find audio archives or order transcripts on-line at <a href="http://www.npr.org">www.npr.org</a>.</p>
