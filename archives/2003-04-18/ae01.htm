      <p align="left">When visitors enter the Portland Museum of Art for the next 
        two and a half months, the first image that will greet them is &quot;Transom,&quot; 
        an installation piece by Bowdoin professor Mark Wethli. This is part of 
        the 2003 Portland Museum of Art Biennial, an exhibition that showcases 
        the work of Maine's best emerging and established contemporary artists. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The paintings, photographs, sculptures, works on paper, watercolors, installations, 
        prints, and videos in the exhibit demonstrate the diversity of artistic 
        work done by Maine artists over the past two years. </p>
      <p align="left">
        To be considered for the Biennial, artists submitted slides, an artist 
        statement, and a r&eacute;sum&eacute; that were judged by &quot;three 
        leading figures of the contemporary art world.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Of the 877 artists who submitted applications to this year's Biennial 
        only 70 were selected for the exhibit, and 10 of those artists have a 
        connection to Bowdoin. In addition to Wethli, current faculty members 
        Lucy Barber, John Bisbee, and James Mullen had pieces selected for the 
        Biennial, as well as former faculty members Anne Harris, Sarah Malakoff, 
        and Celeste Roberge, and Bowdoin alumni Steven Albert '88 and Cassie Jones 
        '01. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Among the 132 pieces of art in the exhibit hangs &quot;Candid #12,&quot; 
        a painting by Bowdoin senior Eric Legris. Remarkably, in the midst of 
        some lifelong artists in the exhibit, Legris has only been painting for 
        about two years. &quot;Mark Wethli's Painting I class sophomore year was 
        one of the best classes I've taken here,&quot; he said, about his first 
        real experience with painting. His first painting, like &quot;Candid #12,&quot; 
        was a manipulation of a candid snapshot. The manipulation became necessary 
        because his subject's head was cropped off in the photograph, so he finished 
        the painting by adding onto the top of her head from another photograph, 
        which was looking in another direction. Excited by the result of this 
        procedure, Legris says that he has been trying to recreate the ideas of 
        that first painting in all of his subsequent works.</p>
      <p align="left">
        He began carrying around a disposable camera, taking candid pictures at 
        parties, and creating paintings from those photographs. &quot;I've found 
        that in candid moments, there are spontaneous things that you don't notice 
        in everyday life that are really interesting.&quot; The process of painting 
        is just as spontaneous for Legris as the photographs he takes. &quot;The 
        reason I do things is not cognitive. It's really an intuitive process; 
        I just trust myself.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Legris believes that the Biennial is especially important for emerging 
        artists: &quot;It's basically an opportunity for unknown artists to get 
        their work into a museum. I think it's one of the most exciting things 
        the museum does.&quot; He also says he feels honored to be on the same 
        wall as Anne Harris, one of his idols.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As a part of the &quot;Meet the Artists&quot; lecture series, many of 
        the Bowdoin artists will be speaking at the Portland Museum in the coming 
        weeks. Both Mark Wethli and John Bisbee will lecture on Sunday, April 
        27, at 1:00 p.m. and Legris will be speaking on Sunday, May 4 at 1:00 
        p.m. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Portland Museum of Art Biennial will be on display from April 10 through 
        June 1. </p>
