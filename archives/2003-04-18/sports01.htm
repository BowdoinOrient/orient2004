      <p align="left">What was supposed to be a cold and rainy day turned into 
        a great day for Bowdoin Women's Track Team. Vying against the usual suspects-Colby, 
        Bates, and M.I.T-the Polar Bears debuted their spring talent and strength 
        with a strong showing against rival opponents.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Track team captain Acadia Senese '03 commented on the meet, saying, &quot;The 
        women had a strong showing today. There were many great performances. 
        The first meet of the season is always difficult, but the women showed 
        that they have what it takes to be the top in New England this season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The results had Bowdoin placing third overall. However, after discovering 
        an error in the scoring, the Bears have unofficially placed second. Even 
        though the team score may still be up for debate, we here at Bowdoin know 
        that the Bears are still number one in talent, spirit, and hotness. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Speaking of such a combination, Lynne-o &quot;the Hammer&quot; Davies 
        '04 competed in the hammer for the first time with a throw of 26.93 meters. 
        Also competing in the hammer was senior captain Cait Fowkes. Her throw 
        of 38.03 meters surpassed her previous personal best and placed her seventh 
        overall. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Fowkes also had a fabulous day in the high jump, clearing a personal best 
        height of 5'0&quot; and placing third. First-year Emily Hackert, who will 
        be competing in the heptathlon for the first time next weekend, placed 
        sixth in the high jump. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The women's 4x100 team (Kat Martens '04, Hackert, Julia Febiger '03, and 
        Sara Bodnar '03) came in second with a time of 52.52. Bodnar later smoked 
        the competition in the 100-meter dash, winning with a time of 12.95 seconds. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        First-year speedster Ruth Jacobson was not far behind with a fourth place 
        finish in 13.50. In the 100-meter hurdles, Bowdoin's Natasha Camilo '06 
        and Allison Cherry '04 took fifth and sixth place respectively.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin dominated the mid-distance events. In the open 400, Hackert took 
        first with a time of 61.9 seconds. Teammate Kat Martens finished right 
        behind her with a time of 62.2. First-year Jen Sepanara took eighth place 
        with a time of 66.5. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the 800, sophomore All-American Katie &quot;Franz-as in she will pump 
        YOU up!&quot; Walker raced to a strong finish, winning with a time of 
        2:23. Kate &quot;best kick in the NESCAC&quot; Brinkerhoff '03 outdid 
        herself once again. She came from behind to place third with a time of 
        2:26. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Davies and first-year Emily Sheffield finished seventh and eighth, respectively. 
        All four women posted times good enough to qualify for the NESCAC championship 
        meet. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the 400-meter hurdles, Febiger raced to a 65.87 first-place finish. 
        Camilo also had a great first performance in the 400 hurdles, finishing 
        sixth with a time of 74.2. In the 1500, junior Kala Hardacker fought off 
        a sore hip to come in fourth with a time of 5:04. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sophomore Ellen Beth was just behind Hardacker for the fifth-place finish, 
        and first-year Allie Yanikoski finished sixth. In the 5000-meter, sophomore 
        Mary Beth &quot;secret weapon&quot; Sexton had a fifth place finish with 
        a time of 19:36. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In other field events, Cherry jumped to sixth place in the long jump with 
        a 4.41-meter leap. Senior captain Acadia Senese had a great third-place 
        triple jump of 10.62 meters. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the pole vault, senior captain Anne Barmettler cleared 9'00&quot; for 
        third place. Sophomore Emily Pendergast vaulted to a personal best of 
        7' and earned sixth place. Barmettler said of Pendergast's vault, &quot;I 
        just knew Emily had it in her. She's always been a fast one. Plus she 
        finally penetrated [into the pit]!&quot; Additionally, Jonelle Walsh '05 
        cleared 7'6&quot; to place fourth overall.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The women's 4x400 meter relay team (made up of Yanikoski, junior Jane 
        Cullina, Sheffield, and Walker) finished second in 4:15.42. The last running 
        event of the day was the 4x800 (Davies, sophomore Molly Juhlin, Brinkerhoff, 
        and Febiger). The women ended on a high note as Febiger edged out Colby 
        in the last lap to gain the lead for first place. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Senior Libby Barney was unable to compete due to a persistently painful 
        achilles' heel, but will be back in full force on Saturday. Regarding 
        the meet at Colby, Barney said, &quot;Watching my teammates compete on 
        Saturday was an inspiration. Every one out there was competing, regardless 
        of what place they finished. I can't wait to be a part of that spirit 
        at Aloha's&quot;. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Senese said, &quot;The Bears are fired up for this weekend and will undoubtedly 
        'leave it all on the track.'&quot; So be sure to swing by the outdoor 
        track to cheer on the women's team for the first and only home meet of 
        the year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There will be loud music, leis, and Larold the lobster-what better way 
        is there to kick off your weekend? </p>
