        <font size="2">TODD BUELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> I had given up writing about smoking policies until a friend 
        slipped into my mailbox an unusual New York Times headline. It read: &quot;Bouncer 
        dies, and family blames city's smoking ban.&quot; We should keep the ramifications 
        of that headline in mind as we think about our approach to smoking here 
        at Bowdoin, and, more broadly, as the state of Maine considers a law that 
        would ban smoking in bars. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Probing into the story, one finds both inexplicable tragedy and an unexplored 
        side of intrusive regulation. A bouncer, 32 year-old Dana Blake, was murdered 
        after he told two brothers that they could not smoke at the bar. Police 
        are still investigating the details of the murder, but it is clear that 
        Blake's desire to enforce city law contributed to his death. The Times* 
        quotes Blake's brother as saying, &quot;Why does somebody have to suffer 
        because somebody wants to pass a cigarette law?&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        This death is obviously a grave loss to Blake's family. However, there 
        is also a sick irony in this death. Proponents of broad-sweeping prohibitions 
        on smoking in bars and restaurants advocate such measures in the interest 
        of employees. They ineluctably bring out medical studies and experts who 
        remind us of the perils of second-hand smoke. They argue that we cannot 
        leave decisions about smoking up to individual establishment owners because 
        it unfairly puts their employees at risk of the deleterious effects of 
        second-hand smoke. </p>
      <p align="left">
        This argument does have some merit to it. However, Blake's death in New 
        York City should reveal the other side of the debate: the financial and 
        emotional cost of enforcing such intrusive regulations. Obviously what 
        happened to Blake is an extreme case, but it exposes the cost of regulation. 
        This cost is illustrated well when examined locally in the context of 
        Bowdoin parties. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Having lived in a social house for two years, I have hosted or helped 
        organize a number of parties. A party host has many things with which 
        to concern himself: ensuring that partiers do not enter or exit with alcohol, 
        making sure that partiers have their IDs checked and their hands are marked 
        appropriately, providing non-drinkers with non-alcoholic beverages, being 
        accessible quickly in case security arrives, making sure no one gets excessively 
        intoxicated, etc. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Routinely, there were students who would smoke in the Quinby House basement. 
        As a tacit policy, we allowed students to smoke in the basement as long 
        as the smoke did not get so thick that the smoke detector was in danger 
        of being activated. The policy freed me to perform more important tasks. 
        By not having to worry about smoking, I could concentrate on my other 
        aforementioned duties as party host. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The example shows that increased regulations, like anything else, have 
        what economists call &quot;opportunity costs.&quot; Every moment that 
        one is enforcing a regulation, one is taking up time that one could spend 
        doing something else. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Currently Maine is considering a law that would ban smoking in all bars. 
        Most of the bars that I have frequented are not well staffed. They have 
        the bare minimum of wait staff, bartenders, and bouncers. Requiring these 
        busy staff members to enforce another regulation will likely make it harder 
        for them to enforce the regulations they already have to enforce-like 
        the 21 year-old drinking age. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If enforcing the regulations becomes too much of a burden, a bar will 
        either ignore them (as happens in some bars in California that I have 
        been to or heard of) or the bar will shut down-further damaging Maine's 
        economy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though one should be careful not to read too much into the circumstances 
        surrounding the tragic death of Dana Blake in New York, the incident helps 
        illustrate that perhaps not all employees will be happy to have another 
        rule that they have to enforce-even if the rule is enacted &quot;in their 
        interests.&quot; </p>
