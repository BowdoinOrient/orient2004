        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> It's been a week now, but the pictures from Baghdad's Firdos 
        Square remain fresh, the most enduring images of this television war. 
        In a scene reminiscent of the fall of communism, Iraqi men jubilantly 
        attacked a 20-foot statue of Saddam Hussein, then tore it down with American 
        help. If the mass surrenders of Iraqi troops and Iraqi civilians' joyful 
        embracing of American soldiers didn't prove it, Firdos Square's exuberant 
        eruption did: American forces came into Iraq as liberators, in every sense 
        of the word. For all the skepticism and sneers of the press, when the 
        threat of retribution was gone, Iraqis embraced their conquerors as saviors.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While everyone is patting themselves on the back and trying to ignore 
        the gloomy predictions about postwar Iraq (predictions made by the same 
        people who predicted a long, bloody war), one of the main lessons of the 
        war, and indeed of the post-9/11 world, is in danger of being lost. In 
        barely a year's time, the underfunded and outnumbered American military 
        has swept into two countries, tossed out their reprehensible rulers, and 
        begun the arduous path to peace and freedom for peoples who have never 
        known much of either. Both wars were fought for national security. No 
        one is seriously suggesting that the poorly-named Operation Iraqi Freedom 
        (couldn't we have just called it The Ninth Crusade, since Arab public 
        opinion wasn't all that supportive anyhow?) was fought mainly for Iraqi 
        freedom. But here's the thing: shouldn't it have been?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Our America is in an almost unprecedented position. Even Victorian Britain 
        and Imperial Rome didn't have the kind of overwhelming military and economic 
        dominance we now possess. As former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan 
        noted, the US is not a superpower, but a &quot;hyperpower.&quot; The threats 
        of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction remain very real, but we 
        are nonetheless in a unique position to positively shape the course of 
        world history. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Freed from the harsh strategic imperatives of the Cold War, the need to 
        compromise with dictators and thugs is gone. The time for a moral American 
        foreign policy, the antithesis of the cold realpolitik of Europe, is now. 
        This war has proved that we don't need the corrupt and helpless United 
        Nations to accomplish anything; in fact, the UN is a hindrance to both 
        American aims and the spread of democracy and freedom. President Bush 
        bravely ignored the weight of world opinion, and the anti-American peace 
        movement that weeps for Iraqi children but couldn't care less about starvation 
        in Zimbabwe or ethnic strife in Nigeria. As a result, we have one of the 
        most impressive military victories in history, a tyrant dead or on the 
        run, and the liberation of a people who had endured decades of the most 
        brutal repression. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the coming months, we have the opportunity to do far more. The White 
        House is already making threatening noises toward Syria, another repressive 
        secular Muslim state with tastes in terrorists and chemical weapons. The 
        regime in Iran should realize that its days are similarly numbered, and 
        the Saudis are going to have to finally and unequivocally choose sides 
        in the war on terror.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The real test, though, will come when American security and prosperity 
        are not at stake. When doing what is best for the world means confronting 
        Israel about its brutal treatment of the Palestinians. When doing what 
        is right means spending American money and American lives to end a decades-long 
        civil war in the Sudan, the only country that still practices slavery. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        At this moment, we have, if not the obligation, then at least the opportunity 
        to be a powerful force for social and political change, which unfortunately 
        sounds like something out of a Sixties protest manual. No one else is 
        going to take on this task; the Europeans were willing to passively watch 
        genocide occur in their own backyard until the US intervened in Bosnia. 
        America would be doing the world a great service if we took up, as Rudyard 
        Kipling put it in far less politically correct times, &quot;the white 
        man's burden.&quot; I don't mean the imperialism or the racism inherent 
        in the phrase, only the evangelical, crusading spirit that it embodies. 
        If we can even just look past forty years of leftist deconstructionism, 
        and admit to ourselves that our values and our system of government are 
        universally good things, we will have taken a vital step towards bettering 
        the planet. The next step is offering the poor and the oppressed of the 
        world the blessings we enjoy.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Do I honestly believe this is the course our nation will take in its foreign 
        policy? No. We live in the richest country on earth, but it is a country 
        that devotes a mere .5 percent of its federal budget, the smallest percentage 
        in the industrialized world, to foreign aid. And even though 80 percent 
        of this already paltry sum goes directly to American companies, politicians 
        routinely summon up foreign aid as an example of wasted money. As shown 
        in Black Hawk Down, we also live in a country where eighteen dead soldiers 
        were enough for us to stop feeding the starving masses of Somalia. An 
        American foreign policy with morality as its central plank seems unlikely. 
        Nonetheless, a Pax Americana for this young century would be a truly worthy 
        goal. </p>
