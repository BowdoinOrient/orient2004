        year's Bowdoin Posse to hear what they had to say about their experiences 
        with Posse and Bowdoin. We spoke to Lenz Cerlot Balan '04 from Cambridge, 
        MA; Marie Jo Felix '04 from Boston, MA; Lauren Marie Flinn '04 from Boston, 
        MA; and Omega Ann-Marie Roberts '04 from Dorchester, MA. Here are their

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>First impressions and expectations of Bowdoin and 
        how they have changed: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenz: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>I had never heard of Bowdoin. I wanted to go to 
        Morehouse or BC. I wanted to be in the city. But it was a good school, 
        a chance to get a good education for free…I didn't worry about culture 
        shock because I went to BC High, a school that was 96 percent white.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:</b> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not looking at Bowdoin at all. Nothing about Maine 
        attracted me…I was hearing stuff like it was so hard [and] you're gonna 
        be feeling like you have so much to do, and I was like, "Oh gosh." And 
        they were telling me it's a small campus, and I was like, "Oh gosh." And 
        they were telling me it's in Maine, and I was like, "OH GOSH!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I came to Bowdoin and it was everything I was "Oh 
        goshing" about…but, you see, the one thing about myself is that I tend 
        to assimilate into my environment and make the best of it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were expecting kind of a very homogeneous setting. 
        I don't think so much we were expecting people to be outwardly racist 
        or anything, but we were expecting people to be like, "Oh my god, I never 
        realized that." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it's true in some aspects, but then in some aspects, 
        it's like we're the same as everybody else…I think my view of this place 
        has changed a lot…At first I was like it's okay; I guess I'll go if I 
        have to. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now its different because we are also learning about 
        places where we don't come from…it's working both ways.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to visit. I liked the small classes, but it was 
        not my setting. I thought I wanted to go to a big school. The Posse thing 
        made me reconsider it. I love the school; I love the people. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Experiences with the Screening Process<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenz:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kind of nervous, but I wasn't too worried because 
        it seemed so unlikely. I looked at it like trying to date Jennifer Lopez. 
        Towards the end, I began to feel more confident; I began to think I might 
        get it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting picked was so hard. I'm usually very confident…and 
        so I went to the second round which is the one-on-one interview, and I 
        was like, "Oh no, what should I do? What should I say?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, of course, I went in wearing a pink boa and was 
        all dressed in pink…and apparently the pink boa worked. In the final round, 
        I did not think I performed to the Marie Jo status, and I was like, "Oh, 
        I didn't get it…." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they called and said, "Yes, you got it," I was 
        like, "Oh my gosh!"…and I ran outside U-Mass Boston, and I got up, and 
        I was doing cartwheels all over the place, and everybody was rooting for 
        me…so that was a really big surprise.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't say it was stressful, because it was nothing 
        like anyone has ever done before…it's not how smart you are, it's not 
        anything but who you are-you can't do anything but be yourself….But it 
        was so much fun. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were so many people there. Those students were 
        brilliant. I was like, "Omega, walk out; don't come back. You're not gonna 
        get this." It was very challenging. We had a critical analysis workshop. 
        We had to work together as a group-I was nervous, I didn't speak up a 
        lot, I was so quiet.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Thoughts on training in Boston and the ongoing 
        meetings at Bowdoin College<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenz:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You really get to know people. One of the tutors was 
        a lawyer from Boston who had graduated from Bowdoin. He helped me with 
        my writing and he showed me what was possible with a Bowdoin education.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Posse, we train to deal with culture shock; we train 
        to deal with the academic blow…we knew what to expect.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It teaches you tolerance and how to handle yourself 
        in some situations instead of going off the handle….There have been situations 
        here where if I hadn't gone through Posse, I would have flipped out. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned to take a step back and be like, "Okay, where 
        are these people coming from?" [The weekly meetings are] just a place 
        to kind of go-its like a family…you go to family dinner on Sunday-its 
        kind of like what it is-just hanging out and seeing how everyone's doing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior year was already pretty tough…then you walk 
        in [to the training sessions in Boston], and you feel tired and depressed 
        and leave feeling uplifted. We all share similar experiences. You actually 
        bond with these students!</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Pressures and Expectations from Posse <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Lenz:</b> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never felt a lot of pressure from Posse. All of the 
        pressure on me comes from my family. My father has always attempted to 
        make me ambitious. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first I was worried about pressure…but at the beginning 
        of college it sort of went away. They just said focus on your academics 
        and the rest will come because of who you are. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no pressure from Posse. Being the first Posse 
        out of Boston is very exciting. For expectations, they're just like, "Do 
        as good as you can do, and we're fine with that because you're just gonna 
        be awesome being the person that you are-that's why we chose you…just 
        because of who you are, you are gonna make a difference. Your presence 
        in a classroom and your ideas and stuff are gonna prevail over everything 
        else." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kind of worried, thinking, what are they gonna 
        expect from us? You get here and realize we set our own limits. The biggest 
        expectation is that we all graduate. We're the pioneers. Back in Boston, 
        we got a lot of publicity, attention, support. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>How has Posse changed your experience? What would 
        it be like without it?</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lenz:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support I've gotten from Wil Smith has been huge. 
        He recommended me to take Eddie Glaude, who's great…Knowing you have a 
        group that knows you, knows what you are about, what annoys you, what 
        you like, helps.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Posse totally helped because those are the people 
        I can connect to…I know they are going through the same thing I am going 
        through: academic-wise, culture shock, and all those other things. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Posse really helped me in that if I get uncomfortable, 
        which I haven't yet, academically or socially, there's always a place 
        for me to go…I just think it's great. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>I don't think I'd be here if it weren't for Posse….[Coming 
        to Bowdoin] was just such a shock to me….It's hard…when it seems like 
        everyone else around you is so much more above you; you get so frustrated. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they go on winter break, they are going to the 
        Virgin Islands for six weeks, and I'm like, "Oh I'm getting three jobs." 
        It took me a really long time to settle in and find a niche….If I didn't 
        have [the Posse members], I would have been lost. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted, I am white, but I don't come from a high class 
        background. I went to public school in the city, and as much as I'm not 
        the same color as [the other Posse members], I'm on the same level as 
        them in a lot of other ways. A lot of people don't really understand that. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I would have been struggling more. I wouldn't 
        know about the support systems we have now; I wouldn't take advantage 
        of them. [The Posse members] all have the same dreams, the same goals. 
        We've had hard experiences, been through a lot of struggles. Now we're 
        turning it into something positive. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Thoughts on diversity and the level of acceptance 
        at Bowdoin<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenz:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin has made me more open….I went to BC High, a 
        school that was 95 percent white. In high school, I mostly hung out with 
        Black and Latino kids. Here, a lot of my friends are white. I've made 
        really good friends; people I would not have normally been friends with. 
        I've found the kids at Bowdoin to be open and nice and cool. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Marie Jo:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see too much diversity, which I knew because 
        one of the purposes of Posse was to bring diversity--not just diversity, 
        but active diversity….People on this campus want diversity. They want 
        to understand other peoples' cultures, want to understand where they're 
        from. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's okay for you not to have seen certain things, but 
        if you are curious enough to come and ask me, that's fine, and that's 
        one of the things I like about Bowdoin. It might seem to other people 
        that, "Oh, they are just being racial," but its really not….I see it as 
        them being curious. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Lauren:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's diverse in a lot of ways….On a level of race and 
        stuff like that, it's not. Everyone I've come in contact with has been 
        very accepting and [they] really want to learn and kind of care…and they 
        honestly admit that they have these views about people and you can talk 
        to them about it, and they'll be like, "Oh yeah, thanks for telling me 
        that because I didn't know that." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Omega:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not very diverse, but the good thing about it is 
        the school is making great strides to diversify the campus….It's changed 
        the way I view a lot of things, the way I view race. Everything is not 
        a race issue; you can't point [race] out when you see it. </p>
