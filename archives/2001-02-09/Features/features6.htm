      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia, South Carolina, was filled with mass hysteria. 
        For four years, banks had sent valuables for safekeeping. Government documents 
        were stored in its vaults. Precious possessions for thousands of Southerners 
        were pilled high in houses, mansions and numerous buildings. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia seemed to be a safe haven from the distant 
        guns of war. But in February of 1865, a few months short of the end of 
        the War, refugees began to pour in from the surrounding countryside. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of old men and young women, followed by slaves 
        and wagons filled with personal effects, cramped in the city's streets 
        as word of Federal atrocities began to circulate. Columbia, the very cradle 
        of succession, was in turmoil, and only one name was being mentioned and 
        cursed over and over again-Sherman. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman was coming. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since William Tecumseh Sherman's armies had successfully 
        marched from occupied Atlanta to the sea at Savannah, the entire south 
        had been wondering what he would do next. They soon found out. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had with him sixty thousand veterans who were longing 
        to teach South Carolina never again to defy the might of the Union. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the middle of February, Oliver Howard's Army of the 
        Tennessee was within range of Columbia. His skirmishers had sharp fights 
        with Confederate cavalrymen, which were the only obstacles that stood 
        in his way. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Howard had almost come full circle. At the beginning 
        of the War, he had taken command of a regiment in Maine and fought at 
        Bull Run. Now, after numerous fights in the East, and being sent West 
        to join Sherman, he was on his way back to Virginia with the rest of Sherman's 
        troops, looking forward to finally defeating Robert E. Lee.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his immediate goal, Howard had no trouble in 
        taking Columbia. The rebels, outnumbered and out-gunned, had no choice 
        but to retreat, leaving the populace to the wrath of Sherman's eager troopers. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All along the road to Columbia, they had been heard 
        singing, "Hail Columbia, happy land, if I don't burn you, I'll be damned." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 17, Sherman rode into Columbia with Howard. 
        Sherman assured the mayor that "your city is safe in my hands as if you 
        had controlled it." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Howard sent in a brigade to patrol the streets 
        while the rest of the troops made camp outside the city. The brigade chosen, 
        as veteran as they were, soon succumbed to the barrels of liquor lying 
        around. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freed slaves brought drinks from mansions and showed 
        their liberators around. Soon the brigade was dead drunk and began the 
        transformation from soldiers to arsonists. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sherman retired for the day, hoping to get some sleep, 
        he saw the city burning. The troops no longer had any control. Officers 
        were unable to halt their men as they began to set fire to the bales of 
        cotton that the rebels had left behind. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses were looted, pillaged, and destroyed. Fire spread 
        along streets, blocks, and markets. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the McCord house, where Howard had set up headquarters, 
        the men threw in burning cotton, not taking note that their own commander 
        was resting. Howard had the fires put out and reportedly commented that 
        he was amazed at how the burning cotton was flying everywhere. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman himself was out in the streets, trying to put 
        out the fires with all the men he could get. Howard, by then, had brought 
        in another brigade to help the situation, but the second brigade, instead 
        of helping the situation, added to the confusion. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, Howard had to bring a whole division to 
        restore order. By dawn of February 18, Columbia was in ruins. Sherman 
        wrote that he was sorry to see the city nearly destroyed, but he admitted 
        that he believed the South Carolinians had gotten what they deserved. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a few days, he was moving again, northward towards 
        Goldsboro, his destination where another twenty thousand men would add 
        to his already gigantic force. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of the previous marches, however, began 
        to lag. The roads were muddy, the days were filled with rain, and the 
        rivers were swollen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite Sherman's work details, he moved at almost a 
        snail's pace. It took him almost a month to near his destination. And 
        all that time had been well spent by the rebels concentrating in his front.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 16, Joseph Johnston's Confederate Army, one 
        third the size of Sherman's combined might, attacked the Federal left 
        wing under General Henry W. Slocum at Averasboro. Slocum brushed the opposition 
        aside and moved on. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 19, Johnston struck again, this time hard enough 
        for Sherman to order Howard's other column, now far ahead of Slocum's, 
        to retrace his steps and come up in support. The Battle of Bentonville 
        was to be the final fight of the Western armies, fought as it was on the 
        East Coast. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard had little to do except to reinforce Slocum who 
        was soon left alone when Johnston retreated in the face of overwhelming 
        numbers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman's armies did not pursue Johnston but instead 
        went onto Goldsboro where reinforcements lifted their strength to almost 
        ninety thousand men of all arms. Sherman was now unstoppable.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was to be no major fight. Johnston readily 
        agreed to an armistice after Lee surrendered to Grant on April 15. Outside 
        Raleigh, North Carolina, Sherman and Johnston met for the first time to 
        agree on terms of surrender which Sherman's superiors rejected. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting again on April 26, this time with Howard as 
        a participant, the two warring parties came together to end the war. Johnston 
        surrendered his army, and the Civil War, for Oliver Howard and his men, 
        ended.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legacy of the War, however, was just beginning. 
        On April 17, Howard received word from Washington that President Lincoln, 
        his friend and Commander-in-Chief was dead, the victim of an assassin's 
        bullet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in mourning for his president, Howard received 
        word that he should report to the Secretary of War as soon as he could. 
        It had long been Lincoln's wish, Secretary Edwin Stanton said, for Howard 
        to head the Freedman's Bureau. Now that the War was won, the task of healing 
        the nation was setting in. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with Lincoln's death, the task would be much more 
        difficult. He had held the nation together, and he was the one with the 
        plan and the power to let it heal without retaliation. Freed slaves needed 
        help with the transition to liberty, and Lincoln had intended for Howard, 
        the army's good "Christian soldier" to head the effort, imparting his 
        love for humanity into this delicate process. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newly sworn-in President Andrew Johnson also voiced 
        his approval, and Howard accepted the office with an eye towards fulfilling 
        Lincoln's wish for peace. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman voiced his concern over Howard's acceptance 
        of the position. "I hardly know whether to congratulate you or not," he 
        wrote, saying that Howard had his full confidence, but the task before 
        him was Herculean in size. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "God has limited the power of man, and though in the 
        kindness of your heart you would alleviate all the ills of humanity, it 
        is not in your power…It is simply impracticable." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman ended by saying that the choice had been a good 
        one, and if anyone was right for the job, it was Howard. In two years, 
        Sherman had come to respect and depend on Howard as a friend and a comrade. 
        And now, he did a great honor for the Maine general.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 24, during the Grand Review of the Union armies, 
        thousands of men, women, and children crowded Pennsylvania Avenue to watch 
        as the victorious soldiers paraded in tight formations, waving their flags, 
        for a second or two forgetting the horrors of the War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the head of the column, Oliver Howard, veteran of 
        five years of cruel war, rode with William Tecumseh Sherman down the road 
        paved with glory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Otis Howard had emerged from the War as a hero 
        and with a reputation as a "Christian soldier." Years later, in a correspondence, 
        Howard wrote about his dual role of being both a peace-seeking Christian, 
        and a war-waging soldier:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I would labor as earnestly and industriously as any 
        one to secure to my country peace. And really how well the officers and 
        soldiers performed their part during the war! It was dreadful; it was 
        more terrible than you can depict, and yet I believe sent upon us as really 
        by divine direction as was any one of the battles under Joshua. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have never, since I loved Christ, hated an enemy; 
        no more do I hate a man who is to suffer death according to law; but protection 
        to our country needs an army… Let us have peace, but let us be true to 
        our present duty, while we hope, labor, and pray that our duties may be 
        changed by the general diffusion of the principles of peace… <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I do daily pray for my enemies, and endeavor to entertain 
        for them a forgiving spirit. The men I fought were, many of them, my intimate 
        personal friends. I never hated them; I grieved that they raised their 
        hands to destroy their government."<br>
