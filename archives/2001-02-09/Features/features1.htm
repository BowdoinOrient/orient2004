      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin Giggey, a senior here at Bowdoin, took on a new 
        project last semester. Having packed up her rubber boots and grungy pants, 
        she headed with a small group to the New Meadows River. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With proper digging tools and sterile containers, Giggey, 
        along with her fellow students, collected mud samples from the bottom 
        of the brackish river. The mud, filled with biological organisms, was 
        then taken back to a lab and analyzed in order to gauge the health of 
        the river. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, such a complicated geological study would 
        be reserved for career scientists, but due to small budgets and a lack 
        of qualified workers, small research organizations have begun to bring 
        in college students like Erin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The New Meadows Watershed Steering Committee, the organization 
        teamed with Giggey's group, wasn't the only benefactor from this partnership. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin students, often foreign to Maine and daunted 
        by its vastness, have little opportunity to interact with its interesting 
        culture and non-tourist sites. Rarely would an entire class of college 
        students, be assigned to interact with the community and make a helpful 
        contribution. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seniors such as Giggey, who are majoring in biology, 
        time in the traditional Bowdoin labs practicing predictable experiments 
        has become stagnant. When asked what she thought about working on the 
        New Meadows River, Giggey simply replied, "Refreshing." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Learning, the title for this strategy of class 
        dynamic of involvement, was introduced to Bowdoin this year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already in practice at Bates and Colby, service learning 
        inevitably was brought to Bowdoin by several determined and eager geology 
        and biology professors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After rigorous planning and much effort, thirteen partnerships 
        were created with local scientific research organizations for three geology 
        classes-Marine Environmental Geology, Intro Environmental Geology, and 
        Geology Field Methods. Containing 63 students, the three courses were 
        partnered to such organizations as the Friends of Casco Bay and the Brunswick 
        Sewer District.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin wearily took on the idea, skeptical of its overall 
        effectiveness in teaching students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cathryn Fields, the coordinator for the service learning 
        program, identified the two goals of the program as "community involvement 
        and academics." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American Association for Higher Education released 
        a book in 1999 entitled "Acting Locally: Concepts and Models for Service 
        Learning in Environmental Studies" which analyzed service learning. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It commented on the college bubble, not unknown to Bowdoin, 
        by stating, "Many of these students [involved in service learning] see 
        no reason to become acquainted with their host communities. Service Learning 
        can take such students out of their academic shelter." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project, The Effects of Tidal Restrictions at 
        the Eastern Road on Scarborough Marsh, involved eight students who traveled 
        45 miles south of Brunswick to take peat core samples to determine the 
        health and makeup of the biologically vital marsh. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teamed with the Maine Audubon Society, the students 
        assembled facts to help them plan future strategies for protection of 
        the marsh.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elliot Jacobs '04, along with seven other Bowdoin students, 
        worked on the Juvenile Lobster Substrate Survey to the help the Lobster 
        Conservancy evaluate habitat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By gridding a given area and looking for specific lobster 
        habitat, the student research team also compliled data that could be useful 
        to the Conservancy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacobs commented on the project by saying, "We never 
        really concluded anything." Both Giggey and Jacobs light-heartedly referred 
        to themselves as "brunt laborers." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the service learning groups compiled their findings, 
        they were required to construct an informative poster for their class 
        and the community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They were more impressed than I thought they would 
        be," said Giggey when asked about the community's reaction to their work. 
        Another poster session will be held for the public on May 9.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service learning has continued this semester in Hydrogeology, 
        Tectonics, Marine Geology, and Aquatic Ecosystems. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future of the program is undetermined, though. The 
        success of these two semesters determines the program's continuation and 
        growth into other departments. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin stated, "In my opinion, it is important for service 
        learning courses to be a part of the liberal arts experience." </p>
