      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON-Despite my newly discovered love for literature, 
        I remained true, at least for the time being, to my youthful dream of 
        going into politics once I returned to Germany. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing this, Hal Tucker, as the Chaplain's assistant, 
        one day invited me to give a chapel talk, something equivalent I suppose-though 
        I may be wrong-to today's Common Hour. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those days, chapel attendance was mandatory, not 
        on a daily basis, but so many times a semester, and checked at the door. 
        This meant that chapel speakers-usually the Chaplain, but occasionally 
        members of the faculty or students-had the full house, as it were. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my subject, I chose "Franco-German Reconciliation." 
        The text of my talk, given on April 7, 1955, was a week later reproduced 
        in full in the <i>Orient</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having earlier this year been kindly sent a photocopy 
        of it by Sean Monahan of the Library's Special Archives Department-Sean 
        wishing me a "happy trip down memory lane"-and with the present <i>Orient</i> 
        editors' permission, I'd like to quote from it here in a minute. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having to speak in public-a thought that now terrifies 
        me-at 19 held no terror for me. Confidently facing the expectant faces 
        of my peers on tiered seats on either side of the chapel's middle aisle, 
        as in the House of Commons, I began as follows: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ten days ago, on a warm spring day in Paris, the French 
        Senate quietly made history. After five years of nervous waiting and painful 
        discussion, a decision has been reached that may mean a turning-point 
        in the history of Europe. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although with the arrival of spring and a vacation 
        just behind us, only an idealistic professor could expect you to be interested 
        in turning-points of European history, this event is worth a national 
        holiday, or at least a chapel talk."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French Senate, I explained, had just ratified the 
        so-called London and Paris Treaties which provided for German rearmament, 
        with our new armed forces to be fully integrated into NATO and the Western 
        European Union, now the EU, vastly expanded. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an historic decision, I said, because ever 
        since the partitions following Charlemagne's death of his Empire in 843 
        and 870, France and Germany had quarreled over disputed areas: French 
        armies had invaded Germany, German armies France. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the creation of the Western European Union, I said, 
        a thousand-year history of almost perpetual strife had finally come to 
        an end. Adding, in a tone of voice making me sound like I was already 
        a German Ambassador in Washington, that Franco-German reconciliation and 
        cooperation were vital if Europe were to survive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists had nearly wrecked the EDC-project last 
        year, I said, Europe's "darkest hour since the war." But "a free and strong 
        Europe" was necessary for the defence of the western world "against Communism." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostility between the French and the Germans, I asserted, 
        wrongly was considered traditional or even natural. Nothing could be "falser 
        than that. However, I am completely aware of the great emotional and psychological 
        difficulties that still stand in the way of German friendship, not only 
        with France but with many other countries, too. Great wrong has been done, 
        and unspeakable misery has been inflicted upon the whole world." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing for effect like an accomplished parliamentary 
        speaker, with the student audience gone so quiet one could have heard 
        the proverbial pin drop, I continued by slowly and deliberately stating 
        the following: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The murdered millions have not been forgotten and should 
        not be forgotten. To forgive does not mean to forget, and to understand 
        not to excuse. Yet true friendship can only be based on forgiveness and 
        understanding." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pin was heard to drop, so I continued. "Many people 
        may not know that, or may not want it. But there are a few in every country 
        who do. They have a moral obligation to work together and stand together. 
        All of us who have the privilege of getting an excellent education belong 
        to this group."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bringing my oration to a conclusion, I said, with a 
        slight tremor in my voice:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The great mass of the German people may not have changed 
        as much as you think they should--that can only take place in a gradual 
        process. But I know that there are many who feel responsible for what 
        has happened in the past and who want to make sure that it never happens 
        again." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was greeted, after a moment of respectful, almost 
        stunned silence, with strong and long applause. As the students filed 
        out, members of the faculty present, led by Professors Brown and Whiteside, 
        came up to shake my hand, murmuring a few appreciative words or just looking 
        me gratefully in the eye. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among those giving voice to their approval was old "Fritzi" 
        Koelln, head of the German Department. With his square head and ruddy 
        features, Fritzi looked, as noted before, like the stereotypical Hollywood 
        German. I represented the new Germany he told me, clasping my hand in 
        both of his. Koelln's praise, I later noted in my diary, meant more to 
        me than anything. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the fraternity, I was warmly congratulated by 
        my friends. This is your day, I guess, Kent Hobby said--capped that afternoon 
        by my driver's test, which I passed with flying colors. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Orient</i>, then still with an eight-column front 
        page, ran my talk beginning at the top of column five, and placed between 
        a report on one by Herbie Brown, facetiously titled "The Awful Twenties," 
        and the headline, extending over three columns, "Boards Officially Approve 
        Construction of Rink" (at an "estimated cost of approximately $250,000"). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An artist's impression showed how the planned structure, 
        long and low with a gracefully curved roof, even with pines drawn in, 
        might eventually look. The Hockey Rink is as familiar to you as any other 
        building on campus, regardless of its age. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same issue, it was announced that Louis Coxe, 
        "outstanding young American poet and playwright," had been appointed professor 
        of English, succeeding the late Robert Peter Tristam Coffin, "for twenty 
        years Pierce Professor of English." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Louis couldn't have been more different from Old 
        Herbie. I never really got on with him, nor he with me. In my last year, 
        Robert Frost, a really great poet, came on a visit to Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a reading in Sills Hall, Frost attended a reception 
        arranged by the English department, to which students were also invited, 
        but I was too shy to talk to him. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among my favorite lines of his are: "The Woods are lovely, 
        dark and deep/but I have miles and miles to go before I sleep." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old friend Rosemary, as fond of poetry as my new 
        friend Robert Morrison, used to quote them to me, somewhat wistfully, 
        long before she knew I would one day return to her and England. </p>
