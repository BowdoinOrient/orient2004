      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to complications, the completion of a brand-new 
        Astroturf playing field at Farley Field House has been postponed until 
        the spring. The construction of the turf, which had proceeded normally 
        since its beginning in the fall, hit a snag during the final stages, when 
        the top layer of turf would not stick to the adhesive sublayers below.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Jeffrey Ward, the Ashmead White Director 
        of Athletics, "the initial planning and permitting took longer than we 
        had anticipated, so the project didn't get started until the fall." However, 
        when the town of Brunswick granted the school the needed permits, construction 
        began on the new turf in the beginning of October.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems with the turf were noticed in December, 
        with the placement of the top and final layer of turf. Instead of laying 
        flat as it normally should, the turf rippled and bubbled at various places 
        along the surface. The turf was removed, but because of the incoming cold 
        weather, the continuation of the job was postponed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Cullen, an assistant director of athletics, said 
        he believes that there could have been two possible causes of the problems 
        in the final stage of the turf construction. Either the cold weather did 
        not allow the turf to properly adhere to the sublayer, or problems with 
        the sublayer itself did not allow the turf to stick to it. Squares of 
        the turf were removed and sent for analysis to determine the exact cause 
        of the problems.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were all chomping at the bit, waiting for the turf 
        to be completed," he said. "However, because of all the sports starting 
        in the spring, we have to fit everything into our scheduled times. It's 
        jam-packed." In order to prevent conflicts among sports practices, field 
        reservations and schedules must be carefully planned. In some cases, this 
        leads to some sports practicing late at night, when slots are available.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire athletic department anticipated the completion 
        of the turf before winter break. "If the field were completed today," 
        said Cullen, "we would have had that field plowed and playable, even in 
        thirty-degree weather." The turf had been planned to be used as a practice 
        field for some sports, such as lacrosse, and as a competition site for 
        others such as field hockey.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the project has not been proceeding as planned, 
        Ward is still enthusiastic about the completion. "While the spring teams 
        would all like to be using the turf field this winter, they are essentially 
        in the same situation they were in last year. The field house never had 
        turf in it, but it is one of the best around." </p>
