      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Student Executive Board has been busy bringing 
        new services to the student body. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After months of deliberation, Bowdoin Security and Student 
        Government have reached a resolution to the parking situation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two groups have acknowledged the need for a staff 
        member to work exclusively on parking at Bowdoin next year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Executive Board met with Bruce Boucher, 
        director of Security, and Dean Bradley to discuss changes after analyzing 
        data collected last semester during the on-going parking review. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two student government representatives to the Parking 
        Appeals Committee have been chosen; these students will be working with 
        Richard A. Yanok, Security's parking officer, to review parking appeals.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase communication between student government 
        and the student body, the Executive Board has decided to set up a student 
        government table in the Union, where representatives will begin meeting 
        with students to keep them updated and to receive student feedback. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEB will continue to poll students on its webpage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board is also inaugurating the Student Government 
        Discussion Series on Tuesday, February 13 to attract members of the Bowdoin 
        community to engage in constructive discussion. The topic of the first 
        forum will be the house system. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next sponsored Common Hour Campus Cross-Talk is 
        scheduled for March 2, when Wil Smith '00, coordinator of multicultural 
        student programs, will be talking about college admissions policies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspaper pilot program will continue through March 
        2 with papers available in Chamberlain Hall, Coles Tower, Moulton Union, 
        Baxter, and Thorne.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SEB also started up the online photo directory at 
        the start of this semester. Though this addition to the online directory 
        faced a few initial problems, Jeff Favolise, chair of the Student Executive 
        Board, said that he has only received good feedback about the photos; 
        sometimes the directory site is so busy that students cannot even access 
        it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 24-hour study space has also been established in Moulton 
        Union.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Board has recommended the following improvements 
        to CIS: links at the top of the digest to eliminate scrolling; buttons 
        next to the subjects and above each message so messages can be opened 
        in another window for printing and saving; and a twice-a-day digest to 
        accommodate students who miss the first deadline. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board is also working to pass a bill that would 
        give the community the day off before Thanksgiving and is addressing concerns 
        about class sizes. </p>
