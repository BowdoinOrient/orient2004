      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin is not known for its diversity. In fact, like 
        many small liberal arts colleges, Bowdoin is often cited as a "J. Crew" 
        campus. With the introduction of the Posse program, however, Bowdoin is 
        changing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For thirteen years, The Posse Foundation has offered 
        urban public school students the opportunity to attend selective colleges 
        and universities. In addition to receiving an excellent education, these 
        students bring diverse experiences and strong leadership skills to their 
        college communities. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin's first real experience with these students 
        came last year as ten Posse students from Boston entered the Class of 
        2004. Due to the success of the Posse, Bowdoin has already selected Posse 
        members for the Class of 2005.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a program such as the Posse group has been 
        apparent for years. Trustees, alumni, faculty, and students have been 
        concerned with the lack of racial and socioeconomic diversity at Bowdoin. 
        For a long time the admissions office has been trying to strengthen efforts 
        to recruit minority students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs Wil Smith 
        '00, explained that the traditional recruitment tactics were not working. 
        Part of the problem was that all of the top colleges and universities 
        were competing for the same select group of students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of these students, the prospect of going to 
        a small, fairly homogenous school in Maine was not appealing. Furthermore, 
        Smith explained that many of the minority students were being sought out 
        simply because they "looked different," not because they brought a "different 
        perspective to the classroom." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In aiming to enhance the Bowdoin community, the College 
        was not only looking to raise the percentage of minority students, but 
        also to bring students of different experiences into the classroom and 
        into Bowdoin's social scene. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting off at Vanderbilt University, Posse has found 
        enormous success at Middlebury, Leihigh, DePaul, Rice, and Wheaton. Bowdoin 
        was impressed by Posse's reputation as the top talent-seeking program 
        and made the decision to select Posse students from the Boston area.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posse is a highly selective, need-blind scholarship 
        program. Many people do not realize that it is not solely a scholarship 
        for minorities but instead focuses on reaching a wide range of urban public 
        school students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The applicant pool last year for Bowdoin started out 
        with a pool of over 300 applicants who all excelled academically and as 
        leaders. Each applicant was recommended by a teacher, principal or leader 
        from his or her community. After narrowing the pool down to twenty-five 
        students, Bowdoin joined in the selection process. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Posse calls their recruitment efforts the "dynamic assessment 
        process." Smith said, "picking the ten finalists was one of the hardest 
        things I've ever experienced." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pick the final ten students, the Posse recruiters, 
        Bowdoin admissions officers, and other members of the Bowdoin community 
        went down to Boston. In this intensive screening process, they focused 
        on the individual qualities of the applicants as well as their group dynamic. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most Bowdoin first years who begin their college 
        experience in August, the Posse begins meeting in January. They meet once 
        a week and participate in several different workshops emphasizing leadership, 
        writing, teamwork, and cross-cultural communication. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their training continues throughout the year and is 
        run primarily by Smith, who acts as their mentor. This training includes 
        weekly, two-hour group meetings run either by Smith or by members of the 
        group. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith explains that these meetings focus on whatever 
        is on the students' mind. Some of the issues covered include culture shock, 
        time management, and the dating scene at Bowdoin. Each member also has 
        a biweekly individual meeting with Smith. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this ongoing training is to both aid 
        the transition into the Bowdoin community and to help the Posse members 
        reach their potential. The Posse motto is to affect the campus, the community, 
        and the world. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith elaborated by saying, "We are producing leaders…these 
        students will continue to lead by virtue of their individual, dynamic 
        personalities." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin is already feeling the effects of the Posse 
        program. This year's first-year class is the most diverse class ever, 
        with minority students constituting eighteen percent of the group. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith explained that the presence of Posse is already 
        helping to attract more diversity to Bowdoin. At Bowdoin's annual minority 
        recruitment weekend, The Bowdoin Experience, in April, minority students 
        were encouraged by Bowdoin's obvious commitment to diversity and by the 
        understanding that there were already ten minority students coming in 
        the fall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major concerns originally voiced by Bowdoin 
        students and faculty about the Posse program was that other students would 
        feel excluded from this established group. Many expressed concerns that 
        Posse would be a segregated group on campus, and other minorities might 
        feel left out or overlooked. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith said that this question of segregation or cliques 
        is an institutional question at all colleges. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Posse members have branched out into the community, 
        though, much of this criticism has dissipated. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith also emphasized that Posse members should be looked 
        at as individuals. "They are all very different people; they are all leaders 
        in their own right." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Posse has been a great success, Smith hopes 
        that his office will be able to reach even more students in the future. 
        He does not think that other minority students feel excluded, but he does 
        wish that there were more support systems intact for them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I reach a fair amount of them, but there are those 
        that slip through," he said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smith said that he is very excited about the future 
        of diversity at Bowdoin, and that he believes Bowdoin did the right thing. 
        "The school was ready for [Posse]. The timing was right…the school was 
        asking the right questions, and they did the right thing." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin is already committed to the Posse program for 
        at least the next two years. Smith's hope is that Posse "will influence 
        the environment such that Bowdoin will become an attractive place for 
        students of color." </p>
