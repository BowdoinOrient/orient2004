      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you've had a week like I've had, all you want to do this 
        weekend is party like a rock star. Maybe that isn't an option for you, 
        but the Film Society can help. This weekend, we are presenting a series 
        of Rock and Roll crossovers: films with rock stars doing what they do 
        best, being rock stars. On Friday night, we have a special treat. February 
        9 marks the 37th anniversary of the Beatles' appearance on the Ed Sullivan 
        Show. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; To commemorate the event, Audrey (the biggest Beatles fan 
        I know) made sure she got to choose the films we show. Good choices, I'd 
        say. As for Saturday night, we wanted to show Rock and Roll High School 
        with the Ramones and Cool as Ice with Vanilla Ice, but we couldn't get 
        a copy of either. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This is a real shame, because everyone needs to see Cool 
        as Ice; you have no idea how good it is. But the films we do have are 
        good substitutes. As always, the movies will be shown in Smith Auditorium, 
        Sills Hall, and are free and open to the public.<br>

        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp; A Hard Day's Night</i> (1964) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Richard Lester <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Starring: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Ringo Starr <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This film takes place at the height of Beatlemania, and stars 
        the Fab Four as themselves. What the film tries to do is shows you, the 
        obsessed fan, what a "normal" day in the life of the Beatles is like. 
        Somehow, I don't think it was this crazy. The soundtrack features some 
        great songs, including: I Should Have Known Better, Can't Buy Me Love, 
        and the title track. The formula for this film was used in Spice World, 
        but somehow I doubt it was as good. Then again, Meat Loaf is in Spice 
        World… <b>Rated G </b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Help</i>! (1965) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Richard Lester <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Starring: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Ringo Starr <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; OK, so if A <i>Hard Day's Night</i> was an attempt to show 
        what the Beatles' life was like, I have no idea what they were trying 
        to do with this film. Ringo happens to put on a ring that was once owned 
        by the victim of a religious cult that believes in human sacrifice. Since 
        Ringo has the ring, he needs to be the cult's next victim. I haven't seen 
        this movie, but apparently there are also some mad scientists and a member 
        of a spin-off cult after the Beatles, plus some police who are trying 
        to help. Sounds pretty silly to me, but I'm betting it will be good. The 
        soundtrack features: You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, Ticket to Ride, 
        Yesterday and the title track. <b>Rated G </b></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i> (1983) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: D.A. Pennebaker <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Starring: David Bowie, Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Mick Woodmansy, Angela Bowie <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Recorded on July 3, 1973, this film documents the final appearance 
        of David Bowie's alter ego Ziggy Stardust, and his backing band, the Spiders 
        from Mars. There are some outlandish and amusing costumes, and the backstage 
        segments are pretty neat. Songs include: Ziggy Stardust, Watch that Man, 
        Changes, Space Oddity, Let's Spend the Night Together, Suffragette City 
        and Rock 'n' Roll Suicide. A pretty good setlist, even if it doesn't include 
        those classic vocals "I'm David Bowie, I'm David Bowie, look at me goey!" 
        It is said that this film is only for true Bowie fans, but come on, who 
        isn't a Bowie fan? <b>Rated PG </b></p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 Motels</i> (1971) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Tony Palmer and Frank Zappa <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Starring: Frank Zappa, the Mothers of Invention, Keith Moon, 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Ringo Starr <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There's not much to say about this movie other than it is 
        extremely weird. But it's made by Frank Zappa, what else would you expect? 
        Although there is little to no plot, the film is a group of true stories 
        about what occurred to the Mothers while on tour. As FZ says in the opening 
        of the film: "Touring can make you crazy, ladies and gentlemen. That's 
        what 200 Motels is all about." I think that about sums it up. If you feel 
        your life is too mundane, come see this film. <b>Rated R </b></p>
