      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently nothing is funnier or more interesting at Bowdoin 
        College than the Hypothetical Situation. It consumes all lunch, dinner, 
        and late night conversations without fail. What is the Hypothetical Situation? 
        Well, it is simply thinking about things that could never happen but would 
        be anywhere from mildly to extremely humorous if they did.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the master of Hypothetics himself, my friend 
        Flan Schwack, has come up with millions. Here is a sampling: "OK, guys, 
        if pitted against each other, who would win: the Woolly Mammoth with three 
        legs or a T-Rex with no teeth?" Sometimes such questions are answered 
        with a simple and appropriate "Shut up, Flan," but more often than not 
        such questions spawn an entire argument that becomes ever more complicated 
        and intense as time wastes away. <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp; <b>Boy1</b>: "So, uh, has the Woolly Mammoth learned to deal with 
        his three-legged-ness or did it, like, just get cut off? 'Cause, like, 
        I'm asking if this guy can run at, like, full speed, or is he gonna start 
        going and then on that fourth step just wipe out?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Flan</b>: "Um, I think he's always had just three legs." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Boy1</b>: "Dude, then I totally go with the Mammoth. He's 
        got like tusks and shit." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Boy2</b>: "No, but yo. Don't underestimate the power 
        of the T-Rex's mighty jaw, teeth or no. He gets a hold of that Mammoth's 
        face and just starts wailin' on him with his big claw-feet. That's it. 
        T-Rex wins." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Boy1</b>: "No, dude, you're leaving out the tusk-factor. 
        The T-Rex is all like "Yo Mammoth, I'm comin' at you with my mighty jaw!' 
        and then ba-pow! A tusk right in the face. It'd be all over, yo." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This would continue for an entire dinner conversation, everyone 
        putting in their two cents, completely ignoring the impossibility of it 
        all. It's just trying to figure out which situation is less impossible, 
        even though one might think that impossible doesn't really have degrees. 
        If it's impossible, well, it's not possible. That doesn't mean "sort of 
        possible." It's more of a "not at all possible" kind of deal. "Im" suggests, 
        to me at least , "no, not, nah bro', negatory, etc…"But such rational 
        thoughts are irrelevant during the Hypothetical Situation game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This week, as we sat at dinner marveling at the blizzard 
        outside, instead of "You guys, look at how beautiful that is, don't you 
        love New England sometimes?" someone piped in with "Whoa, wouldn't it 
        be cool if when the weather-man called for six inches of snow, it just 
        all came down at once in one big sheet?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This was followed by a respectful and ponderous silence, 
        filled with unspoken 'whoa's and 'dude's. We all imagined to ourselves 
        "The forecast for today calls for six inches of snow," and then thunk. 
        Six inches. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Then the silence was broken by that thoughtful yet crazy 
        Zurth Wellison: "Whoa, do you think we would have developed cone-shaped 
        heads so that if you were outside when it happened it wouldn't hurt so 
        bad?" Do we laugh at Zurth? No. No we do not, because in the Hypothetical 
        Situation game, such ridiculousness is only met with more ridiculousness. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "No man, I bet we would have become a subterranean people, 
        living underground out of fear of the unpredictable and deadly snow up 
        there. Like ants."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Then the Girl's contribution, always concerned for the well 
        being of the Hypothetical characters involved: "Oh no! What would happen 
        to the birds? Do they get hit by the sheet of snow and then come raining 
        down to earth? Or do they get stuck in the snow and we wouldn't even know 
        they were there until the snow melted. Or if we got, like, three inches 
        of snow, you could see pieces of them sticking out…you wouldn't have to 
        wait until the snow melted…sorry guys. That was gross."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the conversation always takes a turn for the disgusting. 
        Oh god, one time the hypothetical situation was (and read no further is 
        you don't want to hear the grossest thing ever) "Would you, for fifty 
        thousand dollars, dive face first into a dumpster full of mutilated hamsters?" 
        I'm sorry I've shared that with you, but if Flan Schwack is going to subject 
        me to his Hypothetics, then the rest of you are coming with me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It's been said, now and then, that college is about academics. 
        Others refute this assertion and take a Good Will Hunting-esque stance, 
        which is to say, education can be found in your local library, and therefore 
        college is about the people you meet and the experiences you have. I however 
        strongly believe that college is about the hypothetical situation, and 
        the hypothetical situation alone. </p>
