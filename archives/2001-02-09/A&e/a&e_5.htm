      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm at the Café getting a cup of coffee before class, 
        when Professor Tricia Welsch, the film studies department herself, stops 
        me and tells me I'm cheap. How dare I waste my time reviewing low-rate 
        movies, when instead I could watch something of merit and actually contribute 
        some worthwhile criticism. I thought I had addressed this issue in last 
        week's column. I was running late for a class and I did not have time 
        to defend myself. My argument is this: sure, I could review a film of 
        great quality, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, one of the most wildly 
        magnificent films to come out this year, but a lot of other people have 
        already commented on how good they think it is. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Why bother writing a review of Crouching Tiger for a college 
        newspaper when you can just pick up a copy of The New Yorker and read 
        a review far more insightful and informed than anything I could write? 
        And who wants to read straightforward criticism in the college newspaper 
        when the majority of the criticism we have to read for classes is so convoluted 
        and steeped in indecipherable academic mumbo-jumbo to begin with? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; No, I'm not going there, at least not in this paper. My job 
        is to entertain and make people laugh with dick jokes (I bet you're snickering 
        already, it's just that easy. Dick jokes.) I'll save the real criticism 
        for an English paper. I'm tired of acting smart. Sometimes it just feels 
        good to be stupid. When I write a review of the latest straight-to-video 
        Andrew Dice Clay featurette, I'm fairly confident that I am the only person 
        whose written a single word about it, and it gives a chance for my readers 
        to experience the movie without having to watch the wretched thing. And 
        speaking of Dice, let's get on to the film.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever It Takes stars Andrew Dice Clay, the long-forgotten 
        '80s comedian famous for such mock nursery rhyme humor as "Little Miss 
        Muffet sat on a tuffet, eating her curds and whey. Along came a spider 
        who sat down beside her and said, 'What's in the bowl, bitch?' Oh!" Hearing 
        jokes like that again takes me back to my childhood and reminds me of 
        the time my cousin stuck a 2 Live Crew tape in his Teddy Ruxpin doll. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Dice man plays an under-cover investigator whose partner 
        is played by Don "The Dragon" Wilson. I guess Don Wilson was jealous of 
        The Dice man's ultra cool nick- name, and gave himself one as well. The 
        film opens with images of women's butts as they lift weights. Next thing 
        I know, the screen says "Two Weeks Ago," and we're inside a car with Dice 
        and "The Dragon." Dice is shouting expletives at his ex-wife over a cell 
        phone. He hangs up. "You need to be more sensitive towards women," the 
        Dragon tells him. "They have different needs than we do." He's talking 
        to Andrew Dice Clay.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Our dynamic duo, Crouching Dice and Hidden The Dragon, find 
        themselves inside a warehouse where they are about to bust a major drug 
        dealer. But before the deal goes down, the slimy drug dealer's ex-girlfriend 
        shows up with her 13-year-old daughter. The ex-girlfriend is "jonesing 
        for a fix," but she doesn't have any money. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The drug dealer will give her a hit in exchange for sex with 
        her daughter. Of course, there's only one response any good mother would 
        have, "April honey, now you be mamma's good little girl, you be nice to 
        him and remember to mind your manners." The Dragon is disgusted and blows 
        his cover. A shoot-out ensues, and the thirteen-year-old girl gets shot. 
        Fade-out to black.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It's the present, and the Dragon is still haunted by the 
        young girl's death. He and Dice have just been given a new assignment, 
        to bust the largest steroid dealer around, Paulie. Paulie distributes 
        steroids and human growth hormone to athletes all over the country. "We 
        got athletes crawling up our assholes for this stuff," he boasts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The Dragon joins a local weightlifting club where he knows 
        that Paulie's distributors hang out. There he befriends a female bodybuilding 
        trainer. Steamy romance soon follows. While in the gym locker room, one 
        of Paulie's muscle-bound henchmen offers the Dragon some steroids. "No 
        thanks, I heard it makes your dick fall off," he says. "You better watch 
        yourself little man, 'cause that's bullshit. You wanna take a peak?" The 
        muscle-bound freak takes off his leotard, fade out to black. Just kidding. 
        The Dragon tells him that he has connections and can deal the stuff to 
        pro teams back east. Soon enough, the Dragon is working from the inside, 
        getting closer and closer to busting Paulie."This is going way too fast," 
        says one of the agents to Dice, voicing his trepidation about the impending 
        bust. "Everything goes way too fast for you. When did you actually cop 
        your first feel, your golden wedding anniversary?" jests the Dice man. 
        "Aww, f*ck you!" retorts the agent. "No f*ck you," Dice responds. "Awww, 
        f*ck you in the ear!" "F*ck you." "F*ck you." "No, f*ck you!" And so on 
        and so forth.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Dragon gets more and more involved with his 
        trainer, Marla. Little does he know, she's accidentally blown his cover, 
        and Paulie's really mad. The Dragon introduces Dice to Marla. "She is 
        fantastic!" the Dice man exclaims just as Marla starts up her car. BABOOM! 
        Marla blows up.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Now Dice and the Dragon are really ticked off, so they hunt 
        down Paulie and his men. They shoot a lot of big guns and punch each other 
        until Paulie and his gang are no more. The movie ends with the Dice man 
        telling us that he doesn't like farmers because they are stupid and wear 
        overalls. The End. Survey says: B+. See you next week.</p>
