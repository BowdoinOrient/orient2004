      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Extravaganza. According to the ever-helpful Webster's, the 
        word means "something extravagant." However, for many of us, it seems 
        to fairly ooze symbolic meaning: when we think of an extravaganza, we 
        think, "feast for the senses." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; We normally don't associate frozen wastelands, a.k.a. Brunswick 
        in February, with anything close to a multi-sensory smorgasbord of delights. 
        This Saturday night will change that stereotype for good.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In case you haven't been paying attention, or looking up 
        from time to time when you're in the Union, this Saturday night in Morrell 
        Lounge will be the extravaganza of the year: the Up 'Til Dawn all-campus 
        party to benefit St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The event, which will run from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., is 
        the culmination of a year-long fundraising effort by a group of students 
        dedicated to raising awareness-and money-for St. Jude. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The idea behind St. Jude is simple, yet rarely put into practice: 
        help those in need without asking for anything in return. Located in Memphis, 
        Tennessee, St. Jude functions as both a research and treatment hospital 
        entirely focused on childhood illnesses. What makes this hospital unique 
        is the fact that not a single patient must pay for the treatment that 
        he or she receives at St. Jude. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As an entirely pro bono organization, St. Jude provides free 
        medical services to its patients and their families. The hospital even 
        goes as far as to provide for travel expenses and housing if a family 
        cannot afford to make the trek to Memphis.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As a research facility, St. Jude draws from some of the most 
        prominent minds in several fields of medicine. Their staff boasts a 1996 
        Nobel laureate in medicine, Peter C. Doherty, now head of immunology at 
        St. Jude. The research and method protocols developed at St. Jude are 
        freely shared with hospitals around the country and world, and children 
        from literally anywhere are eligible to receive treatment.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In talking to Cabul Mehta '03, executive director of Up 'Til 
        Dawn at Bowdoin, it became clear that this is no ordinary fundraising 
        effort. It is an endeavor of monumental proportions. Mehta was first introduced 
        to UTD and St. Jude in the spring of last year, when a campus-wide email 
        went out calling for a group of students to lead the event's organization 
        at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Although his original intention was not to head up the project, 
        Mehta decided to accept the position and attended a conference in June 
        for executive directors. He began assembling his team (coincidentally, 
        all sophomores) as soon as school started in September, and was immediately 
        impressed by their enthusiasm and desire to work with the community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The group was highly conscious of the scale of such an undertaking, 
        as well as its implications for fundraising at the school in general. 
        Bowdoin is the first college in all of New England to participate in UTD, 
        and schools such as Dartmouth and Holy Cross are using this year's event 
        as a model for their own plans. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; According to Mehta, the Up 'Til Dawn party itself took off 
        as a fundraiser in the south, where students would be sponsored for staying 
        up all night. The idea behind the event is one of empathy: through the 
        event, students show their support for the parents of sick children who 
        really must stay up all night at the hospital. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday's party will be the culmination of the team's year-long 
        efforts. Last semester was highlighted by a tasty bake sale, a holiday 
        card-making table at Sunsplash, and the infamous Penny Wars, which heated 
        things up considerably among the social houses. Tomorrow night's schedule 
        of events will be as follows:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 9:00 p.m.-Bachelor/Bachelorette auction <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 10:00 p.m.-Performance by Soulive and DJ Logic <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; 1:00 a.m.-Improvabilities Later on-Allen Gingrich '03 spins 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        Throughout the evening, there will be plenty of opportunities to help 
        St. Jude. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; A raffle will be held for a round trip plane ticket to anywhere 
        in the U.S., and T-shirts will be on sale all night. Donations will be 
        gratefully accepted, but Mehta stresses that the event is "completely 
        free of charge."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; While members of the Executive Board have done the large 
        majority of the work themselves, they have also received help from several 
        campus organizations. The Campus Activities Board provided assistance 
        by bringing Soulive and DJ Logic to Bowdoin for the event, and Dining 
        Services has been an enormous boon to the group. "Jon Wiley of dining 
        services has done so much for us; I just can't thank him enough," says 
        Cabul. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He has also been very impressed with the group's commitment 
        to the venture: "The board has been amazing. They have really taken this 
        project above and beyond what I ever imagined it would be." Board members 
        too have been excited to see the effect of the event on the campus. Alison 
        Banks '03, internal assistant director of Up 'Til Dawn, says, "It's made 
        me realize that raising $1,000 isn't that hard. It's great that a campus 
        this size can raise so much money for such an incredible cause."<br>
