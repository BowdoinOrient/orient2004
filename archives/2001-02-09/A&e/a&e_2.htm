      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While most of us were already home for winter break, our 
        friendly neighborhood video rental store was taken over… again. On December 
        21, Video Galaxy sold eight of its stores to Movie Gallery, including 
        the one on Maine Street. This came as a result of Video Galaxy filing 
        for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy back in August. We now have just as many Movie 
        Galleries here in Brunswick as we have Dunkin Donuts, three. Personally, 
        I'd choose to get my doughnuts from Frosty's, but I don't eat doughnuts 
        much.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I do, however, watch a heck of a lot of movies, and the store 
        that used to be Video Galaxy, which used to be the very cool Matt and 
        Dave's Video Venture, was my movie equivalent to Frosty's, except without 
        the born-again Christian stuff. For those of you who are too young to 
        remember ("I was exploring the galaxy while you were still in diapers."), 
        the Brunswick Video Galaxy store used to be Matt and Dave's Video Venture, 
        a very funky independent establishment that was known for its exceptional 
        taste in obscure movies, altered movie posters, special deals, and wooden 
        nickels to be redeemed for free rentals.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; It had a similar independent flair that Bull Moose has, except 
        the people that worked there were more of the alterna-nerd type instead 
        of the alterna-punk type; much more mild-mannered and without as many 
        piercings and/or body art.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Stores like these are what make Maine Street such a good 
        place. Without Frosty's, Grand City Variety, Bull Moose, Gulf of Maine, 
        and several others, our town would be a far less interesting place. So 
        what changes will occur because of the take over?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The biggest concern is whether or not the selection of movies 
        will change. It had been rumored that if some of their older films did 
        not rent frequently enough, Movie Gallery would make the store get rid 
        of them, in order to make way for 50 more copies of Dude, Where's My Car? 
        My source, who wishes to remain anonymous since Movie Gallery might place 
        a severed horse head in his bed while he sleeps, assured me that the store 
        "will not get rid of the current selection." My source, let's call him 
        Pat for argument's sake, did inform me that there is indeed a dress code 
        for employees which consists of "either a red, burgundy, or white polo 
        shirt, and khaki pants." Employees are not encouraged to wear items of 
        flair (Office Space reference, come on people!). Most unfortunate of all 
        is that the newest New Releases (now known as Hot New Releases. The box 
        has a picture of flames on it. Ouch! Now that's hot.) are $3.98 for one 
        night, and 99 cents for each additional night. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Another down-side to the recent take-over is that employees 
        can't show movies in the store anymore, but instead must watch promo reels, 
        which include coming attractions for movies like Dude, Where's My Car? 
        and encourage us to rent Dude, Where's My Car? the video game for either 
        the Playstation or Nintendo 64. Pat says that the store will try to show 
        a movie in between each promo reel for as long as the store can get away 
        with it. So how could the store get caught not following the rules?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "There is a district manager," Pat told me. The district 
        manager then reports to a regional manager, who then reports to the Movie 
        Gallery people in Alabama, who in turn report to Satan, ensuring that 
        the Dark Lord's scheme of renting out every copy of Dude, Where's My Car? 
        is carried out.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So what are the pluses of this take-over? Pat explained to 
        me that the original store developed a very loyal niche in the video rental 
        market that exists here in Brunswick. The clientele has since stayed faithful 
        when the store was Video Galaxy, and in all likelihood will remain faithful 
        as it becomes Movie Gallery. Pat asserts that the change is definitely 
        for the good of the store, since Video Galaxy was not so good about paying 
        its bills. Under Movie Gallery, the store will have the funds to make 
        repairs, pay the rent, and get more videos and DVDs. As far as the atmosphere 
        of the store is concerned, even though two employees left as a direct 
        result of the take-over, the staff should remain a fun bunch, and the 
        different movie categories and staff film reviews should remain in place. 
        "I hope that Movie Gallery can retain as much as it can of what made Matt 
        and Dave's so successful," said Pat. We are all hoping.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So what does this mean to alterna-nerds and alterna-punks 
        like us? Well, unless you feel like driving to Portland and renting from 
        Video Port, I'd suggest sticking with Matt and Dave's/ Video Galaxy/ Movie 
        Gallery on Maine Street. In some very small way, it has managed to retain 
        some of its original charm, which ends up being buckets more personality 
        than any other video store in the area. So until Bull Moose Music gets 
        bought by Tower Records, make mine Maine Street (Marvel Comics reference, 
        only nerds like myself would get this one).</p>
