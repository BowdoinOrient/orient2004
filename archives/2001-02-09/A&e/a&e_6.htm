      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This weekend treat yourself to a fairly infrequent occurrence 
        here at Bowdoin: the appearance on campus of a professional jazz trio, 
        led by Steve Grover. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Jazz fans all over campus, as well as those of you who are 
        not presently jazz fans but have enjoyed the past performances of Joshua 
        Redman, Natraj, and the handful of others that have come here in the past 
        few years, will be wonderfully pleased to hear that Steve Grover will 
        be bringing his acoustic piano trio to campus. Grover, adjunct instructor 
        of drums here at the College, will perform in Gibson Hall Room 101 this 
        Saturday night at 7:30. The trio is made up of Grover on drums, Chris 
        Van Voorst Van Beest on bass, and Frank Carlberg on piano. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Their music is deeply rooted in the age- old (i.e. going 
        back at least to the fifties or sixties) jazz piano tradition, and they 
        include among their principle influences Thelonius Monk, Bud Powell, Bill 
        Evans, and Paul Bley. Each of these musicians, according to the press 
        release, anyway, imbues "the music with a conceptual and formal variety 
        that lends a uniqueness to its expression." Saturday's performance will 
        probably be made up of some of these old time standards as well as some 
        original compositions.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The trio itself is made up of terrifically accomplished musicians. 
        Grover himself has been leading bands since the mid-80s and won the Thelonius 
        Monk Jazz Composition Competition in 1994 as well as JAZZIS magazine's 
        "Percussion on Fire" talent search. Frank Carlberg got his master's degree 
        from the New England Conservatory of music where he teaches now. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In 1992 he won the Cognac Hennesey Jazz Search. Finally, 
        Chris Van Voorst Van Beest is one of jazz's up-and-comers and is quickly 
        becoming the most sought-after bassist in New England. Given Gibson Hall's 
        rather intimate setting, this show should certainly be something to see. 
        Any jazzers and jazz-curious students on campus have no real excuse for 
        not coming.</p>
