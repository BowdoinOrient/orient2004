      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After it became evident that the Articles of Confederation 
        of 1777 were ineffective in governing a nation, John Adams addressed the 
        problem: "The evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1787, a new form of constitution was born which embodied 
        both democratic values and a stronger central government. Whether by design 
        or coincidence, capitalism has been integrally connected to American democracy 
        since its conception in the eighteenth-century. The economic drive to 
        maximize profits has carried over to nearly every major American institution, 
        including athletics. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the excessive flow of capital in professional 
        sports today, the big four - basketball, football, baseball, and hockey 
        - are suffering. Unfortunately, it appears that the problems of these 
        four will not be diminished any time soon. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start with basketball. The huge influx of players 
        who skip all or some part of college has aversely affected the college 
        program as well as the NBA.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of watching Quentin Richardson blossom into 
        a dominant NCAA player and refine his skills, we get to watch him struggle 
        with the Clippers. Instead of watching Corey Maggete lead Duke to an NCAA 
        title (which they will get anyway), we saw him complain of bad pedicures 
        last year with the Magic. Darius Miles? Another Clipper who can jump over 
        the gym, but bypassed college completely to struggle in the pros.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other notables include Chauncey Billups, who left the 
        University of Colorado after his sophomore year, and Jermaine O'Neal, 
        center for the Indiana Pacers. Billups has bounced around from team to 
        team, never quite living up to his potential. O'Neal is now developing 
        into a force for Indiana, but it took him four years to mature in the 
        NBA. He is now 22.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to this widespread, premature leap from amateur 
        to professional ball, the college game is subject to constant turnover 
        which makes it virtually impossible to watch a collegiate super star reach 
        his prime as an amateur athlete. Instead, when a player shows promise, 
        the incentives to become an instant millionaire are too strong to stay 
        in college, or even attend. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Carolina's Joseph Forte is one of the best collegiate 
        basketball players in the country, but according current trends, the chances 
        of him staying another year or two are very slim. Let's face it: If someone 
        offered you over a million bucks to leave Bowdoin, wouldn't you?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Football is suffering from the same ills as basketball. 
        My argument here can be summed up in two words: Michael Vick. Virginia 
        Tech's explosive, strong-armed quarterback is bypassing his last two years 
        in school and will likely be the first pick in the draft. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Vick has all the tools to be an NFL great, 
        very few quarterbacks can enter the league as a 20-year-old and expect 
        to be a starting quarterback.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those that do usually struggle mightily. This past year, 
        Vick battled injury and took his chance to jump to the NFL for the competition, 
        thefame, and the money. Unfortunately for the fans, we will not see Vick 
        in anything other than a preseason game for the next two years most likely.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the college game is hurting due to early departures 
        by players like Vick, the NFL has never had more young talent. Daunte 
        Culpepper, Donovan McNabb, Brian Griese, Randy Moss, and Peyton Manning 
        are just a few young pros who will be stars throughout the next decade. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, however, there is a clear void of veteran 
        leadership in the NFL. Jerry Rice is contemplating retirement, while Dan 
        Marino, John Elway, Marcus Allen, and Jim Kelly are already swinging the 
        golf clubs. Additionally, due to the continued expansion in the NFL, the 
        quality of players has been diluted. As a result, teams like the Ravens 
        and Giants can end up playing in a Super Bowl. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to spark the public's attention, the XFL was 
        recently created in an attempt to challenge the supremacy of football. 
        Vince McMahon is hoping that sex and violence continue to sell.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike football and basketball, baseball is suffering 
        from a far different plight. Collegiate baseball amounts to little more 
        than a home-run derby featuring aluminum bats. It is very rare for a college 
        ballplayer to jump from school to the Major Leagues due to the huge gapin 
        talent. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, baseball teams shell out millions of dollars 
        to 18-22 year old kids who show potential. They then watch them blossom-or 
        flounder-in the Minor Leagues for a few years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truly talented ones make it pro, and the others 
        spend their careers in the Purgatory of baseball-the Minor Leagues.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is truly devastating the competitive nature of 
        Major League Baseball is the outrageous cost to be a pennant-contending 
        ball club.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rockies, the most active team on the free agent 
        market next to the Texas Rangers, spent $180.3 million to sign four free 
        agents, including the $100 million Mike Hampton. The Rangers gave Alex 
        Rodriguez, one of the best shortstops in the Majors, a quarter of a billion 
        dollars. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Manny Ramirez signed a $100 million+ deal with 
        the Red Sox. In fact, Ramirez's average of $20 million per season is larger 
        than the entire Minnesota Twins payroll of $16 million.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to this insane escalation of prices for free agents, 
        few teams can legitimately challenge for the World Series. The teams with 
        the highest payrolls, the Yankees, Braves, Mets, and now the Rockies (among 
        others),are the only teams that have a shot to make some noise in October. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Twins, Royals, Expos, and the rest of the teams 
        with shallow pockets draw small crowds and are rejected by free agents 
        due to their inability to compete financially with bigger markets. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the season even begins, half the teams in the 
        majors already know that they have no chance -not this year, not next 
        year, or the year after that.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what about hockey? How could I speak poorly of 
        hockey right now with the return of Mario Lemieux? While hockey is beginning 
        to suffer from some of the same ills as baseball with owners who are willing 
        to sacrifice their financial well-being in order to bring in a championship 
        team, the problems are not as widespread or catastrophic-at least not 
        yet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Canadian hockey teams, such as the former Quebec 
        Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets, were forced to move their teams due to the 
        financial strains. As in baseball, salaries continue to escalate and many 
        teams remain uncompetitive for this reason.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fans across the nation will always be loyal to their 
        home teams, believe when they shouldn't, and tune into the prime time 
        games. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicarious nature and pure excitement of professional 
        and collegiate sports will never die, but if these current trends continue, 
        the quality, wonder, and awe of everyone's home team will continue to 
        erode. The excess of money will be the ruin, or the remaking, of collegiate 
        and professional sports. </p>
