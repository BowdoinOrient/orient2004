      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever wondered what kind of a guy is under 20 pounds 
        of equipment back there in the net during men's hockey games? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout an up-and-down season of sorts, Bowdoin goaltender 
        and captain Colin Robinson '01 has been steady in the net, mitigating 
        some of the Bears' tougher opponents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I've played fairly consistently the whole season," 
        Robinson said. He has the most career shutouts (six) in Bowdoin hockey 
        history, and could take the top spot in career wins with two more victories.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's been able to separate himself as a player and 
        a captain," head coach Terry Meagher said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's not been easy in our league, with a team as young 
        as we have. In the early going, he showed wonderful leadership."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher indicated that Robinson and fellow senior Alex 
        Tatum have helped the younger players learn the ropes this season. "Both 
        captains have contrasting personalities, and they really balance each 
        other out," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a limited position in terms of mobility, Robinson 
        has been a valuable team leader. "In between periods and in practices, 
        he's been very effective," Meagher said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First-year Chris Pelletier agrees. "He's got a lot of 
        experience and game advice; even though he's in the goal, he carries a 
        lot of weight," he said. "There is a lot of respect for him on the team."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We've had some ups and downs; on one night we can play 
        great defensive hockey, and the next night, not play defensive hockey 
        but score some goals," stated Robinson. "It's been hard not knowing which 
        'team' is going to show up."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A season including some big wins and a few disappointing 
        losses has shaped Colin's leadership style. "It's really been interesting 
        just being a captain, especially on such a young team," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With all that it takes to make everyone get up for 
        every game, it's been a real new dynamic this year."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colin said that a family member sparked his liking of 
        the game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My stepmother got me interested; she was a hockey fan 
        and took me out skating on a pond once." It seems to be history from there. 
        "I was always a goalie," he added.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing all four of his Bowdoin years, Robinson has 
        come a long way from freshman year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He's gotten a lot better; he's gotten solid in all 
        parts of his game," Coach Meagher said. "He will play in big games and 
        not get nervous; he doesn't beat himself. That's been his key over his 
        career." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of goaltending, in being "responsible" 
        for a game's score, seems to motivate Robinson. "I do feed off the pressure," 
        he said. "And I like the idea that you're only as good as your last game 
        or last save."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many other hockey players, Robinson has some superstitions 
        he's kept. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still get dressed the same way before games; I always 
        put things on left to right," he admitted. When asked about his sports-related 
        role models, Robinson revealed yet another superstition of sorts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I love Patrick Roy, who now plays for the Colorado 
        Avalanche," he said. "I've actually carried his card in my wallet since 
        1992."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hockey may or may not be in Robinson's future. "I haven't 
        decided yet," he said. "I'm kind of taking it one step at a time. It's 
        a matter of whether I'd like to stay in North America and play, or I may 
        get into the work force."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, hockey seems to have been a positive, valuable 
        activity for Robinson. "I've loved it, being able to walk in here as a 
        freshman and start right from the beginning," he said, "It's been a wonderful 
        experience." </p>
