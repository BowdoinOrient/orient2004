      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men's Indoor Track team added to their winning record 
        at a three-college meet in New London, Connecticut, where they defeated 
        both Coast Guard Academy and Connecticut College.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite a four-and-one-half hour drive on the morning 
        of the meet, the Bowdoin men were at their best. "I was pleased that we 
        handled a long road trip like a group of veterans. We didn't sulk or complain; 
        we prepared and executed," said Captain Steve Allison '01. The team may 
        have competed like hardened veterans, but the majority of the point scorers 
        were freshmen and sophomores.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Wilkins '04 won the high jump event, clearing 
        6'04.75'', while Dan Abraham '04 finished a close second in the long jump 
        with a leap of 19'11.75''. Abraham also won the 55m high hurdles, followed 
        by second-place finisher, Jesse Cargill '03. The swift sophomore sprinters, 
        Jeff Manganaro and Chris Davidson, finished first and second in the 55m 
        dash.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle distance events were dominated by the Polar 
        Bears. Rob Mandle '02 and Phil Webster '04 took the first two spots in 
        the 600m, both running times of 1:26, while Byron Boots '03 won the 800m. 
        Perhaps the most dominating victory of the day, was Bowdoin's one-two-three 
        finish in the 1000m by Allison, Matt Mellen '02, and Dave "Mad Dog" Wall 
        '02. The 1000m race marked an impressive comeback by Mad Dog, who had 
        not run a race in 18 months due to a hip injury, suffered during his freshman 
        year.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance runners came through as usual, with a one-two 
        finish in the 1500m by Allison and Dan Gulotta '03. Pat Vardaro '03 finished 
        second in the 3000m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important and anticipated meets of the 
        season is this Saturday's State Meet, at Bates College. At last year's 
        State Meet, the Bowdoin men came through with wave after wave of season 
        best performances on the track from the 55m through the 5K to pull off 
        a terrific upset over the odds-on favorite Bates College. "Last year we 
        went into the State Meet as the underdog, but we believed in ourselves 
        and came out victorious. This year, we are favored slightly, but we'll 
        approach the meet with the same focus, and hopefully, we can create the 
        same result," said Allison.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This will be another close State Meet; we beat Colby, 
        as did Bates...I hope our depth will be the deciding factor," said Coach 
        Peter Slovenski. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jumping events look to be decisive for the Polar 
        Bear effort. "The jumps have narrow margins of tolerance for takeoffs 
        and narrow margins of victory on distances. Our jumpers have a lot of 
        poise and I think they enjoy clutch situations. They've been the key to 
        our success through the regular season, and we'll get a chance to see 
        how they perform in a championship setting," said Coach Slovenski. </p>
