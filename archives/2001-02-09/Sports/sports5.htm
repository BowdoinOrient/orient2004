      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday, Bowdoin hosted its final swim meet of 
        the season, against Trinity College and Wesleyan University. A long-standing 
        tradition of Bowdoin swimming designates the final home meet as a time 
        to recognize the seniors on the team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This coming weekend, the swimmers have a free weekend 
        between the final home meet and the women's NESCAC championships. Therefore, 
        I think it is high time that I write a little sumpin' sumpin' to recognize 
        the team's six fine seniors: captain Erin Veenker, captain Catherine Williams, 
        Jenny Mendelson, Meghan Gregory, Henry Bangert, Dan Farbach and diver 
        Maureen Singer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erin Veenker is a distance swimmer from Chicago, Illinois. 
        A member of her high school team, Erin has extensive experience in the 
        sport and a distance swimmer mentality of "the more yardage, the better." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During her Bowdoin career, Erin has been a member of 
        the New England team and also captain of the water polo team. She continues 
        to contribute her strong leadership skills as co-captain of the team. 
        Erin plans on continuing her education in a nurse practitioner program.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also from the Midwest (Columbus, Ohio) is backstroker 
        Catherine Williams. Unlike most of the swimmers, Catherine was primarily 
        a lacrosse player upon matriculation. She swam for her high school team 
        from sophomore year on, but she planned on playing lacrosse at Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meeting Charlie (Butt, head coach of the team for 39 
        years and until the 1999-2000 school year) was the convincing factor in 
        deciding to swim; I also thought it was funny to have a coach with the 
        last name Butt." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine has been an All-New England swimmer and NCAA 
        Division III National 'B' qualifier. As the other women's team captain, 
        Catherine enjoys coordinating the team's "fun" activities, such as mandatory 
        karaoke.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meghan Gregory also contributes a long history of swimming 
        to the Bowdoin program. The Seekonk, Massachusetts native recently added 
        some butterfly events to her meet agenda, after primarily swimming middle 
        distance freestyle. Meghan is all about taking one for the team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her favorite team memory: "Last year [on the team's 
        training trip] in Hawaii, the team took a day trip to a rainforest on 
        Oahu. We all swam under this huge waterfall. It was a really neat thing 
        to experience with my teammates." In a few years, we'll no longer be able 
        to call her Ms. Gregory; it'll be Dr. Gregory, thank you very much. Meghan 
        plans on going to [Evil] medical school after graduation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jenny Mendelson represents the team's small population 
        from out West. She has been "swimming as long as I can remember," year-round 
        on her Phoenix swim team. As one of the core members of Team Sprint, Jenny 
        has contributed significantly on all-New England relay teams, the individual 
        sprint events, and the butterfly events. Jenny has also played on the 
        water polo team.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her extensive experience swimming year round gives her 
        an added ability to ward off the pressure that every athlete feels, especially 
        at the conference meets. She is known for being an extremely fast anchor 
        leg on relays that Bowdoin needs to win. This girl will also be donning 
        a white lab coat in a few years; Jenny plans on going to medical school 
        as well.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last-but certainly not least-is diver Maureen Singer. 
        From Princeton, New Jersey, Maureen also has been in her sport for much 
        of her young life. She not only helps the team out as an All-New England 
        diver, but as an All-American for the three seasons she has competed with 
        Bowdoin. This season Maureen goes to the NESCAC meet ranked first in the 
        1-meter (undefeated for the season), but claims the 3-meter to be "my 
        best event". <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seniors lead the rest of the women's team into the 
        final days of the season. Next week, the seniors of the men's team will 
        be featured; also included will be the women's team standings as they 
        head into the conference meet. Good luck to all, and happy trails. </p>
