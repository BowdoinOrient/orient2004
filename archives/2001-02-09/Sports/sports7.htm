      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Women's Hockey team ran its record to 11-3-3 
        over the weekend as they knocked off Union and stumbled at Colgate. The 
        weekend's games left the Bears at 7-3-3 in the ECAC east, sitting in third 
        place behind Middlebury and Williams. The games against Union and Colgate 
        came on the heels of a 6-0 thrashing of Colby at home last Wednesday. 
        It was then, an altogether productive week for the team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, at Union, the Bears took a 2-1 victory 
        from the slumping Union squad who lost for the seventh straight time. 
        The game winner came with 2:50 left in the second, as freshman Britney 
        Carr sent one home off an assist from her classmate Kirsten Larson. Bowdoin 
        had to come from a goal behind in this one as Union struck quickly, going 
        up 1-nil just 30 seconds in. It wasn't until early in the second that 
        the Bears picked up the equalizer on a score by Alex Harris '04. The game 
        wasn't as close as the score might seem to indicate though. As the Bowdoin 
        goalie, Klucevek-Whalen '03, faced only 16 shots on the night while the 
        Bears ripped off 44 towards the Union net. The victory pushed the Bears 
        undefeated streak to eight games as they improved to 5-0-3 over that span, 
        including a tie with current #1 Middlebury. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately that streak came to an end on Sunday afternoon 
        on the ice at Colgate, where the Bears fell by a final of 4-2. It was 
        the reverse of the previous day's action as Colgate came from behind in 
        the third period to erase a one-goal lead. Colgate put the puck in the 
        net four times in the first 14 minutes of the period to claim the victory. 
        Bowdoin had taken the lead in the second when Jess Burke '04 netted a 
        power play score to go up 1-0. The Red-Raider attack was just too much 
        for the Bears in the third though. Bowdoin did knock one more in with 
        about five minutes to go to make the final score 4-2. Ba Lanoue '03 picked 
        up that goal to make the score more respectable. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall it was a good week for the Bears though. In 
        addition to holding down the third slot in the ECAC (after being picked 
        as fifth in the preseason), Bowdoin retained the #6 ranking in D-III national 
        polls. Bowdoin has been holding steady in the polls for some time now. 
        If they want to maintain their current position and hopefully advance 
        they'll need to fare well on their current road trip. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a long trip for the Bears; at least they can come 
        back home in between games unlike the pros. But seriously, after playing 
        both matches away from Dayton last weekend the Bears have three more games 
        on unfriendly ice as they travel to Wesleyan, Conn. College and Colby. 
        They will then return home to take on conference foes Trinity and Amherst. 
        Come out and support the Bears' run to the playoffs. </p>
