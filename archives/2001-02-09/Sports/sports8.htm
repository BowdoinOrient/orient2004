      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Men's Basketball team is coming off an up and down 
        weekend that saw them defeat a tough Bates squad on the road Friday night 
        before falling at Tufts the following afternoon. The weekend split brings 
        the Polar Bear's overall season record to 13-6 (3-3 NESCAC).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friday night at Bates (12-7, 0-4 NESCAC), the Polar 
        Bears were able to use a 15-4 run midway through the second half to break 
        open a tightly contested game and eventually triumph by the account of 
        86-76. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory avenged a 73-64 loss suffered at the hands 
        of the Bobcats earlier this year.Bowdoin opened the game with some exceptional 
        shooting and managed to jump out to an early 25-13 lead. Bates, however, 
        quickly struck back, scoring the game's next 15 points and taking a 28-25 
        lead with just under 8 minutes remaining in the first stanza. The remainder 
        of the first half featured a series of ties and lead changes, with the 
        scoreboard reading 35-35 at the conclusion of the first frame.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polar Bears opened the second half in largely the 
        same manner as the first, as senior center David Baranowski staked Bowdoin 
        to a 49-42 lead at the 15:07 mark by scoring five points in a 7-0 run. 
        Bates again answered with a run of their own, pulling ahead 55-54 with 
        12:01 left on the clock. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, however, senior center Eric Buschmann's 
        five straight points ignited the decisive Polar Bear run. Buschmann's 
        spark off the bench, coupled with the strongarm tactics of Baranowski 
        inside and the apt wingplay of junior Greg Orlicz catapulted the Polar 
        bears to a 62-55 lead that they would fail to relinquish the remainder 
        of the way. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, Orlicz led Bowdoin with 21 points (including 
        four of five from 3-point range), while Baranowski flirted with a triple-double-finishing 
        with 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 7 assists. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, sophomore Braden Clement added 14 points, 
        while Chris Ranslow '02 contributed 14 points and 8 rebounds (6 offensive) 
        of his own. Junior point man Mark Gilbride ran the team effectively for 
        33 minutes, finishing with 4 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 assists.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polar Bears were not quite as fortunate Saturday 
        at Tufts, squandering a ten-point second half lead before eventually suffering 
        an agonizing 87-85 loss. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Bowdoin squad fought admirably, cold shooting 
        down the stretch prevented them from capturing what would have been an 
        outstanding road victory against a Jumbos team that is 15-5 and ranked 
        sixth in this week's NCAA Northeast Region poll. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranowski, who led the way for the Polar Bears with 
        20 points and nine rebounds, offered the following thoughts on the devastating 
        Tufts loss: "It's just very disappointing. I mean, when you go out and 
        play as well as we did against a very tough opponent for 30 minutes, only 
        to see a large lead dissipate down the stretch, it's really a tough pill 
        to swallow. Hopefully, we'll be able to bounce back against a strong Colby 
        squad (3:00 p.m., Saturday, at Colby) this weekend." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In defeat, the Polar Bears also received strong performances 
        from Gilbride (13 points), Orlicz (14 points), Clement (15 points, 11 
        in the second half), and Ranslow (13). </p>
