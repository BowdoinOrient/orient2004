      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's hockey team made some great efforts last 
        weekend, but took defeats from top-ranked Middlebury and Norwich at home. 
        The team has five games remaining in its season and is still in the fight 
        for a playoff spot. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middlebury (17-2-1) visited Dayton last Friday, bringing 
        some talented players to battle the Polar Bears (10-7-1). "That could 
        have been one of the more well-played, enjoyable games we've played to 
        date," head coach Terry Meagher said. "It was a classic hockey game, and 
        I thought we played well with a lot of heart." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midd's Matt Skoglund struck first for the Panthers, 
        flicking a shot past senior goaltender Colin Robinson after 12:32 in the 
        first period. During the second period, Bowdoin's Chris Pelletier '04 
        put Bowdoin on the board with a power play goal. It would be the Bears' 
        only tally of the matchup.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thnk we proved that we can compete with one of the 
        top teams in the country," Pelletier said. "We fell a little short, but 
        we played with them for three periods."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Chang netted the game-winner for the Panthers with 
        about 15 minutes to play. Robinson made 23 saves in the loss, while Midd's 
        Christian Carlsson had 17. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With little time to regroup, the Bears faced down another 
        difficult opponent on Saturday. This time the foe was non-NESCAC powerhouse 
        Norwich (12-8-1), a team cited by Coach Meagher as having "…some of the 
        most gifted and talented players in the nation. We played hard, but we 
        made some errors. They really make you pay for your mistakes," he said. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Norwich got on the board first, netting two goals in 
        the first five minutes of the game. First-years Pelletier and Marty Brisebois 
        stepped up for the Bears, tying the score at 2-2. Brian Shuman '02 answered 
        a third Cadet goal with one of his own, assisted by fellow junior Andy 
        McNerney. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tied score continued into the second period, with 
        Bowdoin's Mike Carosi '02 netting a goal at six minutes and after another 
        Norwich tally. The 4-4 tie was broken by Norwich senior Tim Krykostas, 
        who put two past Robinson in the second period. Albert Mayer '03 and Bill 
        Busch '02 found senior Mike O'Leary for the team's fifth goal, but the 
        Cadets would keep the Bears in check for the final five minutes of the 
        game.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, Coach Meagher was pleased with his team's efforts. 
        "We played right to the end, didn't quit, and the bottom line was that 
        we lost it," he said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Norwich is a pretty good team, and we were pretty happy 
        that we hung with them offensively," Pelletier added. "Coach is pretty 
        confident about this weekend; he's happy with our performance against 
        top teams last week."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the games' final outcomes, the team gained some 
        valuable experience. "Against the top opponents, we got better, we learned…It 
        looks like if we get one more point we'll be in the playoffs," Meagher 
        said.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hopeful Bear team has benefited from some big individual 
        contributions, as well as overall teamwork. Colin Robinson, may not be 
        the only Bear earning a spot in the books, as yet another record is in 
        jeopardy this week. Chris Pelletier is currently second in NESCAC's goal 
        scoring category, with 13 scored in conference play. If he nets two more, 
        he will break freshman record currently held by Ron Marcellus (1978-79). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's pretty impressive," said Coach Meagher. "We've 
        had a couple records go down this season, and it's certainly a major milestone."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher continued, saying that the team is grateful 
        for the rousing support of Bowdoin fans as well. "We really appreciate 
        all the support of the fans here," he said. "It was great this weekend 
        to see the students out at the games."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men travel for their next three games, heading to 
        Amherst tonight, Trinity tomorrow, and Colby on Tuesday. They wrap up 
        their season next weekend, playing Babson and Umass-Boston at home. </p>
