      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It definitely was not the most ideal situation for 
        the track team to travel four hours on a bus to the Coast Guard Academy 
        last Saturday morning, leaving the women with only forty minutes to warm 
        up, stretch and prepare for their events. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 180m track, as opposed to the standard 200m track, 
        also presented another factor for the athletes to consider with an extra 
        corner to run in each race and random placement of relay team members 
        on various turns of the track for handoffs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the women performed well again, overcoming the Coast 
        Guard Academy by 70 points and Connecticut College by 90 points. The success 
        of the meet was largely because of the depth of talent of the team. Head 
        Coach Peter Slovenski remarks "We've had good balance and depth in our 
        lineup through the regular season. Our high jumpers, pole vaulters, and 
        600 runners led the way with good sweeps this past weekend."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women's high jump was the highest scoring event 
        of the day with Julia Febiger '03, Ellie Doig '03, Liz Wendell '03 and 
        Caitlin Fowkes '03 (tie for third) and Lily Keller '03 placing first through 
        fifth. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pole vault was another high scoring event with Marika 
        Decyk '02, Anne Barmettler '03, Liz Wendell '03, and Kate Waller '02 claiming 
        first to fourth places.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field events were a huge contribution to the success 
        of the meet. In the jumping events, Liz Wendell and Andrea Weeks '03 placed 
        first and third in the long jump while Casey Kelley '02, Acadia Senese 
        '03 and Karen Yeoman '02 took first, third and fourth in the triple jump. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the throws Shanique Brown '04 and Caitlin Fowkes 
        placed third and fourth in the shot put and sixth and fourth in the 20 
        lb. weight throw.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impressive performances were seen throughout the day 
        in the sprints with Sara Bodnar's '03 second place finish in 55m dash 
        and the 200m. Kristin Dummer '04 turned out a strong performance with 
        a third place finish in the 200m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hurdlers also provided tough competition with Julia 
        Febiger, Ellie Doig, Casey Kelley and Liz Wendell placing second, third, 
        fourth and sixth.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin's women dominated the middle distance events, 
        evident by Febiger's first place finish in the 400m and Shaina Zamitis 
        '02, Lynne Davies '04 and Kate Brinkerhoff's first, second, third place 
        finish in the 600m. Libby Barney '03 also turned out a solid performance 
        with a second place finish in the 800m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4x400m relay team won the event. Highlights of the 
        distance events include Bre-Anne MacKenna '03 and Chelsea Spector's '04 
        second and fourth place finishes in the 1000m. Kala Hardacker '04 placed 
        second in the 1500m run. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4x800m relay team also turned out an impressive 
        performance by Jesse Gray '01, Davies, Jane Culina '04 and Barney lapping 
        the Coast Guard's runner.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now the women's team is 11-1, with the loss to 
        UMASS, Lowell; a division two school. The team's goals are to win the 
        state meet and place well at New England Division II's.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team has been working hard all season and defeating 
        Colby at the state meet has been a focus throughout the season. The women 
        will have their chance to win the state title today at Bates at 5pm. </p>
