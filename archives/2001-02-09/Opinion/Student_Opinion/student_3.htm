      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Valentine's Day. V-day if you will. Sounds eerily like D-Day. 
        I think that's what a lot of people think of Valentine's Day-a surprise 
        attack that lands on your shores once a year just to let you know exactly 
        where you stand in regard to loved ones. For many, it becomes a celebration 
        of the have not, a day to recognize and belabor the fact that you're missing 
        that special someone in your life. I have someone, I have someone not, 
        I have someone, I have someone not….<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But after many Valentine's Days, I've realized that there 
        is a lot more to the 14th of February than just that special someone. 
        There's so much more than candy, flowers, Russel Stover hearts, and fancy 
        romantic dinners. In fact, if you look at the history of Valentine's Day, 
        and D-day (which it's nickname closely resembles) you'll realize that 
        that the 14th isn't solely about telling that loved one how much you care. 
        Valentine's Day is about heroes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The exact history of Valentine's Day is cloudy at best. But 
        what we do know, no matter which version of the tale you chose to believe, 
        is that St. Valentine is a hero. One story centers around a priest, Valentinus, 
        in the third century living in Rome under the emperor of the time, Emperor 
        Claudius II. During this period, the emperor had barred young men from 
        marrying because he believed that single men made better soldiers than 
        those with wives and families. Valentinus defied the emperor and married 
        young lovers in secret. He was caught and murdered for his actions. Another 
        tale suggests that Valentine helped Christians escape the brutal Roman 
        prisons, for which he was later jailed. In jail, he fell in love with 
        his keeper's daughter, and before his execution, sent her a note signed 
        'From your Valentine.' But no matter which tale you choose to believe, 
        Saint Valentine was a hero.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Since the 14th of February isn't solely about romance, it's 
        time we start to recognize the reason that Valentine is forever in our 
        hearts-because he is a hero. And since this upcoming Wednesday will recognize 
        that hero, it's time that we all took a little heroic initiative. This 
        Valentine's Day, don't stress over the fact that you are single, devoid 
        of that romantic date and a romantic dinner. Instead, recognize all the 
        loved ones that you have in your life, and the people that love you. Become 
        that small time hero we all were when we were in grade school sending 
        little Valentines to all your classmates. Putting a smile on someone's 
        face and letting someone know just how much you care is perhaps one of 
        the most wonderful things you can do. And in defiance of loneliness and 
        defiance of all that Valentine's Day has been marketed to be, let those 
        friends or relatives know just how much they mean to you. Because Valentine 
        wasn't out to shoot Cupid's arrows, he was merely out to erase the loneliness 
        that is all too easy to come by in this world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; And so, if you are feeling like your beach has just been 
        invaded, don't stress. Be heroic and liberate yourself from the stigma 
        of Valentine's Day. Celebrate the 14th as a hero, for the hero it recognizes. 
        But even if you can't get past that feeling of an invasion upon your personal 
        relationships, know this: at least the attack on Normandy was on French 
        shores, headed to Paris-the city of love. V-Day has that same direction, 
        and it's carrying you there too. It just takes a bit of fighting along 
        the way.</p>
