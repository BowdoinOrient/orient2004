      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other day I was walking down a hallway in my dorm when 
        I stopped to read what someone had written on their dry-erase board. It 
        was late at night so I can't quote precisely, but it said something along 
        the lines of "NEWS: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are separating," and 
        then went on to bemoan the breakup of Hollywood's supercouple. Later that 
        night, I was speaking to some friends from home and generously shared 
        my newfound knowledge. "Yeah, I heard that a few days ago," one said. 
        "I know!!!" exclaimed another. "I think someone told me that yesterday." 
        "Old news." OLD NEWS???? How had I not heard this earlier? What was wrong 
        with me? Is the Bowdoin bubble that impenetrable?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the answer to the first question is that I, as well 
        as some friends who agreed to participate in an informal survey, shamefully 
        gather most of our news from either those little news tickers that appear 
        when we sign on to AOL Instant Messenger or from our professors. The answer 
        to the second question is nothing-I'm just a Bowdoin student. And the 
        answer to the third question is absolutely, unless some effort is exerted. 
        This is a little disgusting. It does not reflect well on us at all. The 
        overwhelming percentage of students at the sixth-best college in America 
        who do not have any idea of what goes on beyond their campus is not a 
        figure that we would want the U.S. News and World Report adding to our 
        data alongside SAT scores and percentage of alums who donate money. We 
        are here to become educated, interesting, well-rounded citizens of the 
        world and yet none of the friends that I asked could tell me who had just 
        won the recent Israeli election. It does seem, in the students' defense, 
        that we are not merely a group of self-absorbed, lazy brats. Most of us 
        are actually pretty interested in what is going on in the world. But Bowdoin 
        students work extremely hard (and play extremely hard) and the fact of 
        the matter is we just don't have the time to follow the news between classes, 
        work, meals, sports, sleeping, extracurricular activities, and uh, letting 
        off steam on the weekends. I mean, technically, I could be at www.nytimes.com 
        right now, but instead I am writing for the Orient. I know that we have 
        the lockbox of papers by the mailboxes and my parents actually signed 
        me up for that service at the beginning of the year. But because anyone 
        can learn the lock combination and the newspapers are just placed there 
        by quantity of orders each day, it is anybody's guess as to whether or 
        not there will even be a whole newspaper in there on the days that I have 
        time to check.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the Administration or the Executive Board or 
        whoever it is, has come up with a fabulous solution to all of our lack-of-knowledge-of-current-affairs 
        problems. It has been proposed that newspapers such as The New York Times, 
        The Wall Street Journal, and The Boston Globe continue to be distributed 
        throughout campus for students to read and/or buy. I, as well as other 
        students whom I have asked, think this is the best idea Bowdoin has had 
        since putting mints outside of the dining halls. This way, students can 
        learn about the world as well as eat, research methods of torture in Ancient 
        Greece and Rome, go to lacrosse practice, work at Bears and Cubs, write 
        that Orient article and whatever else it is they do. As a matter of fact, 
        this week as I was getting lunch at the Pub (since my hectic schedule 
        is not always in compliance with meal plan meal hours) I was able to read 
        The New York Times that was lying on a table in Smith Union. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I wholeheartedly encourage Bowdoin College to continue to 
        go through with this newspaper distribution. It will only benefit the 
        student body and add to the breadth of the liberal arts education that 
        strives to help us become active participants in the world (in addition 
        to letting some of us know right away that Tom Cruise is finally single 
        once again-or fuel the rumors that it was a sham marriage).</p>
