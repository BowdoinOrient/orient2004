      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't go to Napster to download the new Dave Matthews 
        Band song because I was excited to hear it. I downloaded the song because 
        I was afraid. You see, after recording a majority of songs for the new 
        album with veteran producer Steve Lillywhite, Dave and the band went on 
        vacation and, on their return, promptly fired Lillywhite. I'm not sure 
        what brought on this crisis of modern music (Lillywhite practically invented 
        the "big drum" sound that has characterized much of the Dave Matthews 
        Band's sound during his work with XTC and Peter Gabriel during the late 
        1970s and early 1980s), but that wasn't what made me the most afraid. 
        What made me the most afraid was that, in Lillywhite's place, Matthews 
        hired Glen Ballard. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When I found out that the Band had replaced Lillywhite with 
        Ballard-co-writer of Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill album, Michael 
        Jackson's anthem "Man in the Mirror," and The Pointer Sisters' synthesizer-laden 
        mid-1980s classic "Jump (For My Love)"-I was shocked. I was further shocked 
        to learn that Dave Matthews had hired Ballard not only as a producer, 
        but also as a co-writer. Was this the end of the Dave Matthews Band we 
        knew and love, complete with complex, beautiful songs like "The Best of 
        What's Around" and "Stay (Wasting Time)" broken down to three-minute segments 
        of repetitive choruses, a lá "Ironic"?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite my fears, I downloaded "I Did It," a song available 
        exclusively through Napster, when I returned to Bowdoin. On first listen, 
        I was nearly speechless. The song is short, is full of electric guitars, 
        and is incredibly poppy. After a few more listens, though, I was hooked. 
        Ballard, it seems, has consolidated Dave Matthews's jams into something 
        much more concise. Thanks be to Napster for allaying my fears.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Like most college students, I use Napster for more than the 
        occasional Dave Matthews download, however. (Now, before all you copyright 
        hounds start sending angry letters to the Orient editors, please note 
        that, at this moment, I have 617 CDs. That's a lot of money going to record 
        companies, managers, distributors, and (yes) artists, so back off. I also 
        write and release my own music on MP3.com, and I would gladly reinvest 
        my $2.00 a month in royalties to poor Lars Ulrich.) In any case, I tend 
        to use Napster to download those "guilty pleasures" that I can't quite 
        bring myself to buy; in fact, the first song I ever downloaded was Bobby 
        Brown's theme from the second Ghostbusters movie. And now that I apparently 
        have all this free time, what with my student teaching allowing me to 
        slack off, I've been hitting Napster more than ever. Here, for public 
        consumption, are some of my most interesting downloads:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Eddie Money's "Take Me Home Tonight": I heard this song on 
        the radio the other day, and realized how much I absolutely hate to love 
        it. The only problem was that - of course - I couldn't remember who it 
        was by. One night, a few weeks ago, Mia, Curtis, and I were watching "The 
        Making of 'Thriller'" on VH-1, and I asked them if they could think of 
        a song "sung by a guy, but with a woman on the chorus." I proceeded to 
        sing "be my little babyyyyyyy" while making "So?" gestures with my hands, 
        to which Curtis replied, "Um...You mean, 'Take Me Home Tonight'?" He gets 
        the gold star for power-ballads, that roommate of mine.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Martin Murphy's "Wildfire": This epic AM radio staple 
        is a favorite of my roommate, Chris, who also listens to Mel Tormé and 
        Frank Sinatra, which is perfectly fine, but a little weird. In any case, 
        Chris and I especially like the verse where Murphy sings, so emotionally: 
        "Oh they say she died one winter / When there came a killing frost / And 
        the pony she named Wildfire / Busted down his stall." Run, Wildfire, run!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Michael McDonald's "I Keep Forgetting" and Warren G.'s "Regulators": 
        Mount up! "Regulators," the great mid-1990s rap tune from Warren G., is 
        comprised entirely of a sample of former Doobie Brother Michael McDonald's 
        early-1980s AM radio hit. (What is it with me and old AM radio hits?) 
        Both songs are so fascinatingly odd that I had to have them - and it's 
        especially funny to listen to them in quick succession. Here's a fun exercise: 
        try to sing the Warren G. rap along to the original song. You'll feel 
        the power, baby.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Chaka Kahn's "I Feel for You," Michael Jackson's "Wanna Be 
        Startin' Something," and Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing": There's something 
        so soulful about 1980s R&B hits, isn't there? I think that's all I have 
        to say. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So, as you can see, my use of Napster is limited to songs 
        that would have otherwise disappeared from my life long ago. I like to 
        think of this type of file-sharing technology as my own little time machine, 
        allowing me to go back to the days of my youth when I drank Kool-Aid on 
        a regular basis, had sleep-overs, and thought that Phil Collins was a 
        good musician. Ah, the glory of Napster.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; (A necessary post-script: over winter break, pop music lost 
        two of its greatest stars. Kirsty MacColl, an angelic British singer-songwriter 
        who sang with The Smiths, Van Morrison, The Rolling Stones, The Pogues, 
        Billy Bragg, and so many others; and Robert Buck, guitarist for 10,000 
        Maniacs and co-writer of such songs as "These Are the Days," both died 
        within a few days of each other. To find out more about Kirsty, visit 
        http://www.freeworld.demon.co.uk, and to visit Rob's Chautauqua Region 
        Community Fund, a scholarship fund formed by the band in Rob's memory,
