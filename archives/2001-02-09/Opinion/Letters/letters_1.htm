      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitty Sullivan's report last week on the Health Center outlined 
        the more important changes that have occurred since the summer in our 
        staffing and service model. Her discussion will hopefully clarify some 
        of the confusion that has surrounded these changes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; There are two points, however, that require further clarification. 
        First, our nurses have never functioned "as P.A.s [Physician's Assistants] 
        without actually having had a license," nor were they ever expected to 
        do so. They have always practiced according to written protocols and standing 
        orders, developed by a supervising physician, which ensured that the nurses' 
        actions were at all times both clinically sound and perfectly legal. These 
        protocols and orders specified and limited the types of evaluations and 
        procedures they could perform. Our Physician Assistants' scope of practice 
        is much broader, and includes, for instance, the ability to prescribe 
        medications.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the reference in the article to the "uncanny timing 
        of her departure" was not intended to refer to Robin Beltramini, who had 
        left Bowdoin well before my arrival at the Health Center. The point I 
        was making is that the timing of the announcement this past December of 
        our reorganization and the implementation of our new service model, and 
        the resulting departure of one, and possibly both, of the nurses, was 
        in part related to college budgeting cycles. I was also making the point 
        that the changes were well thought out, carefully planned, and discussed 
        at multiple administrative levels.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this helps clarify things. I also hope that students, 
        faculty, and staff will take particular notice of my closing comments 
        in the article. We are working hard to make our Center even better, and 
        have already accomplished a great deal. We are also working hard to earn 
        the interest and trust of students. We are here to serve you, and to serve 
        you with the highest quality care and preventive services possible.</p>
