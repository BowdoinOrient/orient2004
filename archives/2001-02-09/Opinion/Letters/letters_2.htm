      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Just when I thought I had recovered from the pain of being 
        abruptly terminated from my position at Bowdoin College, I picked up last 
        week's Orient to read that I had supervised a health care facility for 
        9 years that allowed registered nurses to work illegally, putting students 
        at risk!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In a letter to the Bowdoin community, Jeff Benson stated 
        that, " The previous nurses could function as P. A.s (physician assistants) 
        without actually having had a license, but this was legally and liability-wise 
        risky for patients." This is a grossly inaccurate statement and is unfair 
        to me, Joan Mitchell, Mary Ann Boulos-Lord and all the other nurses who 
        have worked at the Dudley Coe in the last nine years. At no time during 
        my tenure as director of student health services at Bowdoin was any nurse 
        allowed to work outside of her scope of practice or in violation of her 
        nursing license. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; When I assumed the position as nurse practitioner director 
        in 1991, we had just been reorganized by the then new Edwards Administration. 
        We were downsized from a staffing level very similar to the current configuration 
        in place at the Dudley Coe. One of my first responsibilities was to develop 
        written protocols for the registered nurses, which covered many aspects 
        of student care. These protocols were reviewed and signed annually by 
        the supervising physician. Before we initiated these protocols, the Maine 
        State Board of Nursing, Bowdoin College's legal counsel, and our malpractice 
        insurance carrier all agreed that the responsibilities given to the nurses 
        were appropriate given their training and the plan of supervision already 
        in place. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Additional statements in Benson's letter and in the Orient 
        article suggest that students were regularly inconvenienced by having 
        to see multiple providers to get their needs met and that this generated 
        many complaints. In the 14 years that I provided care to students as a 
        nurse practitioner at Bowdoin, most students were comforted by the fact 
        that we worked as a team to provide for them, creating a safety net that 
        extended outside of the Health Center into the Brunswick medical community. 
        The number one complaint expressed every year was that the Dudley Coe 
        was not open at night and on weekends, as it had been in the past.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As Ms. Sullivan suggested in last week's article, the timing 
        of both my termination last spring and the terminations of Mrs. Mitchell 
        and Ms. Boulos-Lord in December all happened as students were either occupied 
        with finals or had left for summer break. Students would do well to examine 
        the suggestion by Benson that the timing of my departure had " more to 
        do with the college budgeting policies than anything else." Anyone who 
        knows anything about the budgeting process at Bowdoin would find this 
        statement absurd.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Joan Mitchell, Mary Ann Boulos-Lord, and I never considered 
        our work at the Health Center just a daily job to be completed. This professional, 
        sincere commitment to the health and well being of all students allowed 
        us to nourish caring relationships based on trust and mutual respect. 
        Students understood that we were there to care for and guide them through 
        whatever problems arose during their years at Bowdoin. It is the loss 
        of this unique healing partnership that has led to the community dismay 
        that Benson dismisses as an "…. unfortunate… emotional climate."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I will never really know why Tim Foster felt he had to tell 
        me last May that "we had to go our separate ways" nor will I ever stop 
        worrying that my friendship with Joan and Mary Ann cost them their jobs. 
        But I am certain that our loss from the Bowdoin community has nothing 
        to do with legal, liability, budget, or quality of care issues.</p>
