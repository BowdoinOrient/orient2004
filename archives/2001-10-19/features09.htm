        <font size="2">ADAM BARBER</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">Admiral Michael Ratliffe, USN (Ret.) made many remarkable 
        comments, during his recent lecture in Daggett Lounge, but perhaps one 
        was slightly more remarkable than the others. &quot;We will almost never 
        have advance notice,&quot; Ratliffe announced, speaking of future terrorist 
        attacks. His frightening intuition gains additional significance in light 
        of his many years spent in the intelligence community, culminating in 
        his service as the 58th Director of Naval Intelligence. Drawing on his 
        decades of experience, Ratliffe gave a lecture entitled &quot;What is 
        Victory in Our War Against Terror?&quot; on Thursday, October 11th.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There was both fear and hope in the admiral's message. Of 
        paramount importance was his recognition that the events of September 
        11th fundamentally altered the way Americans will think and act in the 
        future. Many aspects of our lives will now be seen through the lens of 
        the 11th, and Ratliffe spoke of a &quot;dissonance&quot; between the time 
        before and after the events in New York and Washington. His preliminary 
        observations focused on what he saw happening in wake of the tragedy, 
        with an emphasis on the new unpredictability in the world. His hope, and 
        it was a sincere hope, was that America would meet this new uncertainty 
        through, in his words, its &quot;awesome unity.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">The bulk of Ratliffe's lecture focused on the war on terror 
        from a theoretical standpoint. There was little discussion of front-line 
        tactics and the military. Rather, Ratliffe sought to justify the current 
        U.S. action in Afghanistan using a pragmatic, &quot;just war&quot; approach 
        to the situation. He stated that our action was directed by a competent 
        authority (elected leaders), whereas the action against us on September 
        11th was directed by a fanatic empowered only by his own distorted vision 
        of the world. While our action will inevitably yield noncombatant casualties, 
        they are never our intention; the action against us served the sole purpose 
        of slaughtering the innocent. Finally, our action is justified by the 
        most basic of human motives-self-defense; the action against us was motivated 
        by hate, the most inhuman intent of all.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Victory in this war, Ratliffe argued (using carefully chosen 
        euphemisms), will come when we have &quot;dislocated&quot; international 
        terrorists and delivered a &quot;stern message&quot; to those who aid 
        them. Ratliffe avoided a word often used to describe our goals in this 
        campaign: elimination. Terrorism is not an idea, and ideas cannot be eliminated. 
        Terrorism isn't the inherent problem; it is the expression of terrorism-violence-that 
        plagues us. We need to deter violence, and we can do this by &quot;dislocating&quot; 
        the present terror threat. Ratliffe's concept of victory is yet another 
        example of his pragmatic approach. As a corollary to his argument on victory, 
        he emphasized that success depends on will; that is, America in its &quot;awesome 
        unity.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">To conclude his talk, Ratliffe proposed several characteristics 
        of the future world. He sees the twenty-first century as one with great 
        conflict, and even went so far as to say that without restraint and control 
        &quot;our future as a species will be called into question.&quot; In addition, 
        this conflict will be &quot;nastier&quot; and &quot;up close and personal.&quot; 
        Finally, Ratliffe's experience as an intelligence officer in the Navy 
        was reflected in his expectation that information superiority will become 
        key in waging war. He took this opportunity to describe America as &quot;incapable 
        of spy work,&quot; highlighting the need for greater investment of money 
        and human resources in the intelligence community.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the end, Admiral Ratliffe's message was clear: victory 
        in our war on terror depends much more on what we do here at home than 
        what goes on in Central Asia. The question he posed, &quot;what is victory 
        in our war against terror?&quot; assumes that there can be victory in 
        our war against terror. Considering his remark that we will almost never 
        have advance notice of an impending terrorist attack, one questions the 
        sheer possibility of true victory. Yet given the awesome unity of America 
        in the past month, one can also argue that victory is already ours.</p>
