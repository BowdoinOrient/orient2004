      <p align="left">Franklin Pierce wrote of his journey through the countryside 
        to join the command of Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott's American army, &quot;[We] 
        were enveloped in driving clouds as we wound round the mountain until 
        we reached a short turn, where there is a table land of small extent, 
        at which point, the sun breaking through the mist and the clouds rolling 
        partially away toward the Southeast, such a scene was revealed to our 
        vision, hitherto hemmed in by a narrow precipitous road and dense fog, 
        as I do not even hope ever again to witness&#133;On the left, rising above 
        the dark precipitous mountains by the base of which we passed, was visible 
        so much of Orisaba as is covered with eternal snow. On the right and a 
        few miles distant the finest cascade probably in this land of mountains. 
        It looked, in the sunlight, with a rough somber background, like a silver 
        thread dropped down a perpendicular descent of more than two hundred feet. 
        Beyond, lay the Ocean in plain full view, upon it, we all cast a longing 
        lingering glance.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was probably the most beautiful countryside a soldier 
        could witness as he campaigned in a distant land. This was Mexico and 
        the year was 1847. Pierce, Bowdoin class of 1824, was leading a brigade 
        of reinforcements to join the rest of the hard-fought American army awaiting 
        them at Puebla, a mere seventy-five miles from their objective, which 
        was the capital of Mexico City.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce was no soldier. He was a politician but this little 
        war fought, as most New Englanders contended, for the illegal annexation 
        of another nation's land and to feed the already threatening institution 
        of slavery, was an opportunity for Mr. Pierce to put another feather in 
        his career cap. And thus, with his political connections, he had acquired 
        the rank of brigadier general. Afraid that he would be too late to join 
        the army before the War was won, he relaxed as he marched into Puebla 
        on August 6 to find Scott's army still there.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce's reinforcements gave Scott a total fighting force 
        of 14,000 men. With this small army, Scott intended to fight a Mexican 
        force three times his size under the dictator Antonio L&oacute;pez de 
        Santa Anna and win the War. Criticism from across the sea said that it 
        was an impossibility. The Duke of Wellington, that grand old British soldier 
        who had defeated Emperor Napoleon on the fields of Waterloo uttered, &quot;Scott 
        is lost- he cannot capture the city and he cannot fall back on his base.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Scott was a soldier, and he did not care for what others 
        thought. Within a few hours of receiving Pierce's men, he moved. Years 
        later while the troops who served under Scott were killing each other 
        on the fields of the American Civil War, many of them would remember his 
        tactics and try to reproduce them. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Scott's next objective was to take Mexico City but that 
        was to be no easy task. Santa Anna was there with thousands of troops 
        and hundreds of guns. The population was hostile and the city itself was 
        ringed with natural obstacles that could only spell doom for an invading 
        army. But this was no ordinary army, for Scott had with him some of the 
        best minds that the Military Academy at West Point had produced. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With these engineers, Scott found away around most of the 
        natural obstacles and placed his army to the southwest of the city. Crossing 
        a lava field known as the Pedregal, Scott's troops isolated a Mexican 
        command under General Gabriel Valencia at a place called Contreras. Here 
        would begin a series of running battles outside the walls of Mexico City.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce's command was part of the action against Contreras. 
        While riding among the men, however, his horse was stunned by an artillery 
        shell. Pierce was thrown forward, injuring his pelvis. In pain, he fainted 
        just as his horse collapsed. When the senior officer in the brigade was 
        called to take command, he asked what had happened. Someone yelled out, 
        &quot;Take command of the brigade, General Pierce is a damned coward!&quot; 
        The reputation stuck. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pierce's knee had been wrenched and his horse had a broken 
        leg. When ordered to remain behind due to his injuries Pierce begged Scott 
        to let him go forward with his troops. This was the battle of Churubusco, 
        another fight in which the Americans were victorious in driving the Mexican 
        army back against Mexico City's defenses. In this fight, however, Pierce 
        fainted again from the pain of his injuries. His reputation was not helped 
        by this, nor was it furthered by an armistice, which Pierce helped to 
        negotiate after the battle.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This armistice was not long lasting. It had been a ploy 
        for Santa Anna to beef up his defenses. Scott finally dissolved the armistice 
        and moved again, this time for the city itself. The battles of Molino 
        del Rey and Chapultepec were fought and Pierce's brigade took part in 
        most of the action.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The problem was Pierce himself was not there to lead his 
        troops. At Molino del Rey, he had been too late to be of any importance 
        and at Chapultepec, he had been down with diarrhea. When he was finally 
        ready to get back into action, it was too late for Mexico City had already 
        fallen.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And thus ended the military career of Franklin Pierce. He 
        had gone to war hoping that it would enhance his reputation, but instead 
        it had worked against him and rumors that he was a coward were spreading 
        like wildfire. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The other Mexican War veterans, in the mean time, were given 
        heroes' welcomes. In Charleston, South Carolina, Generals Quitman (an 
        unfortunate name for any soldier) and Shields were greeted by five thousand 
        militia troops. Witnessing this spectacle of Southern power was a very 
        young Thomas Worchester Hyde. Years later, he would remember the event 
        and claim that President Lincoln's initial call for seventy-five thousand 
        volunteers to suppress a state of rebellion in the South was inadequet 
        to the task. Hyde, still young enough to be considered a boy at that point, 
        was ignored.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After lying low for a while, Franklin Pierce was suddenly 
        nominated by his peers for the office of the President of the United States 
        in the election 1852. Two years later William Pitt Fessenden would be 
        nominated by another political party to help combat the extension of slavery 
        and fight the Democratic administration of Franklin Pierce.<br>
