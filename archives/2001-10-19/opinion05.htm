      <p align="left">Recently I was on my way back to Quinby House after a long 
        night of studying and I noticed a friend talking to a woman who was sitting 
        beneath a tree. I wondered what was going on but as I approached I realized 
        that the woman was a homeless person in need of a place to stay. Apparently, 
        the local shelter was full and she needed a hotel. While we went into 
        the house to call a taxi, she vanished back into the night fog. We can 
        only hope that she found safety and shelter. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As I was reflecting on that unusually graphic dose of reality 
        I couldn't help but think of it as an obvious connection to the current 
        situation in Afghanistan as our government ponders its goals for our new 
        kind of war: do we seek only Osama Bin Laden, or do we not end our aggressive 
        presence in the middle east until both the Taliban and Saddam Hussein 
        are out of power? Two recent pieces illumine a perspective on this issue 
        that is often ignored not only on this campus but in the mainstream media 
        itself. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Firstly, National Review Online editor Jonah Goldberg has 
        an excellent piece on <a href="http://www.townhall.com">townhall.com</a> 
        that suggests that the attack on the World Trade Center was not a result 
        of too great a presence in world affairs, but rather too passive a presence. 
        He suggests that it is time for America to consider a &quot;new colonialism.&quot; 
        When I read this article for the first time, I was shocked at this utterance 
        of what could be called the &quot;c-word&quot; in the politically correct 
        lexicon of verboten W&ouml;rter. </p>
      <p align="left">However, upon a deeper analysis, there is little doubt that 
        Goldberg is correct. One of Goldberg's most cited sources was a recent 
        article in The Weekly Standard by The Wall Street Journal's Opinion Features 
        Editor Max Boot. Mr. Boot's piece not only proves that America needs a 
        new kind of &quot;colonialism&quot; but that this new foreign policy would 
        be beneficial not only for our country but for the denizens of the countries 
        that we inhabit. In his article, Mr. Boot draws on two often discussed 
        examples: the Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s and the Gulf War of 1991. 
        Both analyses reach entirely different conclusions than most of the opinions 
        in both the print and broadcast media. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One common explanation of the September 11th attacks is 
        that we should feel some semblance of responsibility because we supplied 
        the Afghans with arms during its fight against the Soviets. Mr. Boot suggests 
        that our supplying of arms was not the mistake. Rather our mistake was 
        that we did not stay in the region to ensure that a peaceful and democratic 
        government was in place. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The discussion of Iraq is probably more recognizable to 
        most political observers. It suggests that we should not have ended the 
        Gulf War until Saddam Hussein was removed from power. Even though NATO 
        Secretary General George Robertson has supposedly concluded that there 
        is little evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the World Trade Center attacks, 
        I suspect Saddam was shedding few tears as the twin towers crumbled. There 
        is also ample evidence going back to the time of the Gulf War that Hussein 
        constructs biological weapons. This leads some experts to believe that 
        he may be behind the slew of Anthrax attacks that have frightened our 
        country in recent days. These reasons alone should justify vigilance in 
        the Middle East until he is removed from power. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many pundits have expressed concern at the practicality 
        of such intervention in the Middle East. Boot suggests, and I agree, that 
        the sort of rebuilding presence that will be required must be bilateral. 
        Once the Taliban and Hussein are removed from their respective offices, 
        an ad hoc organization similar to the allied occupation of Germany after 
        the Second World War should remain in Central Asia until the region is 
        stabilized. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">President Bush should employ the same speechwriters that 
        put him in the Oval Office as he crafts his defense of &quot;compassionate 
        colonialism.&quot; As he has pointed out, millions of Afghani children 
        are starving under the repressive rule of the Taliban. The same can be 
        said of Iraq where Saddam has used biological weapons against his own 
        citizens. The repressed peoples of these regimes are sitting outside in 
        the rain waiting for us to help them by removing from power those that 
        deny them food, clothing, shelter, and opportunity. Is it not our duty 
        to see that they are safe and taken care of before they disappear into 
        the fog? CoMpAsSiOnATE CoLoNiAlIsm<br>
