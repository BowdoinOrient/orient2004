      <p align="left">From Cape Town to Cairo and from refugee camps to classrooms, 
        National Geographic filmmaker, Mick Davie has seen it all. Davie's visit 
        to Bowdoin, sponsored by the Bowdoin Film Society, drew a standing room 
        only audience in Smith Auditorium this past Sunday.<br>
      </p>

      </table>
      <p align="left">Davie's filmmaking career took root after he accepted a 
        teaching position in his homeland of Zimbabwe. Having purchased a cheap 
        airline ticket, he then received a call that the budget had been cut, 
        and the position was no longer available. With ticket in hand, Davie purchased 
        a camera and set off to hitchhike in Cape Town in search of stories that 
        would take ABC (an Australian T.V. network like America's PBS) for a ride. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie initially sought to film the natural phenomena of 
        Africa, but the many people who had stories to tell sidetracked him. Davie 
        weaved his way up the Coast of Africa filming these people and their stories. 
        He returned to Australia eight months later and impressed the ABC network. 
        After airing his footage in Australia, the film was sold to National Geographic. 
        Soon after, he was hired by the elite organization to produce films.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since then, Davie has produced a variety of successful films 
        for National Geographic, but the success of his work comes with many emotional 
        burdens. Davie continually witnesses the devastating living conditions 
        of refugees, he continually peers into the lives of individuals who are 
        dealing with pain and death, and he has not only witnessed numerous deaths, 
        but also walked in places where the stench of death was tremendously pervasive.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie showed his first movie War Child for the Bowdoin audience. 
        Davie's one-month trip allowed him to capture the human side of the Albanian 
        crisis. &quot;Never in my life have I seen such grace in the face of adversity,&quot; 
        Davie said. His film focused on the Albanian refugee camps and on many 
        of the children who had lost parents and siblings. His footage also included 
        interviews with U.S. troops who were sent to provide security for the 
        refugee camps. His filmmaking captured everyday scenes such as a group 
        of children displaying the peace sign on their hands and chanting Kosovo. 
        Davie continually focuses on the optimism that the refugees endured. He 
        stated, &quot;No where was there a Kosovo refugee who felt sorry for themselves. 
        They were happy just to be alive.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During his presentation, War Child was followed by a fifteen-minute 
        snippet from Davie's film, The Front Line Diaries. Davie gave a brief 
        introduction to the film by telling the story of how he was inspired to 
        complete the other half of the War Child film. The story went as follows: 
        He set off to Macedonia with his brother, where he hopped on the back 
        of a truck with a liberated family returning to their home. Davie witnessed 
        the emotional pain of this family as they realized their home had been 
        bombed and their animals unexplainably slaughtered. The grandfather pulled 
        out two chairs from the rubble and insisted that Davie and his brother 
        take a seat. The family then sat around them, built a fire and gave the 
        brothers the only two cups of coffee that they had. Davie questioned their 
        acts and the grandfather replied, &quot;We are still capable of a simple 
        act of kindness.&quot; The grandfather relayed how he still cared for 
        humanity despite the actions of the Serbs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In contrast to this story, Davie told another of when he 
        was following American marines on patrol. The group walked into a thick 
        stench, which they followed to an apartment that was covered in blood. 
        In the middle of the apartment there was a Serbian man who had been stripped 
        and tied to a chair. He had been badly burned and his throat had been 
        slashed. Davie said, &quot;To this day, I can taste that smell.&quot; 
        A group of refugees had killed this Serb in revenge.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The film clip Apartheid's Child from The Front Line Diaries 
        focused on the first South Africans to grow up free of white oppression. 
        Davie followed a seventeen-year-old girl, Sylvia, who was living alone, 
        while struggling to survive and gain an education. Davie worked long hours 
        for forty days with police, paramedics, prisons, and trauma wards, but 
        primarily followed a classroom of South African students. Davie told the 
        audience in Smith Auditorium about one day when the class told him to 
        turn around and close his eyes. When he turned back around the class sang 
        happy birthday and presented him with a cake that they had baked. &quot;That 
        was by far the best birthday I've ever had,&quot; Davie said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final film that Davie presented was a clip from Honor 
        Among Men, which focuses on the killing of women in Pakistan. Davie followed 
        one woman whose ears, nose and tongue had been cut off by her husband. 
        Davie noted that in all of his films, he seeks to find the perfect character 
        to tell the stories of living conditions in other countries. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie said, &quot;I'm often asked why I expose myself to 
        these experiences. I'm addicted to situations with high emotion, intensity, 
        conflict, war, [and] things like that.&quot; Davie never forgets the people 
        he interviews and those who have helped him to produce such moving films. 
        He sends money to Sylvia, the girl he shadowed in South Africa and keeps 
        in touch with many of the other people he has worked with throughout his 
        career. He helped locate American plastic surgeons and disguise specialists 
        to repair the women's face from Pakistan.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie's filmmaking process is not characterized by speed. 
        National Geographic allows Davie as much time as he needs in order to 
        create these films. Typically Davie spends four to five weeks researching 
        with an associate producer and making hundreds of phone calls. He then 
        spends five to six weeks in the field. After returning, he spends two 
        weeks digitizing the footage and three months editing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie admitted that his job is emotionally challenging. 
        &quot;My job is to try not to burst out crying like I'd like to, but to 
        bring the story back.&quot; He later said, &quot;Yeah it's not easy but 
        it's a hell of a lot easier than what these people have to go through.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Davie is currently planning to make a trip to Afghanistan 
        to cover the events there. His addiction to the crises of the world allows 
        innocent victims of war access to the media. For Davie, that is what it 
        is all about. &quot;I believe it is important to provide a voice for those 
        who do not have a voice at all.&quot;</p>
