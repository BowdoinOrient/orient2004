        </font></p>
      <p align="left">After last year's fatal fire at Seton Hall University, in 
        which 3 students were killed, the Bowdoin Community asked, &quot;Could 
        that have happened here?&quot; The fact is, as last Friday's fire showed, 
        it could happen anywhere.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the National Fire Prevention Association, approximately<br>
        1,400 structure fires occurred in school residence halls, fraternities, 
        and sororities. The most common causes of fires in these residences are 
        incendiary or suspicious causes. The second leading cause is cooking and 
        the third is smoking.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With recent on-campus events, this is a good time to ask 
        ourselves, &quot;What is Bowdoin College doing to help protect life and 
        property and preventing fires?&quot;<br>
        Bowdoin's fire protection equipment is inspected regularly and the following 
        items can be found in College residences:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Smoke detectors are located in all rooms, hallways, and 
        lounges of College residences. If you smoke anywhere in the building, 
        chances are the smoke detector will activate the fire alarm because they 
        are very sensitive. If you hit one by accident while playing football 
        in the hallway, it will activate the fire alarm as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fire dlarms are located in each hallway of all College residences.<br>
        Try to be aware of where these pull stations are, because you never know 
        when you might need them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fire extinguishers are located on all floors of dormitories 
        and are encased in glass containers that should be broken only in case 
        of an emergency. In apartment complexes, fire extinguishers are located 
        in individual apartments. Again, it is necessary to be aware of the location 
        of this equipment. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few years ago, a fire at Brunswick Apartments destroyed 
        an entire apartment. A lit candle sitting in a window tipped over and 
        ignited the couch. <br>
        The student, who was home at the time, initially went to tell the proctor. 
        She ran past the fire extinguisher in her apartment, past a fire pull 
        station in the hallway, past the 'blue light' emergency phone on the quad, 
        and to her proctor's apartment. Passing all of the fire prevention items 
        that were in place wasted several minutes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The best time to think of fire prevention is now, before 
        it actually happens.<br>
        Sprinklers are located in most residence halls. Properly installed and 
        maintained sprinklers prevent deaths outside the areas of origin in all 
        but a few unusual situations. Property damage is 36% lower in living areas 
        where sprinklers are present.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What can you do? When cooking, stick around. Don't leave 
        food unattended. If something in the microwave catches on fire, keep the 
        door closed and unplug it. Do not try to remove burning containers from 
        a microwave.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Do not smoke in residence halls. (prohibited in student 
        handbook)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Do not burn candles in the residence halls. (prohibited 
        in student handbook)<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What if you are caught in a fire? If you have to escape 
        through smoke, crawl on the floor to your exit. The air is cleaner there. 
        Test doorknobs and spaces around the door with the back of your hand for 
        heat. The back of your hand is much more sensitive than the front. Use 
        the stairs, never the elevator. If you are trapped, call the fire department 
        and tell them where you are. Seal your door with wet rags and if possible 
        signal your presence from a window. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Your building has an evacuation plan; learn it and participate 
        in all drills. The residence halls also have a 'meeting point' outside 
        of the building. If you don't know where this is, ask your proctor. Most 
        importantly, if you hear an alarm, leave immediately. Don't wait to see 
        if it is a false alarm. With today's improved technology we have very 
        few 'false alarms'.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Each semester, Security conducts fire drills. We don't do 
        this to irritate or disturb students. We do it because we know how important 
        it is to know what to do in case of a real fire. And we do not want to 
        see any loss of life from a fire at Bowdoin College.<br>
