      <p>The time is now for the Bowdoin Men's Soccer Team to strike as it heads 
        into the season's last three games. In the past four games, the team has 
        returned to its winning form, going 3-1 and outscoring its opponents 14-3. 
        The men are 7-3-1 and now sit at fourth in NESCAC rankings.<br>

      <p>In the most recent action from last week, the Polar Bears picked up two 
        wins at home, defeating Southern Maine 4-1, and Connecticut College 2-0. 
        Thursday's effort against Southern Maine got off to a quick start as Bobby 
        Desilets '05 converted a David Bulow '02 pass for the first goal. USM 
        countered with a goal of their own five minutes later, but Bucky Jencks 
        '05 knocked in a loose ball at 14:12 to put Bowdoin ahead for good. Bulow 
        added two goals, one off of a free kick, and another off of a brilliant 
        pass from Bart McMann '03. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Over Parents Weekend, Bowdoin continued its winning ways, walking all 
        over the doormat of the NESCAC, the Camels of Connecticut College. Eager 
        to please their parents with a victory, the Polar Bears created numerous 
        scoring opportunities early in the game. The 0-7 Camels, confused and 
        scared, did the only thing they could think off to stop Bowdoin from running 
        all around them: play dirty. <br>
      </p>
      <p>McMann was a victim of the Camels' thuggish play, but was rewarded with 
        a penalty kick that he deposited in the back of the Conn net. Cementing 
        the Polar Bears lead were Tucker Hodgkins '05 and Bulow, who connected 
        off a corner kick for a 2-0 final score.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That Bulow goal was his 13th of the year and the 28th career score, putting 
        him just shy of Bowdoin College records in both categories. The single-season 
        mark, set in 1981 by Kwame Poku, is 14. Gina Asmeron holds the record 
        for most career goals (32).<br>
      </p>
      <p>While certainly aware of the records, Bulow is focused on the NESCAC 
        playoffs and the team's effort to make the NCAA tournament. &quot;We need 
        to win [the last three season games], and if we get some help from Williams, 
        we should finish second in the league,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin's last three matchups, against Colby, Bates, and Wesleyan, should 
        help get the men ready for a NESCAC tournament that will be packed full 
        of tough opponents. On being asked who he would like to face again during 
        the playoffs, captain Patrick Bracewell '02 replied, &quot;I would love 
        to face Williams again&#133;When we played them earlier in the season, 
        it seemed like everything went wrong, and I'd love another shot at them.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Before the Polar Bears get a second chance at Williams, they must face 
        our two biggest rivals, and will surely need your support and encouragement. 
        I implore you all to watch the team play tomorrow at Colby and next Wednesday 
        at Bates. Good luck this weekend men, Go U Bears!<br>
