      <p align="left">How many people have actually purchased the new Jay-Z album? 
        Bootlegs of the record were available well ahead of time, which forced 
        &quot;Jigga&quot; to move up the release date of his album to, coincidentally, 
        September 11th. <i>The Blueprint</i>, Jay-Z's sixth installment, lost 
        some of its luster due to its tragic release date, but the Jigga man treks 
        on with an explanation of himself and his ascent to rap's &quot;superstar&quot; 
        status.<br>

      <p align="left">Several months ago, Jay released his single &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot; 
        using a sample from Jackson 5's &quot;I Want You Back.&quot; By doing 
        so, he added more fuel to the Blueprint fire, and has given party people 
        something to dance about. It was not until Nas came up with a freestyle 
        &quot;dis&quot; called &quot;H to the izzo, M to the izzo (HOMO)&quot; 
        that Jay felt he had something to defend. Jay uses one track on the album 
        entitled, &quot;Takeover,&quot; in order to debase and slander the once 
        renowned poet, Nas Escobar.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Battling other rappers and acting overtly egotistical are 
        ways that Jay-Z is able to maintain his top-dollar status as well as stable 
        profits. However, he manages to step over the line on several occasions. 
        Jay-Z compares himself to Jehovah by distastefully calling himself j-hova, 
        hova and hovito. For the most part, Blueprint is a solo project, with 
        the exception of Jay-Z's collaboration with Biz Markie, Q-Tip and Slick 
        Rick on &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; and with Eminem on a track entitled 
        &quot;Renegade.&quot; However, it's this high level of individualism and 
        condescension that is less prevalent in indie groups and underground artists, 
        but is characteristic of modern mainstream rap. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I have always been a fan of the underground hip-hop scene, 
        giving more respect to the work of such rap artists as Blackstar, Common 
        and Pete Rock, and I don't like the idea that first time listeners to 
        hip hop music will feel that rappers have nothing more to talk about than 
        drinking, pimping, selling and hustling. Something noticeably different, 
        though, from pre-Blueprint albums is Jay-Z's use of street soul and R&amp;B 
        samples over tracks. This organic attitude makes Jay-Z hustling tales 
        more subdued but still meaningful. Especially with such samples from Al 
        Green's &quot;Free at Last&quot; and Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland's &quot;Heart 
        of the City,&quot; Jay-Z has a more earthy, holistically balanced flow. 
        The track, &quot;Heart of the City&quot; is more than enough for me to 
        chill to. Even though I cringe at his choice of topics, Jigga has a well-crafted 
        and distinctive rhythm that is more engaging and deep-seated. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Flashy, street hustling rap artists such as Jay-Z are threats 
        to the whole genre of rap music but, oddly enough, that's the type of 
        rap music that is more profitable and well-known. Jay-Z knows what appeals 
        to the masses, and he capitalizes on this very effectively. Having produced 
        five multi-platinum albums in the past five years, <i>The Blueprint</i> 
        indicates that he hasn't lost his touch. <br>
