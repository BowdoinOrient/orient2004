        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p align="left">One month to the day after the terrorist attacks on New 
        York and Washington, Admiral Michael Ratliffe, USN (ret.) spoke on naval 
        intelligence and its future role in the fight against terrorism. His talk 
        was entitled &quot;What is Victory in Our War Against Terrorism?&quot; 
        As former Director of Naval Intelligence and current Vice President for 
        Programs at the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, Admiral Ratliffe touched 
        upon the importance of human intelligence operations in the battle against 
        terrorism. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">After Admiral Ratliffe's talk, I asked him specifically 
        about human intelligence in light of information that the U.S. recently 
        learned of possible future attacks within the next few days. Ratliffe 
        spoke about the lack of human intelligence operations that we currently 
        have in the United States and the growing need, especially now, to broaden 
        the base of intelligence that agencies have at their disposal. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He stated that many Americans unrealistically want &quot;the 
        end to be as good as the means&quot; in which the U.S. to have a strong 
        national security, without having to use classic intelligence techniques 
        from cold war days such as spying. Questions have arisen concerning how 
        to better obtain intelligence through espionage and wiretapping, along 
        with concerns that civil liberties may be violated and go unnoticed in 
        the process of acquiring such information. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to an article entitled &quot;Testing intelligence&quot; 
        in the October 6, 2001 issue of the Economist, &quot;the Justice Department 
        &#133; turned down an FBI request to put a wiretap on one suspected hijacker. 
        Congress is likely to loosen rules like this which hamper domestic intelligence-gathering.&quot; 
        And in terms of more spies, &quot;until recently, the CIA had neglected 
        its networks in the Middle East. The agency now has fewer Arabic-speaking 
        case officers than in the cold war&#133;&quot; As the article goes on 
        to say &quot;after the (East African) embassy bombings in 1998, a National 
        Commission on Terrorism proposed many changes - for instance, more spies 
        on the ground, looser wiretap authority - that are now being discussed.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But how far should intelligence-gathering be able to go 
        without violating people's liberties? After all as mentioned before, Congress 
        will likely loosen rules for attaining a wiretap. Will that mean innocent 
        people are wiretapped? It's very possible. Law enforcement officials at 
        the beginning of the September 11 terrorism investigation detained many 
        Arabs and Muslims suspecting they too could be involved in a terrorist 
        plot. Some were later arrested, but others were detained for no obvious 
        reason other than shared ethnic similarities with the suspected hijackers. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Whatever the verdict may be, there is certainly a fine line 
        between intelligence-gathering and infringement on people's personal rights. 
        As Admiral Ratliffe reminded the Bowdoin community, the means is not always 
        as good as the end. But as the investigation and search continues for 
        suspected terrorists in the U.S., Afghanistan, and beyond, many Americans 
        are probably willing to give up some of their liberties to avoid another 
        day like September 11.</p>
