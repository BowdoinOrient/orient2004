      <h4 align="left">Question: Do you think athletics are too prominent at Bowdoin?</h4>
      <p>Of the colleges in the New England Small College Athletic Conference 
        (NESCAC), Bowdoin boasts some pretty impressive athletic statistics. Over 
        fifty percent of male undergraduates in the 1998-1999 school year participated 
        in varsity athletics, and a little under forty percent of the female students 
        played on a varsity team. These numbers give Bowdoin the highest percentage 
        of undergraduate varsity athletes in the NESCAC, above Williams, Colby, 
        Amherst, Middlebury, and all the rest. The numbers alone show that Bowdoin 
        College overemphasizes athletics.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The focus on athletics goes against the very goals of the Bowdoin Admissions 
        Department. We have all discussed the need to diversify Bowdoin's student 
        body, and Admissions continues to work hard to attract minority students 
        and students from outside of the New England region. Yet with all the 
        talk of the diversifying the student body, Bowdoin continues to have a 
        blind spot for athletes. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I am not saying that athletes are one-dimensional and do not contribute 
        to the school in a variety of ways. I am merely asking why we don't recruit 
        musicians, artists, dancers, and actors as actively as we recruit athletes.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The prominence of athletics is evident in the facilities on campus as 
        well. Bowdoin has two gyms, an indoor track, a football field, an Olympic-sized 
        swimming pool, tennis courts, a fitness center, and not one, but two buildings 
        that have squash courts. The Music Department is contained to one small 
        building with very limited practice space and only one rehearsal room 
        where the Concert Band, MidCoast Symphony Orchestra, Polar Jazz Band, 
        and various other ensemble groups practice. There is also no concert hall 
        on campus, meaning that the various music ensembles are forced to compete 
        for space in Kresge Auditorium (which is not acoustically designed for 
        musical performances), Pickard Theater (home of Theater and Dance), and 
        the Chapel (adjoined to the Psychology Department's offices, meaning no 
        rehearsals until after 4:00 p.m.). Bowdoin is an academic college, yet 
        it seems some of its academic departments receive less attention and funding 
        than its Athletic Department. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I hope in the future Bowdoin reevaluates its priorities. I love going 
        to a hockey game as much as anybody else, but Bowdoin needs a better balance 
        of activities, and more specifically, a better balance in funding.<br>
      </p>

      <p>Athletics bring diversity and liveliness to the Bowdoin campus. Athletes 
        need athletics to excel in academics because athletics put a constraint 
        on time that forces athletes to be disciplined about how they spend their 
        time. Juggling multiple commitments is a huge part of life and by saying 
        athletics are too prominent, it implies that Bowdoin students should postpone 
        dealing with that balancing act until after college, devoting all of their 
        efforts to the classroom. This will not help with living in the real world. 
        Furthermore, physical activity keeps a person happy and healthy.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-Amanda Cowen '03 </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Relatively speaking, for a small liberal arts college, Bowdoin has an 
        albeit high percentage of student-athletes. However, I do not exactly 
        agree that they &quot;are too prominent.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Because Bowdoin draws a large number of relatively active athletic students, 
        it might seem that the prominence of athletes on our small campus overshadows 
        that of other activities. Nonetheless, if athletics seem &quot;too prominent,&quot; 
        this is a remark more on our greater society. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Athletics are prominent in our general culture because individuals, &quot;spectators,&quot; 
        and fans follow such activities. As a SOCIETY, we have determined the 
        importance of athletics; for this reason, nearly every national paper 
        includes a sports-section. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, it seems that the only way to diminish the prominence of athletes 
        on this campus would be to reduce the publicity that it receives. <br>
      </p>
      <p>-Kristin Pollock '04 </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I don't think that athletics are too prominent at Bowdoin. At any other 
        institution of a comparable quality of education (Colby, Middlebury), 
        athletics are in my opinion a bigger deal than they are here at Bowdoin. 
        Even schools with more alternative inclinations (Vassar, Wesleyan) have 
        top-notch and competitive athletic programs. Furthermore, at top-tier 
        universities (Harvard, Yale, Stanford), athletics are a focal point for 
        the student body. Did you know that at most of these schools the athletic 
        functions are not only well-attended, but the students pay to see them? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>If Bowdoin athletics really were too prominent, we would have to charge 
        people to get in, rather than beg them to come.<br>
      </p>

      <p>The aspect of athletics at Bowdoin is absolutely not too prominent, but 
        integral. A healthy mind requires a healthy body, and athletics provide 
        an outlet for success, health, stress-relief, and gaining new skills. 
        Here at Bowdoin, there is definitely not a lack in academic success for 
        students, even top athletes. Bowdoin students have a healthy balance between 
        schoolwork and other activities, be it the arts, athletics, community 
        service, other clubs, etc. Time spent in athletics, I find, is also helpful 
        for gaining time-management skills. Athletics are just one of the many 
        extra-curricular activities that keep students healthy, involved, and 
        well-rounded.<br>
      </p>
      <p>-Jessica Burke '04 </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I do not think that athletics are too prominent at Bowdoin. As over 70% 
        of the student population voluntarily chooses to participate in some form 
        of athletics, I feel as if athletics represent an integral part of Bowdoin's 
        personality and integrity. If anything, I feel as if athletics are UNDERVALUED, 
        relative to some other aspects of the Bowdoin life.<br>
