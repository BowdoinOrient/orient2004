      <p align="left">Lured by the call of pastabilities, the ferocious foodies 
        ventured toward the end of Maine Street expecting a gondola tour of some 
        Italian territory. However, the foodies found themselves in an environment 
        not quite Italian and not of their time. Shivering, they were quickly 
        seated in a nether region with chefly murmurings and stoneware clinking 
        in the background, and they thawed amidst the cozy booths as they studied 
        the menu. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The foodies and their friend immersed themselves in the 
        detailed dish descriptions and found themselves gravitating thoughtlessly 
        to familiar choices. Over steaming garlic bread--possibly of Pillsbury 
        origin--marinated in a blend of butters, the foodies eagerly anticipated 
        the arrival of their meals. <br>

      <p align="left">Foodie one consumed a simple side salad that is available 
        with all entrees and the m&eacute;lange included meat, cheese, and croutons 
        that livened up an otherwise standard iceberg base. Savoring a portobello 
        salad, Foodie two proved wiser than her colleague. Steeped in balsalmic 
        vinegar, the tender fungus lay delicately upon a succulent couch of spinach. 
        Pine nuts paraded softly atop the orgy of flavors. Foodie one gazed longingly 
        and quietly ate a carrot shred, while Foodie two attempted to conceal 
        her superiority. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Shortly thereafter, the foodies received their main meals. 
        Kerry became confused--she knew that she was in an Italian restaurant, 
        and she was aware that she was actually in the United States. However, 
        she did not realize that Maine is a member of the Confederacy, for her 
        &quot;risotto&quot; arrived as a colonial mash of patriotic grits. A southern 
        Grandmother would greatly approve of her nutritious choice, for no spices 
        would jar her stomach and no exotic flavors would tempt her wanderlust. 
        The grilled shrimp and vegetables laying limp atop the downy pillow proved 
        only slightly more satisfying. The foodie friend only gazed distraught 
        upon her veal-- baby cow just doesn't look as nice on plates as it does 
        on milk cartons. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Finally, the tables had turned. Foodie one looked enviously 
        upon foodie two's entree. Upon her sizzling platter lay a vegetable tapestry: 
        tender eggplant--an unappreciated amethyst orb-was paired with luscious 
        cheese and slippery baby produce. The dish was devoured guiltily and with 
        few sound effects, for Foodie one did not want to inspire the covetous 
        wrath of her dinner companions. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Desert was an egalitarian event. Foodie two and friend savored 
        tiramisu and mousse cake, while Foodie one selfishly hoarded her own portion 
        of latte and biscotti. The tiramisu was not Italian in origin, for the 
        sweet layers of whipped cream and sponge cake mocked the pretentious delicacy 
        of lady fingers and coffee. The mousse cake, smoother than the cellulite 
        free derri&egrave;res of the foodies, soon would disrupt the harmony of 
        taught arses. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The foodies barely maneuvered themselves out of the restaurant 
        and would remember both the highlights and pitfalls of the inconsistent 
        yet oddly charming establishment; when dining here, the experience can 
        be one of several pastabilities. <br>
