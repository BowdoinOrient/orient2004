      <p> It was Saturday night on Parent's Weekend, and my family and I decided 
        to go to the movies. The popcorn was so buttery I used up all my napkins 
        before the movie even started. My high-school bound brother wanted my 
        family to go back home right after the movie to study for an upcoming 
        chem test. Sigh&#133;.<br>
      </p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Two and a half hours later, we all walked out of <i>Bandits</i> smiling. 
        I realized I had actually eaten the entire bag of drippy popcorn, my brother 
        realized that stoichiometry could wait, and we all had dinner at Thorne. 
        Thank you, <i>Bandits</i>. You made my family forget their responsibilities&#133;.<br>
      </p>
      <p>How'd it do it? Maybe because it was about a couple of really nice bad 
        guys; which can be surprisingly refreshing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) and Terry Collins (Billy Bob Thornton) are the 
        two most successful bank robbers in America. Dubbed the &quot;Sleepover 
        Bandits,&quot; they rob banks after spending the night at their manager's 
        house, in hopes of getting enough money to live in paradise in Mexico. 
        Everything goes smoothly until Kate (Cate Blanchett) meets up with them 
        and forces them to confront each other and themselves. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Joe and Terry are good guys, but then again they're bank robbers--it's 
        this little paradox that makes the movie tick. Deep down, they can't hurt 
        anyone. A cute little grandma bank manager knows this from the TV reports 
        and refuses to give them money. Helpless in the face of truth, Terry turns 
        to Joe and shrugs, &quot;I'm stumped.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Which reminds me--some things have to be said about the director. Barry 
        Levinson has had his confusing ups and downs. <i>Rain Man </i>and <i>Wag 
        the Dog</i>--that was some good stuff. <i>Toys</i> and <i>Sphere</i>--hmmm&#133; 
        yeah, pretty darn bad. One cool thing does seem to keep showing up in 
        his movies--character studies-and <i>Bandits</i> follows this tradition.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Billy Bob Thornton has bad teeth, sounds a bit like Harry Carey, and 
        is growing weirder with age. But, as my brother and his best friend put 
        it best, &quot;The guy's a god.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; I responded, &quot;cause 
        he's a good actor?&quot; &quot;No&#133;.&quot; An awkward pause. &quot;He's 
        married to Angelina Jolie.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Point taken.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But anyway, the guy can act. Although Billy clearly steals the show with 
        his hilarious side antics; Bruce complements him well. We, as an audience 
        of people who would never dream of robbing banks, admire his audacity 
        and unpredictability. But Bruce has played similar characters before, 
        so his performance is not quite so impressive.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Kate comes into the story by hitting Terry with her car instead of stopping 
        for him to &quot;borrow&quot; it. Then she falls in love with both of 
        them because together they are &quot;the perfect man.&quot; She's their 
        undoing and as Terry explains, &quot;She's an iceberg waiting for the 
        Titanic.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>As for the genre, this movie doesn't really fall into any specific category. 
        It's intellectually hilarious, carelessly criminal, and adorably touching--call 
        it a romantic comedy crime film. That way, it conveniently passes both 
        the guy movie and the chick flick test. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Oh, and keep your eyes open for the ending&#133; it's a good one. <br>
