        STAFF WRITER</font></p>
      <p>Parents and visiting friends cheered on the women ruggers last Saturday 
        at Bowdoin's most difficult match of season. The Bear A-side squad defeated 
        the University of Rhode Island's A-side by a score of 25-15, and solidified 
        its first-place standing in the New England Rugby Football Union. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The ruggers got off to a slow start, but as time passed and weather conditions 
        worsened, the team pulled together for the win. Rhode Island brought visible 
        fervor to the game, but with its sloppy presentation, players made several 
        poor and potentially dangerous high tackles. &quot;It was a very physical 
        game, but URI had poor technical skills,&quot; captain Katharine Buckspan 
        '02 said. &quot;Bowdoin's tackling in the past two weeks is better then 
        it has been in years.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>While aggression from Rhode Island disrupted the back-line's offense, 
        Bowdoin managed the ball with skill and precision.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Junior Nachel Mathoda scored the match's first try after about 15 minutes 
        in the first half, igniting the Bear offense. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="left" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

            Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>In one of the most successful plays of the half, junior Camilla Yamada 
        scored on a breakaway following her famous &quot;8-man pick-up,&quot; 
        from which she has scored several times. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Jess Bergen scored the third try. By the end of the half, the 
        score was 15-10 in favor of Bowdoin. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Rhode Island &quot;out-rucked,&quot; or dominated in physical pushing, 
        the Bears in the second half, but the Bowdoin ruggers proved more in shape 
        as Rhode Island became tired.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin scored two more tries in the second half, and Rhode Island notched 
        another on a breakaway. Senior Julie Thompson earned conversion points, 
        making several kicks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin was successful in several different plays, including some impressive 
        runs by sophomore Liz Swedock (from a &quot;good-clown&quot; penalty play), 
        Yamada's 8-man pick-up specialty, and a new lineout technique where players 
        are lifted by the jumper's thighs, not shorts, for a higher lift. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The Rhode Island A-side provided aggressive opposition last Saturday, 
        boosting Bowdoin's level of play. The more technical game brought by the 
        Bowdoin women prevailed, however, and earned the Bears a 25-15 win.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Following the A-side game, Bowdoin played a B-side game with Rhode Island, 
        but had to lend quite a few players to the URI B-side due to a lack of 
        numbers. With players being &quot;traded,&quot; all of the Bowdoin B-side 
        members got some extra playing time. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With just two games left in the season, Bowdoin is looking to make the 
        New England Divisional playoffs in November. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Currently second to the undefeated Bears in the rankings are the Jumbos 
        from Tufts (4-0-1). Bowdoin does not play Tufts in the regular season, 
        but has a good chance of facing the team in playoff matches. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This Saturday, the ruggers play their final away game at Northeastern. 
        The following weekend, Bowdoin plays Wellesley, its biggest women's rugby 
        rival, at home. Be sure to come and support the Women's Rugby Team next 
        week Saturday, October 27 for the final and most exciting game of the 
        season!</p>
