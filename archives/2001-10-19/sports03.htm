      <p>Football head coach Dave Caputi earned his first Bowdoin win Saturday 
        afternoon, as the Polar Bears dominated the first half and fourth quarter 
        of the Parents Weekend game en route to a 23-14 win over Hamilton. &quot;It 
        feels great,&quot; Caputi said. &quot;I'm so happy for the men, especially 
        for the seniors...people started to doubt them, but they never gave up.&quot;<br>
      </p>

          <td><font size="2">Kevin Bougie '04 in action yesterday. The Bears defeated 
            Hamilton, 23-14, for their first win in exactly two years. (Henry

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The win had a special significance for the seniors, as it broke Bowdoin's 
        15 game losing streak. &quot;It was a great feeling,&quot; said senior 
        running back Mike Taylor. &quot;Everything is measured by wins and losses, 
        so until now, no one could tell how hard we've been working every day.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>This determination was displayed last Saturday in front of an overflowing 
        crowd of Bowdoin parents and fans. The crowd loudly supported the Polar 
        Bears throughout the game. &quot;They were great,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;We 
        had a lot of people there cheering for us. It was like having a twelfth 
        player on the field.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Taylor had a career-high 97 rushing yards, including a three-yard touchdown 
        run for the Bears. Two oft-overlooked groups had breakout performances 
        as well: the offensive line outworked the Continental defensive, creating 
        open holes for Taylor and Kevin Bougie '04, whose five-yard touchdown 
        in the second gave Bowdoin a 14-0 advantage. Also, the Polar Bear defense 
        set the tone in the game's first minutes as they sent the Hamilton offense 
        back to the bench after three plays.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Led by eight tackles from sophomore Jeb Bordeau and the punishing hits 
        made by Leroy Gaines '02 and Jarrett Young '05, the defense made virtually 
        every big play during the game. No play, however, was bigger than junior 
        Sean Starke's interception return for a touchdown with four minutes remaining 
        in the game.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;&quot;I was able to read the quarterback's throw,&quot; Starkes 
        said. &quot;It was one of the greatest thrills in my athletic career.&quot; 
        His 63-yard return down the right sideline sent the Bowdoin bench and 
        cheering section into uproar.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The defensive line rushed Hamilton quarterback Greg LiVigne all afternoon; 
        pressure which led LiVigne to throw four interceptions. Jamie Nichols 
        '03 picked up two, while Ivan Lucuk '04 and Starke grabbed one each. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Young was selected as NESCAC's Rookie of the Week after delivering a 
        stellar defensive effort. &quot;I was completely shocked, but it's a great 
        honor,&quot; said Young, who recorded five tackles and two sacks in the 
        game. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Young, a St. Louis native, attributed much of his success this season 
        to team chemistry. &quot;We have great continuity,&quot; he said. &quot;The 
        seniors treat all of the players equally, which makes everyone want to 
        win for them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>As the Continentals trudged back to their bench at the game's end, the 
        Bowdoin players raised their helmets in the air as several rowdy Bowdoin 
        fans rushed the field. Caputi betrayed his usually even demeanor with 
        a smile as he followed the players into the tunnel.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're going to build on the good things we did last Saturday as 
        we prepare for Trinity,&quot; said Caputi. &quot;We still have to cut 
        down on some mental mistakes.&quot;<br>
        These mistakes might have caused the game to slip away from the Bears, 
        as the Continentals erased a 14-0 halftime deficit in the third quarter. 
        A field goal from John Rock '05 was the only Polar Bear score during that 
        quarter. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton would not get any closer than 17-14, however, as Starke provided 
        the game's decisive play in the fourth quarter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Bowdoin men savored their weekend win, but, by Monday, they<br>
        were back to work. &quot;We're working on the execution of a lot of small 
        things, and mentally preparing ourselves for Trinity,&quot; said Young.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Polar Bears look to build upon their success this weekend, facing 
        the 2-2 Bantams on the road. No matter what happens tomorrow, it will 
        be a long time before Bowdoin fans forget the excitement they felt as 
        Sean Starke sprinted down the sideline last Saturday, erasing the frustration 
        of the longest losing streak in school history.</p>
