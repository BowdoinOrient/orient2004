      <p align="left">My mother told me yesterday that she wasn't going to decorate 
        our house for Halloween this year. Some people might say that it's not 
        such a big deal. Lots of people don't decorate, but in the past, Halloween 
        has been a really big day for us. We would start several weeks ahead of 
        time making bags filled with anything my mother could find on the shelves 
        of every store she visited. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our street has always been very popular with Trick-or-Treat 
        goers of all ages. Even if my mother made 300 bags, they were invariably 
        gone within a matter of two short hours, if not less. We would have dinner 
        on that night in the dining room, all of us in costume, ready to run to 
        the door when it rang. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We have a laughing witch who stands right outside our door 
        every year, projecting her infernal laughter that drives me crazy for 
        the two or three weeks that she is plugged in. Every year I swear that 
        she will not be plugged in, and every year, her laughter returns. That 
        is, until now. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Instead, our door will be adorned with a note, informing 
        visitors that we have not decorated the house, nor bought candy, because 
        of the events of the past month and a half. As my mother explained her 
        reasoning, I cringed, thinking that the worse thing we can do is let the 
        tragedy reach our spirits. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While my family may not observe Halloween this year, I know 
        we will celebrate Thanksgiving, and I can't help but wonder what the great 
        difference is. It would seem that now is a perfect time to celebrate Halloween, 
        which is, after all, a descendent of a religious festival for the dead. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I suppose the difference rests in the fact that people don't 
        usually consider the history of Halloween as part of its celebration. 
        To children and parents everywhere, it is simply a time to go get dressed 
        up, go out with friends and acquire as much candy as possible. It should 
        be more than that. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Right now is the start of the festive season, as the leaves 
        are turning and falling, as it gets darker earlier, as we start looking 
        for those sweaters. Even if celebration seems almost out of place, we 
        owe it to ourselves and to all those who have died and suffered to carry 
        on the spirit, whether we are Christian, Jewish, Muslim or pagan.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We ought to celebrate, but not with same merry carelessness 
        that has become quite characteristic of this season. It should be a time 
        during which we enjoy being together, sharing memories and traditions, 
        but it is only appropriate that we spend even more time reflecting on 
        our lives and places in this world.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In her column in the New York Times last week, Maureen Dowd 
        proclaimed that the terrorists are &quot;trying to drag us back to the 
        Middle Ages.&quot; I'd like to suggest that they haven't taken us that 
        far. Our present concerns seem to have more of a semblance with the Baroque- 
        the irregularity and prevalence of a seemingly unconquerable tension of 
        opposites. We want our lives to return to normalcy, but at the same time, 
        we don't really think they can. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We would best be served, I think, in listening to those 
        two different pulls, and adopting as ours the Baroque period's two favorite 
        sayings &quot;carpe diem&quot; and &quot;momento mori&quot;- seize the 
        day, but remember that you must die. We have to maintain a strong enthusiasm 
        for life, without forgetting just how vulnerable we are. In the union 
        of opposites, we can find a common balance that will set the proper tone 
        for the future. </p>
