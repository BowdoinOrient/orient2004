        <font size="2">J.P. BOX<br>
        ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR</font></p>
      <p align="left">You know that NBA Commissioner David Stern was excited when 
        Michael Jordan announced his comeback. Before Stern struck up this deal 
        with the devil, his cry to fans was &quot;Hey! We got new zone defenses 
        to improve team work!&quot;</p>
      <p>The NBA's new slogan is &quot;Hey! We got Michael Jordan.&quot; Although 
        NBC, ESPN, and BCN will only be showing Wizards' games, there are actually 
        a lot of other bona fide stars and story lines to follow.</p>
      <p>So, for those of you who are not interested in watching streamlined videos 
        of Jordan dunking during pregame warm-ups, eating his pregame meal of 
        steak and fries, or posing in his Haine's briefs, this is your preseason 
        guide to the NBA season.</p>
      <p>In the Eastern Conference (yes, that is where the Wizards play), the 
        Orlando Magic are the clear favorite. Fueled by heart and hustle, Orlando 
        nearly scrapped their way into the playoffs during the '99-'00 season. 
        While they were big on heart, a lack of talent ultimately erased any chance 
        of seriously contending for a championship.</p>
      <p>During the offseason, however, the Magic shelled out some serious bucks 
        to land Tracy McGrady and Grant Hill. A bum ankle forced Hill to miss 
        most of the season, but T-Mac soared averaging 27 points per game and 
        established himself as one of the premier shooting guards in the league.</p>
      <p>Propelled by McGrady's sudden rise to stardom, the Magic fought their 
        way to a 43-39 record and earned a playoff berth.</p>
      <p>With a healthy Grant Hill and the addition of Patrick Ewing, the Magic 
        will cruise their way to the top of an injury-ridden and talent-lacking 
        Eastern Conference.</p>
      <p>But, what about the Knickerbockers, Heat, 76'ers, Hornets, and Bucks? 
        Please. With the exception of the 76'ers, all of those teams would be 
        clawing and fighting desperately for a playoff spot in the Western Conference.</p>
      <p>And the sleeper of the East? The Atlanta Hawks will emerge as one of 
        the premier teams in this weak conference. Last year, the Hawks ended 
        the season at 25-57, which was the third worst record in the league.</p>
      <p>This year, however, Toni Kukoc, Jason Terry, and Theo Ratliff will push 
        this team out of the cellar and into playoff contention.</p>
      <p>In the Western Conference, however, the picture is not as clear. Although 
        the Spurs, Mavericks, Kings, and Lakers are more talented than any team 
        in the East, they will not win the Western crown.</p>
      <p>The lucky winner? The Phoenix Suns. Imagine this back court-Stephon Marbury 
        and Penny Hardaway. Their forwards aren't too shabby either with Shawn 
        Marion, Tom Gugliotta, and Rodney Rogers leading the charge down low. 
      </p>
      <p>The only question mark is Penny's health and Iakovos Tsakalidis' production 
        at center. After partaking in Jordan's private practices over the summer, 
        Hardaway claims that he is healthy and ready to play like the super star 
        he was with Orlando. </p>
      <p>Tsakalidis, on the other, is only a second year player and never established 
        himself last year as a legitimate center. At 7'2&quot; and 285 pounds, 
        Tsakalidis should be able to slow down Shaq, Duncan, and Robinson - which 
        is all Suns will need from him.</p>
      <p>And the sleeper of the West? The Los Angeles Clippers. With the addition 
        of Elton Brandt from the Bulls, the Clips have the chance to become the 
        premier Los Angeles basketball team. At the very least, sportscasters 
        and fans will not refer to Lakers simply as &quot;L.A.&quot; - it's a 
        two team town now.</p>
      <p>And now the stage is set for the NBA finals - Suns vs. Magic. T-Mac and 
        Hill may steal a game, but the Suns will shine to take the title in a 
        short series.</p>
      <p>Attentive readers, are you satisfied with this analysis? Did my sans-Jordan 
        preview get you pumped? Me neither.</p>
      <p>With Air Jordan returning this year, there are only four match-ups that 
        really matter to fans. Who was I kidding?</p>
      <p>Match-up #4 - Michael vs. Vince Carter. During his retirement, Jordan 
        openly criticized Carter's game. According to His Airness, Vince doesn't 
        have the heart or the quickness to play defense. When the two meet this 
        season, Vince will be vying to prove the old man wrong. Advantage: Michael.</p>
      <p>Match-up #3 - Michael vs. Tracy McGrady. McGrady's size and quickness 
        could potentially embarrass the aging and smaller and slower Jordan. However, 
        McGrady skipped college and only has four years of NBA experience. Jordan 
        meanwhile enjoyed lengthy, successful careers at the college and NBA level. 
        Advantage: Michael.</p>
      <p>Match-up #2 - Michael vs. Allen Iverson. Even though it would be fun 
        to watch, I would be surprised if these two ever play straight up. If 
        they did, Allen would dribble circles around Michael and toast him for 
        50 points. Jordan would back down the over-matched Iverson in the post 
        and scorch him for 50 points. Advantage: Equal.</p>
      <p>Match-up #1: Michael vs. Kobe. Before Jordan hung up his sneakers three 
        years ago, he passed the torch to Bryant - urging him to continue his 
        aggressive style and always believe in his abilities. Three years later, 
        Jordan's protoge will take on Jordan himself. Kobe's defense is equally 
        tenacious and his offense is equally as effective. Plus, he is 15 years 
        younger than Michael. Advantage: Kobe.</p>
