      <p align="left"><font size="5">Coaches question NESCAC report's findings</font><br>
        <font size="2">BELINDA J. LOVETT</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a statement accompanying the &quot;Academic-Athletic 
        Divide&quot; report released last week, the NESCAC presidents wrote, &quot;While 
        we admire the achievements and talents of our student athletes and reaffirm 
        the educational value of athletic competition, we are concerned that the 
        competitive pressures of intercollegiate athletics&#133;risk distorting 
        the place and purpose of athletic participation in our institutions.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the statement, the presidents' goal is to fully 
        conform to the values of the NESCAC conference, as well as to the educational 
        missions of individual schools.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The statement and report are a result of athletic vs. academic 
        concerns that were raised after the publication of the book The Game of 
        Life, written by William Bowen and James Shulman.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the report, athletes have an admissions advantage 
        over non-athletes, even though athletes tend to have lower academic scores. 
        In addition, many athletes tend to be ranked lower in their class and 
        perform under the level of non-athletes.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, the report, though, has received mixed reactions 
        among administrators, coaches, and students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Director of Athletics Jeff Ward said, &quot;There are certainly 
        things in it that I think I disagree pretty strongly with&#133;I think 
        it is very hurtful to coaches and athletes for people to say, 'Do you 
        belong here?'&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Several coaches also expressed their skepticism of the findings 
        of the report.<br>
        David Caputi, head coach of the football team, said, &quot;I don't agree 
        with it&#133;I think the report was irresponsible.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Caputi pointed out several areas in which he thought the 
        report was misleading. He said that the report failed to completely acknowledge 
        that coaches screen athletes for their academic qualifications before 
        they are ever placed on an admissions list. Caputi said that this caused 
        the statistics relating to the admissions preference given to athletes 
        over non-athletes to be inaccurate. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Caputi also mentioned his concern for the recruited-athlete 
        data, since all schools recruit in different ways. He said that he believed 
        that the report didn't give answers, but rather raised more questions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I'm fearful of any schools making changes in policy 
        based on a report,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Gil Birney, head coach of the men's and women's crew teams, 
        said, &quot;If the problem identified by the report is that athletes aren't 
        working up to potential, I wonder if that is particularly peculiar to 
        athletes&#133;I suspect the larger potential problem raised by the report 
        is a sense of antagonism or suspicion about groups of people, rather than 
        an appreciation of what people have to offer the community.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Terrence Meagher, coach of the men's ice hockey team and 
        the men's and women's golf teams, was also skeptical of the report. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said, &quot;It is my hope that an objective person 
        or group will thoroughly analyze the material to make sure that the conclusions 
        are accurate and fairly represent the role of intercollegiate athletics 
        in the NESCAC conference.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Administrators, though, did not express concern with the 
        validity of the report.<br>
        Dean for Academic Affairs Craig McEwen said that he thought the commissioning 
        of the report was &quot;an enormously positive sign.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He said, &quot;In a sense, it's unusual and rather courageous 
        for a group of colleges to examine themselves and expose themselves seriously 
        on issues that are highly sensitive and difficult&#133;I think until The 
        Game of Life was published, we were probably individually and collectively 
        less self-aware of the trade-offs that might be involved in those choices.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dean of Student Affairs Craig Bradley said that since he 
        had already read The Game of Life, he wasn't surprised by the report.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He said, &quot;The principle thing is the academic experience, 
        and we need to always remember that. We certainly don't want people coming 
        into the place who are unprepared to thrive within the classroom here 
        and contribute to the place in all respects.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The NESCAC presidents have begun looking into several different 
        paths to possible reform. The presidents at Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan 
        are looking into admissions and recruiting; the presidents at Colby and 
        Bates, along with President Barry Mills, are looking into the allocation 
        of financial resources to athletic departments. In addition, Mills and 
        the presidents at Trinity and Middlebury are talking with the president 
        at Carlton about possibly moving into division IIIA or IV.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mills said that the presidents hoped to reconvene in December 
        to talk about the different areas and then to meet again in May to discuss 
        some actual proposals.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mills said, &quot;I think it was a good start for the presidents 
        to sit around the room and acknowledge that we were committed to these 
        principles, and I assume everyone is acting in good faith and is serious 
        about this, and so I am cautiously optimistic that people will do a rigorous 
        analysis of this and figure out what's best for the league. And then, 
        we've got to figure out what's best for Bowdoin.&quot;<br>
        Similar &quot;cautious optimism&quot; was expressed by other administrators 
        and coaches as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bradley said, &quot;The whole conference can say, 'We're 
        going to place greater emphasis on academic qualification at the expense 
        of athletic talent across the board in some systematic way,'&#133;but 
        at the end of the day, you're not sure if everybody's going to play along.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Caputi also said that there was a need for more of a league-wide 
        commitment to &quot;numbers,&quot; and said, &quot;Everybody we're playing 
        with isn't playing by the same rules.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mills said that without complete NESCAC cooperation, &quot;it 
        would be very hard for Bowdoin to take drastic steps and then still have 
        an expectation that we're going to be able to compete in a league that 
        hasn't made such drastic steps.&quot;<br>
        The coaches emphasized that they are aware of the position of athletics 
        in a liberal arts education, as are the student-athletes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ward said, &quot;The Bowdoin student athletes that I know, 
        the quality of education was incredibly important to them in making their 
        decision of where to go to college, and I am really proud of them, and 
        I think they represent the College well.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Birney said, &quot;That academics comes first is clearly 
        understood and broadly supported by our coaches.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Timothy Gilbride, coach of the men's basketball team, did 
        not think that there was a necessary tradeoff between academics and athletics. 
        He said, &quot;The academic mission of the College is paramount in all 
        we do. However, there is no need for athletic performance to suffer in 
        order for students to perform well in the classroom&#133;.Rather than 
        detracting from the academic mission of the College, I feel strongly that 
        athletic participation enhances this mission.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The NESCAC schools include Bowdoin, Williams, Amherst, Bates, 
        Colby, Connecticut College, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, and 
        Wesleyan.<br>
