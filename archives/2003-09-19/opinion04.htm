      <p align="left"><font size="5">New GOP targets?<br></font>
        <font size="2">BRYANT ANTHONY RICH<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></p>
      <p align="left"> A new generation in politics is upon us and anything is 
        possible. The Democrats are forced to realign themselves and prove to 
        the political middle that they are not a bunch of tax and spend liberals. 
        The Republicans must prove that they are no longer merely the party of 
        big business and the religious right. Perhaps one of the most interesting 
        phenomena of the current political climate is that both parties are clamoring 
        for the support of what is, for now, a count-before-the-vote-is-cast-constituency: 
        African Americans. </p>
      <p>As the African American electorate ages, fewer and fewer African Americans 
        remember the glory days of the civil rights movement. This means that 
        Democrats lose their hold on valuable political capital and that Republicans 
        have the opportunity to win this group over. </p>
      <p>Despite all the history behind African Americans and the Democratic Party, 
        it is still highly possible for Republicans to gain Black votes. Though 
        the Democrats are traditionally viewed as being pro-minority, many Latinos 
        identify with the Republican Party. The rapport between Democrats and 
        Latinos is not as strong as that of Democrats and Blacks because of the 
        perennial question in politics: &quot;What have you done for me, lately?&quot;</p>
      <p>Recently, the list is sparse for both parties. As African Americans become 
        wealthier and more influential, it has become more and more attractive 
        for them to become members of the party with the most wealthy and influential 
        people, regardless of whether or not the party originally supported civil 
        rights in the 60s and 70s.</p>
      <p>No matter how hard it is to believe that African Americans could or would 
        vote en masse for members of the party whose influential leaders include 
        Trent Lott and the late Strom Thurmond, it is becoming increasingly possible, 
        especially as the Democrats fail to court this valuable constituency. 
        In a national meeting of the NAACP, specifically with the purpose of introducing 
        democratic candidates to black voters, only six of the nine candidates 
        showed. Those absent were Senator Joseph Lieberman of my home state of 
        Connecticut, representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Dennis 
        J. Kucinich of Ohio. These candidates did assure the NAACP that they did 
        not intend to offend black voters, that this was merely a scheduling conflict. 
        They also attempted to make up for the gaffe by attending another meeting. 
        Meanwhile President Bush has addressed another influential group of African 
        Americans, the Urban League, in Philadelphia. The NAACP reserved a seat 
        on stage for President Bush at the meeting that the infamous three Democrats 
        missed, he did not attend either and never has attended an NAACP meeting. 
      </p>
      <p>African American votes will most likely be, in the near future, up for 
        grabs. This electorate will probably split, not quite in half, but possibly 
        60/40 or 70/30 in favor of the Democrats. The 40 percent nor 30 percent 
        that vote Republican will mostly be more affluent in essence the African 
        American electorate will vote more like the rest of the country as their 
        political interests diversify more because of their increased prosperity 
        and less emphasis is placed upon political history. </p>
      <p>Another aspect to consider is that the African Electorate becomes more 
        important when the parties must jockey for their votes, and this is a 
        good thing. While I do not consider the Reverend Al Sharpton to be a legitimate 
        political contender (or one of my favorite candidates) his candidacy, 
        as described by the candidate himself, has a far more important goal than 
        winning this election. Reverend Sharpton has observed that since the Reverend 
        Jesse Jackson (also not one of my favorites) stopped running for president, 
        the main stream of the Democratic Party has ignored the needs of the African 
        American electorate. Sharpton's run in the primary forces the main stream 
        Democrats to pursue black voters vigorously. </p>
      <p>How does this particular African American Democrat feel about the situation? 
        I suppose that I am a bit torn. As a child of parents with conflicting 
        party affiliations, I feel as though my political views are more a reflection 
        of the issues that I believe in rather than a collective voting tradition 
        such as the one generally embraced by most African Americans. In other 
        words, issues like balanced budgets, limited (and intelligent) social 
        welfare programs, strong defense, civil rights and liberties (for minorities 
        and homosexuals), continued regulation of media ownership, separation 
        of church and state as well as tactful diplomacy are all important to 
        me. Therefore, I choose to vote Democrat. <br>
