      <p align="left">Sometime back in the long history of Bowdoin College, a 
        professor said that the Chapel &quot;has been the pride for each successive 
        generation of Bowdoin students.&quot;</p>

      Nearly 150 years later, construction superintendent Mike Boucher and his 
      team of 15 men are working stone-by-stone to ensure that the Chapel overlooks 
      the students peering up at it from the Quad for decades, and perhaps centuries, 
      to come.
<p>Although students here might not realize it, the crew's work is ahead 
        of schedule. Right now, the crew is tearing down the South tower, which 
        overlooks the Appleton dormitory, while building up the North tower at 
        the same time. The bulk of the work on the North should be complete by 
        mid-October, and the South could be halfway rebuilt by the end of the 
        year.</p>
      <p>&quot;We should be pretty much wrapped up at the end of July,&quot; said 
        Boucher. Finishing touches will still take place after that, but most 
        of the $6 million project should be done.</p>
      <p>Consigli Construction has a 15-man crew doing everything from transporting 
        blocks to removing stones to doing masonry on the peak of the North tower. 
        Their task involves nearly 5,000 granite blocks and mammoth pillars. They 
        will completely reconstruct the two towers, which began to crumble after 
        150 years of harsh Maine winters. Boucher and his crew need to make the 
        new towers structurally sound while changing the historic exterior as 
        little as possible.</p>
      <p>To do this, they use modern materials on the inside of the structure, 
        but reuse most of the old granite blocks visible from the outside. When 
        the crew deconstructs a tower, each stone is cataloged. The stones are 
        numbered in accordance with a map, and when the new tower is built, the 
        crew tries to use as many of the old stones as possible.</p>
      <p>The North Tower, which is nearing completion, has a total of 2,412 exterior 
        stones. Only about 350 of those stones are new; the rest are the originals. 
        Even the new granite comes from the same quarry that the old stones came 
        from. The exteriors of the new blocks, which are smooth, will be degraded 
        so that they fit in with the rest of the structure.</p>
      <p>Inside the towers are huge supports to hold the structure in place. One 
        of the pillars weighs 49,000 pounds. In the old towers, there was simply 
        a layer of sand between the interior supports and the exterior blocks. 
        That is all changing, according to Boucher. In addition to the new supports 
        and blocks, advanced materials will be used to hold everything together.</p>
      <p>Elliot Wright, BSG's Vice President of Facilities, said that even though 
        the project will cost $6 million, these changes are absolutely necessary. 
        A few years ago, pieces of granite fell from the tower.</p>
      <p>&quot;It would not have taken much to cause disaster,&quot; Wright said. 
        &quot;There was an earthquake here at Bowdoin a few years ago which could 
        have easily taken her down, and possibly at the cost of a few lives.&quot;</p>
      <p>Other students aren't so sure exactly what is happening with the towers.</p>
      <p>&quot;All I know is that they are taking a really long time,&quot; said 
        Kathleen Callaghy '07, who was studying out on the quad near the chapel.</p>
      <p>Joe Adu '07 felt differently. &quot;With all the ancient buildings that 
        they have here, they can take all the time they need to make sure that 
        it stands firm and tall,&quot; he said. &quot;The House of God should 
        be built with perfection.&quot;</p>
      <p>Up on the scaffolding, the crew is treated to a view that few others 
        see on campus. Tuesday, out in the open air next to the top of the North 
        tower, the sun is peeking through the clouds on the horizon behind Boucher. 
        It creates a spectacular landscape, with light radiating over the Walker 
        Art Building and brushing the side of Hubbard Hall. Boucher said that 
        building the two towers is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. He said that 
        the recognition belongs to his crew--those guys who are helping to build 
        part of Bowdoin history.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's not a project you get to do everyday,&quot; Boucher said. 
        &quot;It feels good.&quot;<br>
