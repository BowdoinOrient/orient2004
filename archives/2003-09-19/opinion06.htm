      <p align="left"><font size="5">The work is temporary, but the education will last<br></font>
        <font size="2">KATHERINE HAYES<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> I am writing this as much for myself, as for the first-years, 
        as well as for the seniors, and anyone else who feels like the relentless 
        &quot;to do&quot; list will never be completed. This semester I'm taking 
        organic chemisty. Everyone that I know who has ever taken a college level 
        organic chemistry class either hated it, or loved it, with the former 
        comprising the overwhelming majority. I was hoping to be one of the few 
        lucky ones who loved it. However, a week into the class, I can't say that 
        I'm in love with atomic orbitals, and the work is hardly anything to get 
        excited about. </p>
      <p>Looking for inspiration, my grandfather (having survived organic chemistry 
        here over fifty years ago) advised me, &quot;Yes, it's hard. But you can 
        do it. If you want it badly enough.&quot; And so I think to myself, do 
        I want this? Do I want to be sitting in the library on a Saturday afternoon 
        memorizing structures? Do I want to be in my room at midnight drawing 
        Carbon bonds, before an eight o'clock lab the next morning? When I have 
        read the chapters, taken the tests, passed in the homework, and finally 
        after much hard work and focus, survived the semester, I will realize 
        that I must have wanted it in the first place. This is precisely why I'm 
        making a resolution for the semester: keep things in perspective. And 
        I encourage you all to do the same. Because really, this article has nothing 
        to do with organic chemistry, or science classes in general. All courses, 
        regardless of their department, are challenging and each is accompanied 
        with their own frustrations and hurdles to overcome. But I don't think 
        any student can deny that once you've completed a course, whether you 
        hated it or loved it, you feel a sense of accomplishment. And this sense 
        of accomplishment will surely resonate as you receive your grade report 
        at the end of the semester, your diploma at the end of four years, or 
        your acceptance to graduate school somewhere down the road. So for right 
        now, when the going gets tough, remember that the tough is worth the effort. 
        And you'll be a better person for it, in the end. </p>
      <p>I am writing this as much for myself, as for the first years, as well 
        as for the seniors, and anyone else who feels like the relentless &quot;to 
        do&quot; list will never be completed. I admit feeling a little bit hypocritical 
        writing this because even for me, frustration often overrides the thought 
        of looking back at the moment and feeling like I've completed something. 
        But this is precisely why I am putting it in writing. I am making a promise 
        to myself to keep in mind that not only will there be an end, and a purpose 
        to it all, but there will be fun to be had in the meantime. Classes are 
        important and your education is invaluable, but maintaining your sanity 
        is essential. So as you work hard, remember to breathe and have faith 
        that you're working towards something, not just working. And one day you'll 
        see that it was worth it.</p>
      <p>The sister of a friend who recently graduated as a molecular biology 
        major, shared some of her hindsight with me: &quot;A wise friend of mine 
        and I had this exchange once: 'this too shall pass' ... 'and so shall 
        we.' Don't worry: chemistry misery is temporary. Tragically the grades 
        do stick around, I won't deny it, but science happiness is forever! Good 
        luck.&quot; </p>
      <p>Now I am wishing you all the luck in maintaining this outlook: the work 
        is temporary, but the happiness of an education will last forever. <br>
