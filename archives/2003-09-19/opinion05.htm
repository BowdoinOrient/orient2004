      <p align="left"><font size="5">FCC needs to reprioritize<br></font>
        <font size="2">BEN KREIDER<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> On Tuesday the Senate courageously passed a resolution 
        repealing new rules proposed by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). 
        Much to the chagrin of the White House, a 55-40 vote indicated widespread 
        disapproval of regulations that would result in even further media consolidation. 
        Now it is up to the House and the White House to make the right move by 
        allowing the resolution to become a law.</p>
      <p>The resolution would overturn rules that allow a company to own both 
        a television station and a newspaper in the same market. New regulations 
        would also increase the share of the nationwide market that a network 
        can legally control from 35 to 45 percent.</p>
      <p>A strong bipartisan coalition sent a clear message to FCC Chairman Michael 
        Powell, son of Secretary of State Colin Powell. The congressional backlash 
        was a welcome event for lobbying groups such as the American Civil Liberties 
        Union (ACLU) and MoveOn.org, which have been rallying for months against 
        the FCC.</p>
      <p>Predictably, the immense opposition to deregulation angered Powell. In 
        a July 28 op-ed piece in The New York Times, he pointed out that most 
        top sports programming has already moved to cable and satellite. In addition, 
        cable's market share beat out network TV for the first time in history 
        this year. Powell claims that networks will be able to compete better 
        if they can reach a higher percentage of the market.</p>
      <p>In the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, he said the resolution was &quot;bordering 
        on the absurd.&quot; In a public statement following the vote, Powell 
        said the resolution's results would not be in the public interest. &quot;What 
        is most important is to have the best policies for the American people,&quot; 
        said Powell. &quot;I hope the House will take a more considered view of 
        the public interest.&quot;</p>
      <p>Let's consider his words for a moment. Powell thinks Congress's actions 
        are absurd and against the public interest? He must be quite out of touch 
        with the common man if he believes it will benefit the average citizen 
        for corporate behemoths to further line their pockets.</p>
      <p>In a recent CNN poll, 96 percent of respondents believed there was already 
        too much media consolidation. The FCC recently received over 700,000 public 
        comments regarding the matter, over 99 percent of which oppose the rules. 
        The public has been very clear about its opinion. </p>
      <p>Powell's claims that the rules would help network TV to compete could 
        be true, but they ignore the negative effects of media deregulation. And 
        cable TV is not exactly consumer-friendly. A study by the Center for Public 
        Integrity showed that AOL Time Warner, Viacom, and Disney control 12 out 
        of the top 20 cable networks. Since 1996, cable rates have risen 40 percent. 
      </p>
      <p>Further media consolidation would lead to less competition and diversity 
        in a world already dominated by a handful of media companies. Clear Channel 
        has purchased over 1,400 stations since the Telecommunications Act of 
        1996 eliminated caps on the number of stations a company could own.</p>
      <p>As anyone who regularly listens to radio knows, this leads to stations 
        that almost exclusively play pop put out by major record labels. It is 
        nearly impossible for independent artists, who cannot afford costly middlemen, 
        to get mainstream airplay. </p>
      <p>Greater media consolidation would hinder free speech by leading to less 
        diversity in both opinions and ownership. Marvin Johnson, an ACLU Legislative 
        Counsel, explained: &quot;To have one company providing all of the information 
        in one market diminishes one of the greatest aspects of America - a free 
        and open dialogue among the informed citizenry on the issues at hand.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>During the war in Iraq, many Americans grew frustrated with the overwhelmingly 
        pro-war coverage of U.S. networks. In response, many viewers turned to 
        such outlets as the BBC to obtain more balanced reporting. </p>
      <p>The rules would not only make it harder to hear different viewpoints, 
        but they would also make it difficult for new voices to emerge. An individual 
        such as Ted Turner would find it difficult to start an independent network 
        in this environment.</p>
      <p>The FCC is not acting in the public interest. The White House must not 
        go through with its threatened veto, and the House must follow the example 
        set by the Senate. If they do not, they may allow media monopolies to 
        jeopardize the free exchange of ideas that is the very essence of our 
        democracy. <br>
