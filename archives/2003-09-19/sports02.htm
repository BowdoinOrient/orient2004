      The Bowdoin Women's Soccer Team was very busy and successful last weekend. 
      They began by notching their first NESCAC win of the season with a 2-1 victory 
      over the Wesleyan Cardinals. While not a perennial NESCAC powerhouse, the 
      Cardinals took the Polar Bears by surprise with their intense play and energy 
      early on. Natalie Cohen of Wesleyan netted the first goal ten minutes into 
      the game, firing a rocket shot into an open net. But, the Polar Bears could 
      not be held down for long.

      The momentum began to change toward the end of the half as Bowdoin's ferocious 
      first years began to step up their play. Ivy Blackmore '07 crossed a beautiful 
      ball to Elizabeth Graham '07, who nailed it home for the first Bowdoin goal 
      of the game. Senior forward Jillian Falwell accredited this switch in momentum 
      to the team's level of fitness. &quot;Wesleyan began to lose their fire 
      and we took advantage of their tiredness and tied the game,&quot; said Falwell. 
      &quot;They began to get more physical as they got more tired, so we simply 
      tried to play our game and possess the ball and find a hole to attack.&quot; 
      <p>The Bears did not find the net again until the 76th minute, but they 
        dominated the field throughout the second half. Chrissy Goss '04 sealed 
        the victory for Bowdoin off a beautiful feed from Cedar Goldman '05. </p>
      <p>Senior Captain Rebekah Metzler attributes much of her team's success 
        to the new, young players. &quot;The first years have brought great energy 
        and quickness to our squad. They are confident in their playing styles 
        and completely willing to learn how to play our style of soccer,&quot; 
        said Metzler. &quot;Their great positive attitudes have been the key to 
        our success.&quot; </p>
      <p>Sunday the women's soccer team faced Bridgewater State in their first 
        double header of the year. Back to back games are never easy, especially 
        after just squeaking out a victory the day before. The Polar Bears knew 
        their legs would be tired and in order to take an early lead they had 
        to come out strong. Falwell said, &quot;We came out as a force and although 
        it took us a while to score we completely dominated the whole time&#133;you 
        couldn't tell our legs were tired and sore, which is a huge testament 
        to the heart and passion we have on this team.&quot; </p>
      <p>Falwell started her big day off early with two goals and one assist, 
        scoring a brilliant header off a high-flying cross from Goldman. Graham 
        scored her second goal of the weekend ten minutes later showing once again 
        the first years are here to stay. </p>
      <p>Junior back Kendall Cox feels the strong first year class is crucial 
        to the team's success this year. &quot;As a group they have already made 
        a large contribution on the field,&quot; said Cox. With the new substitution 
        rule (players can only appear once in a half), it is important to have 
        a great deal of depth.&quot;</p>
      <p>As the second half began Falwell continued her explosive play up front. 
        She scored her second goal off a pass from midfielder Julie Barnes '04, 
        that slid through legs of the Bridgewater keeper. Metzler, on the other 
        hand, was a wall in the goal. Her exceptional athleticism was tested but 
        her cat-like prowess stopped a curving cornerkick from landing in the 
        back of the net. Senior Hillary Smith sent Bridgewater packing netting 
        the fourth and final goal of the game. </p>
      <p>The lady bears have a very tough schedule ahead of them and need the 
        support of the students more than ever this weekend. They face one of 
        their biggest rivals, Williams at home on Saturday. Cox said of this weekend's 
        game, &quot;For the last two years we've lost to Williams in the NESCAC 
        semi-finals, once in overtime and once in a shootout.&quot; The lady footballers 
        are psyched for the opportunity to give the Purple Cows a taste of their 
        own medicine. Metzler could not have said it better when she asserted, 
        &quot;Revenge is on the menu!&quot;<br>
