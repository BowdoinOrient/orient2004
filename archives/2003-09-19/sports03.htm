      The Bowdoin Women's Rugby Team started their season off last weekend at 
      the Beantown Rugby Tournament in Amherst, Massachusetts. With over 20 rookies 
      and a strong veteran lineup, the ruggers held high hopes going into the 
      tournament. 
      <p>However, the women went into their first match as a varsity sport a little 
        rusty. Losing to Springfield College 22-5, they found themselves scrimmaging 
        and rucking until senior fullback Lynette Batt scored the only try of 
        the game in the first half with the support of the entire back line. The 
        team also suffered an unfortunate setback during the game when senior 
        Courtney Reilly suffered a concussion. But setbacks didn't bring their 
        hopes down.</p>
      <p>In the second half, many rookies got their first opportunity to play. 
        They had been eagerly anticipating their debut for over two weeks. Coach 
        Mary Beth Matthews said, &quot;Bowdoin was outplayed by a more experienced 
        team, but learned much in the process.&quot; </p>
      <p>By the second match Saturday afternoon, the ruggers were fired up and 
        played a strong game against returning Division II semi-finalists St. 
        Joseph's University. Although Bowdoin lost 7-0, they played with increased 
        integration between the forwards and backs, as well as improved handling, 
        rucking, and support. Angell, Backs, and Batt provided clutch defensive 
        tackles to hold St. Joe's from further scoring, while forwards Whitney 
        Alexander '04, Lauren Flinn '04, Ashley Inderfurth '04, Rachel Hedlund 
        '04, and Jen Horwitz '04 led the Black Pack to a solid game. Narrowly 
        missing several scoring opportunities, the Bears showed a promising performance.</p>
      <p>By Sunday, most players were sore if not exhausted from Saturday's double-header, 
        but they pulled together to beat Norwich University 5-0. Veterans and 
        rookies alike unified and played a great offensive game. In a split 3-10 
        back play, back Shauna Johnston '05 scored a corner try to put Bowdoin 
        ahead. In the second half the rookies played tough defense, led by some 
        of the amazing tackles by fly half Margaret &quot;Munny&quot; Munford 
        '07 and Paige Contreras-Gould '04.</p>
      <p>Under the skillful coaching of Mary Beth and Bob Matthews, Kathryn Buckspan, 
        and former Beantown back Bit, the ladies have shown excellent potential 
        for a winning season. In addition, the leadership of captains Lauren Flinn 
        and Rachel Jones, as well as the returning upperclassmen, has helped to 
        unite the team. First-year Astrid Rodriguez put it best when she said, 
        &quot;I looked into rugby and had the balls to step out onto the pitch. 
        It's still scary, but I know I can do it. Plus, I have forty-plus awesome 
        women telling me I can...just in case I forget.&quot;</p>
      <p>The team is certainly unique in the sense that even though it has been 
        named a varsity sport, it continues to be open to walk-ons who have never 
        played rugby or any sport for that matter. </p>
      <p>The women are enjoying many of the luxuries that came with changing from 
        club to varsity, including more comfortable accommodations and recognition. 
        Claudia Marroquin '06 said, &quot;although we were always athletes at 
        Bowdoin, our hard work, sweat, tears, victories, and pain are now acknowledged 
        on a greater spectrum.&quot; </p>
      <p>Taking the experience from the weekend's tournament, captain Rachel Jones 
        '04 said of the new team, &quot;they have a greater understanding of the 
        game and of the camaraderie that comes with playing rugby.&quot; Captain 
        Lauren Flinn '04 agrees with Jones, &quot;the women's rugby team is a 
        unique group on campus. You cannnot go anywhere else at Bowdoin and find 
        so many different types of people who are willing to put their body on 
        the line for a sport and for each other.&quot; </p>
      <p>The women look forward playing against Colby this Saturday in Waterville.
