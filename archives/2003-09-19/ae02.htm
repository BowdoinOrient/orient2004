      <p align="left"> &quot;I'll tell ya what&#133;the show is being recorded 
        and they told me you gotta do this song, you gotta do that song, you gotta 
        stand like this or act like that&#133;they just don't get it&#133;I'm 
        here to what you want me to do and what I want to do&#133;so what do you

      <p>That was the question that Johnny Cash posed to nearly 1,000 inmates 
        huddled together in the mess hall of San Quentin Prison on February 24, 
        1969. The question was answered with cheers followed by calls for &quot;Walk 
        the Line,&quot; one of Cash's more popular songs. The Man in Black quickly 
        heeded the request, allowing the inmates to escape their dreary routine 
        for a few hours.</p>
      <p>Johnny Cash was not an actor; he was purely a performer. In an age where 
        record labels promote musicians through superficiality, Cash's image was 
        based on honesty. Cash's conviction powered his witty stories of love, 
        adversity and the often extremely painful combination of the two. He was 
        a champion of the genuine heart of America, the type of people that faced 
        a hard day, everyday. Johnny Cash earned their respect through a candidness 
        about his own adversity, and an unmatched sincerity in his voice.</p>
      <p>Cash was born into a depressed America in 1932. A child of farmers in 
        Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash traveled north to work at an auto plant in Pontiac, 
        Michigan and later joined the Air Force. There he began writing a few 
        songs with limited success; however, more importantly, during this time 
        the decision to become a music star was made. Cash worked doggedly to 
        achieve his dream, teaming up with a pair of auto mechanics to play at 
        churches and country fairs. His group, the Tennessee Three, was signed 
        by Sun Records in 1955 and he produced his first hit, &quot;Cry, Cry, 
        Cry.&quot; The album sold nearly 100,000 copies in the South. Cash's dream 
        had come true and for the next twenty years Cash experienced nearly unparalleled 
        success. In the 1950s Cash produced his classic hits &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; 
        &quot;Walk the Line,&quot; and &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; songs 
        of individual struggle with human nature. </p>
      <p>A dependency on prescription drugs caused Cash to fall into his own personal 
        struggle in the 1960s. He became depressed and in 1965 was arrested and 
        pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge. Cash spent one night in jail. 
        His savior was June Carter, who became Cash's great love. June forced 
        Johnny to rediscover himself and to start attending Church services. June 
        and Johnny, country music's first couple, tied the knot in 1968. </p>
      <p>In 1969, Cash quickly rebounded and began hosting a prime time television 
        show, The Johnny Cash Show, where he served as the backdrop to such stars 
        as Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Roy Orbison and Neil Young. 
        Also in 1969, Cash produced his biggest pop hit, &quot;A Boy Named Sue,&quot; 
        a Shel Silverstein song that followed the obvious struggles of a man with 
        an effeminate name.</p>
      <p>During the 1980s and early 1990s The Man in Black lost some of his record-selling 
        success, but continued to be an influential musician, teaming up on individual 
        songs with Ray Charles, Emmylou Harris, U2, and Willie Nelson. In 1994, 
        Rick Rubin, co-founder of rap label Def Jam, wanted to reproduce the magical 
        simplicity of Cash's earlier success and produced four albums with only 
        Cash and a guitar for the American Recordings label. These albums had 
        limited success with the exception of the last. </p>
      <p>Cash produced American IV: The Man Comes Around at age 71. The album 
        overflows with self-reflection, deep loneliness, and power. Earlier this 
        year, Mark Romanek, who directed One Hour Photo, made a stark music video 
        for Cash's cover of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt.&quot; I have 
        never seen so much gravity in a man's face and voice. Using the same unique 
        intensity and openness that has marked his career, Cash's video was nominated 
        for six MTV Video Music Awards and won for cinematography.</p>
      <p>Johnny Cash died last Friday, September 12. He leaves behind him a life 
        of sincerity. The Man in Black's music developed from his inner-self, 
        and was performed entirely for the audience. In that respect, Johnny Cash 
        is unmatched, but hopefully not forgotten.<br>
