        COLUMNIST</font></p>
      <p align="left"> It's not that I want an earthquake to solve this California 
        recall issue - I've got family out there, plus California is the world's 
        fifth largest economy - it's just that things would be so much easier 
        if it did. The only people who really benefit from this debacle are the 
        people of Florida who just look better by comparison. </p>
      <p>First, some history: The recall process itself was designed to fight 
        corruption in the early 20th century. It was part of a number of &quot;progressive&quot; 
        actions taken by the state, including the initiative and referendum. The 
        idea was to make those elected more directly responsive to the will of 
        the people by giving the people the power to recall them if they fell 
        out of favor. </p>
      <p>So far, four officials have been recalled. In 1913, state senator Edwin 
        Grant was recalled for his opposition to prostitution in San Francisco 
        (new San Francisco motto: Infuriatingly Silly Since 1913). That same year 
        another state senator was recalled for a banking scandal. Not until 1995 
        did the next recall succeed, when two GOP members of the state assembly 
        were given the boot for making a deal with the Democrats in regards to 
        party control over the assembly. </p>
      <p>Second, the philosophical problem with the recall: today the issue is 
        not whether Davis committed a crime, which would warrant an impeachment 
        process; the issue is whether Californians were happy with how they voted. 
        The problem with recall is that it subjugates the process of republican 
        government to the whim of the people. Voters had their chance, now they 
        want another. </p>
      <p>Now, the pragmatic problem with the recall: everybody and their smut-peddling 
        uncle can run for election on the cheap. Running in the recall is less 
        expensive than a full blown election, so naturally, it has attracted the 
        crazies. I don't mean to be judgmental - wait, yes I do - but this whole 
        thing looks like a casting call for the Jerry Springer Show. And it's 
        not that porn-mogul Larry Flint shouldn't be allowed to run for Governor, 
        it's just that he should have to mud-wrestle Garry Coleman first. Next 
        on Fox! A wheelchair bound smut-peddler wrestles a midget former child 
        star! Right after the new reality TV Show - 'Syphilis Island'! That should 
        attract the 18-35 year old male viewers. </p>
      <p>At a time when we're trying to instill a sense of democratic virtues 
        in other parts of the world, maybe we shouldn't be turning the governance 
        of the world's fifth largest economy into a farce. </p>
      <p>Now, I'm being a bit sarcastic here, I know. This is probably just a 
        defense mechanism to keep me from addressing my increasing distrust of 
        people in general and Californians specifically, but there are some serious 
        issues with the other candidates as well. Arnold Schwartzenegger, for 
        example has yet to prove to Republicans that he is in fact, well, a Republican. 
        Pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, and the irony of all ironies, pro-gun 
        control leaves him socially more liberal than Howard Dean. Fiscal conservatism 
        might be Arnold's only real conservative strength. </p>
      <p>All this is fine - in fact, it might be the best the GOP can hope for 
        in California, but when Warren Buffet, as Arnold's money-man talked about 
        upping property taxes, what's left? Schwartzenegger publicly rejected 
        Buffet's assertion that he should raise taxes and promised that if the 
        financial guru ever said anything like that again he would have to do 
        500 sit-ups. Regardless, most conservatives are of mixed minds about Schwartzenegger. 
      </p>
      <p>Tom McClintock seems to be the real conservative in the race, leaving 
        those who want to see a conservative revival in California the same choice 
        liberals had in choosing between Nader and Gore back in 2000 - one has 
        the votes to win, but the other stands closer to their values. </p>
      <p>Davis' Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante is leading the Democrat's ticket, 
        and most polls show him a few points up on Schwartzenegger. Whether he 
        amounts to anything more than Davis Lite has yet to be seen. Davis himself, 
        going out with all the flair of a bottle rocket, in an attack on Schwartzenegger's 
        accent suggested that only people who could properly pronounce &quot;California&quot; 
        should be Governor. On a side note, can you imagine the outrage if a Republican, 
        say Bush, had said something like that about a Mexican-American's accent? 
      </p>
      <p>Now the 9th Circuit Court (of &quot;under God&quot; fame) has ruled that 
        the election cannot take place on October 7th, because the ballot system 
        is the same as the one used in Florida, with an error rate of about 2.5%. 
        Never mind that this is the same system used to elect and then re-elect 
        Davis in 2002, two years after Bush v. Gore. Equally unconcerned is the 
        court with the fact that other systems being used in different districts 
        are even less accurate. Although I am fully against the recall on principle, 
        I am a little disturbed that the courts would call off a vote in advance, 
        to cancel an election before it took place. This seems to be a dangerous 
        precedent. </p>
      <p>Ultimately though, this is a triumph for federalism. It is a triumph 
        because no matter how ridiculous the candidates, the rulings, the law, 
        the results in California, they are limited to California. For this we 
        can be grateful; when each state is responsible for itself the tumors 
        are limited to the border and cannot spread to the rest of the country.
