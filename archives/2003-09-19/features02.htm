      <p align="left">Choosing to start his summer with a challenge, Christopher 
        Houston Blodgett '06 spent his first month away from Bowdoin on a 2,200 
        mile bike ride down the East Coast. Blodgett completed the ride in order 
        to raise money for Operation Smiles, a nonprofit organization that provides 
        reconstructive facial surgery for underprivileged children from around 
        the world.</p>

      Blodgett and his companion, 27-year-old Tyler Jordan of Virginia, averaged 
      between 80 and 110 miles per day. The pair raised around $50,000 dollars, 
      enough to provide surgery for 66 children from various countries.
<p>The trip began on May 20 at Cadillac Mountain in Bar Harbor, Maine, the 
        spot where the sun first hits the east coast of the United States. It 
        ended 25 days later, June 23, at South Beach in Miami, Florida, with some 
        scheduled rest days in between. &quot;New England was the worst part by 
        far since it rained the entire time,&quot; Blodgett recalled. &quot;It 
        was cold, and I was spending eight hours a day in spandex in the pouring 
        rain.&quot; He did pass through campus on his third day. &quot;It was 
        miserable weather and campus was deserted, but it was still a welcome 
        sight.&quot;</p>
      <p>The ride presented a variety of obstacles including falls, detours, and 
        vehicles on the roads. &quot;The first time I wiped out was in Massachusetts,&quot; 
        Blodgett explained. &quot;I hit a pothole, popped my front tire, lost 
        control of the bike, and went off the shoulder. The bike flipped over, 
        and I got a huge bruise on my thigh from the handlebars.&quot; He also 
        received a traffic ticket for biking on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a limited 
        access road. &quot;I snuck around the tollbooths, but someone saw me and 
        called the cops,&quot; Blodgett said.</p>
      <p>Blodgett continued, &quot;The whole trip was incredible. I would definitely 
        do it again. Maybe not the exact same route, but I would like to do another 
        trip.&quot; He recalls biking around the Marine Corps Base Quantico in 
        Virginia, as one of the most interesting points in the trip. &quot;I must 
        admit I was a little awed, sitting there on my 20-pound bike and watching 
        the heavily armed soldiers pass by.&quot;</p>
      <p>Blodgett and Jordan's route took them around most major cities; however, 
        they still had some cars come too close for comfort. &quot;We had a lot 
        of close calls with logging trucks,&quot; Blodgett remembers. &quot;Of 
        all the vehicles on the road, logging trucks are by far the worst.&quot; 
        They biked around New York City, which is notorious for its drivers and 
        ran into the worst traffic at the end of the trip. &quot;Florida drivers 
        are horrible,&quot; Blodgett recalled.</p>
      <p>Blodgett began work with Operation Smile two years ago doing volunteer 
        work. Two summers ago, he helped to organize a student conference sponsored 
        by the organization. He planned to go on a mission to China in fall 2001, 
        but it fell through because the group was scheduled to depart shortly 
        after September 11. Disappointed at the trip's cancellation, he decided 
        that he &quot;wanted to do something significant. [Organizing this ride] 
        was my way of contributing to this cause.&quot; Operation Smile has chapters 
        in 19 different countries and employs trained surgeons from across the 
        globe to operate on children from those locations.<br>
