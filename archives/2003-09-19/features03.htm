        ORIENT STAFF</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Lindsay,</p>
      <p>I am a first year here, and I don't know how I got matched up with my 
        roommates. Our interests are all completely different. They're nice enough 
        guys, but it seems like we have nothing in common. The guys across the 
        hall all play fall sports, so I can see why they live together. Why wasn't 
        I put with people who are more like me?</p>
      <p> -Mismatched Male</p>
      <p>Dear Mismatched,</p>
      <p>Over the summer, Bob Graves and his hard-working staff try their best 
        to put &quot;Incoming First Year #134 Who Likes Folk Music and Foreign 
        Films&quot; with &quot;French-speaking, Folk-dancing Incoming First Year 
        #91.&quot; However, trouble arises when, at the end of the day, there 
        just aren't any more polka-dancing incoming first years to complete the 
        room trio. As much as Residential Life would like every incoming first 
        year to be happy with his/her living situation, it just isn't going to 
        happen. Since a space cannot sit empty, Residential Life has to do a little 
        improvising. Suddenly, &quot;Incoming First Year #225 Who Enjoys Snowboarding 
        and 'Just chillin'&quot; is the perfect third roommate they've been looking 
        for. After all, 134+91=225. </p>
      <p>Some room groups are just plain random. As much as I dislike being the 
        bearer of bad news, it sounds as if your room is one of these hodge-podges. 
        As unfortunate as this is for you, it's nothing personal. It's just bad 
        luck. Now, here's the good news. Your situation could be much worse. You 
        could have a roommate who perpetually smells of curry, bites his toenails 
        while watching the WB Friday night lineup, or owns and operates an Egg 
        Wave (a plastic contraption that allows one to cook eggs in a microwave) 
        in your common room. Random is starting to look pretty good, huh? </p>
      <p>Now, you write that your roommates are &quot;nice enough guys.&quot; 
        This is big. Huge actually. &quot;Nice enough&quot; = &quot;Good enough 
        to live with.&quot; Keep in mind that your first-year roommates need not 
        be your two new best friends. However, since the three of you are crammed 
        into a two-room triple that feels like the size of a shoebox, it would 
        probably be in your best interest to try to get along - especially since 
        you have to sleep in the same room with them. So, play nice or else you'll 
        be sleeping with one eye open. </p>
      <p>You could even go one step further than coexisting with your roommates 
        and make an attempt to get to know them. They were accepted to Bowdoin 
        for some reason, so unless their last names are Druckenmiller and Ladd, 
        they probably have something to bring to the table (although I'm sure 
        little Stanley and Sammy Jr. would be wonderful additions to the Bowdoin 
        community). Find out what your roommates have to offer; you may even learn 
        something useful.</p>
      <p>It's like fruit Mentos. Okay, bad example. No one eats fruit Mentos. 
        It's like Skittles. The last time I had the joy of tasting the rainbow, 
        there were five different taste sensations going on in my mouth. Sure 
        I didn't enjoy the yellow ones as much as the red ones, but the point 
        is that I still ate the yellow ones. So, unless your rainbow is only one 
        color (in which case it wouldn't be a rainbow), I'm sure that you have 
        it in you to expand your horizons.</p>
      <p>Res. Life has a tough job, but their rate of success has been good so 
        far. No one's &quot;eliminated&quot; his/her first-year roommate yet. 
        And just imagine the fun they must have with some of this. I mean, it 
        must have felt like Christmas (or Hanukkah) came early to the first floor 
        of Moulton Union when they got to put &quot;Corona&quot; and &quot;Brandy&quot; 
        in the same room freshman year. And two guys named &quot;Ray&quot; under 
        the age of 45 in Moore 014&#133;. Coincidence? I think not.<br>
