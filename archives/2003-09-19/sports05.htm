      Of the three games Bowdoin has played thus far, all have ended in a 2-1 
      victory, with two of the contests going into overtime. Last Saturday, in 
      their NESCAC opener, the Polar Bears defeated Wesleyan from behind with 
      goals by Bresnehan and Bobby Desilets '05. Minutes before the end of the 
      half, Bresnehan settled a Desilets pass and rifled a left-footed laser just 
      under the post. 
      <p>For the next 40 minutes, Derr wrote the story. While Wesleyan managed 
        to tie the game at 1-1 five minutes into the second half, Derr's strong 
        play enabled Bowdoin to stay in the game. If not for a save at point-blank 
        range just minutes later, the Polar Bears would have trailed for the first 
        time this season. </p>
      <p>While the athleticism required to make the sprawling save was what stood 
        out to fans, Derr credited his strong play this season to confidence and 
        teammates' trust in him. He has emerged as a vocal leader with key members 
        of the defense, Danny Sullivan '05 and Mike Crowley '05, out with injuries.</p>
      <p>&quot;The biggest change this year is that I am forced to be more vocal 
        without Sullivan there,&quot; said Derr. &quot;Having that voice or leadership 
        role makes you more confident, and knowing that your teammates are confident 
        in you is what makes those saves.&quot; </p>
      <p>Confidence has been important in the close contests that have characterized 
        the season thus far. This isn't to say that Derr is completely content 
        with making key saves in close games. &quot;We need to win games 2-0 or 
        3-0 and not put ourselves in situations where one missed tackle or one 
        bad call costs us a win,&quot; said Derr. </p>
      <p>The close games can be partially attributed to opposing teams being able 
        to shut down Bowdoin's two top scorers from a year ago. Last year's leading 
        scorer, Andrew Russo '06, has been held scoreless thus far this season 
        despite leading the team with 14 shots on goal. However, Russo's two assists 
        ties him with the team leader Desilets, who scored his first goal of the 
        year after coming off the bench, the game-winner against Wesleyan.</p>
      <p>When two players who combined for nineteen goals last season have been 
        held virtually scoreless, opposing teams must be scared wondering if they 
        will be the opponent when the duo's scoring prowess explodes back on the 
        scene. This can only bode well for the Polar Bears.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tucker Hodgkins '05 and Bresnehan have picked up the slack, 
        combining for five goals and each tallying a game-winner in overtime, 
        with Bresnehan scoring four minutes into the extra period Tuesday night 
        at previously unbeaten Plymouth State. While in previous seasons Bresnehan 
        has been more of a physical midfield presence and asset on corner kicks, 
        this season he has attacked the goals with the same zeal he uses when 
        turning Moulton Union into his personal battlefield on chicken parm night. 
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the emergence of Bresnehan as a goal scorer and the return 
        of Hodgkins, the team has benefited from strong play from Bucky Jencks 
        '05 and John Hollis '07 in the backfield. Also, Ethan Roth '04 has been 
        vital to the team with his quickness and ball control in the midfield. 
        Still, the story thus far has been the team's ability to pull out close 
        games. The biggest test thus far will come this Saturday at noon when 
        Williams College visits to play a game featuring two of the top teams 
        in the nation. <br>
