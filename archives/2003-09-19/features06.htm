        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">On June 27, 1860 the expedition left Thomaston for the open 
        sea. Life in the United States was fast paced, constantly moving, and 
        constantly changing. At sea, they left that life behind for an ocean whose 
        enduring beauty and power never fades.</p>
      <p>The United States of America that the boys left behind was a very different 
        place than it is today. Tensions were mounting in the debate over slavery-- 
        the debate that would in the next year erupt into a bloody civil war. 
      </p>
      <p>In an article titled &quot;Pro-Slavery Tyranny,&quot; the Franklin Repository, 
        a weekly newspaper from Pennsylvania, explained why the slave states were 
        so devoid of Republicans. The culture of fear was so widespread and strong 
        that &quot;no one can be an active Republican and stay there, save a few 
        localities along the border, unless he takes his life in his hand and 
        holds it at the mouth of a pistol.&quot; </p>
      <p>The title referred to the tyrannical practice of control that pro-slavery 
        forces had on the press. The article explains that &quot;hundreds who 
        have subscribed and paid for the Tribune [a northern newspaper] are not 
        allowed to receive it; thousands who would gladly take and pay for it 
        are deterred from doing so by terror.&quot; The country, spiraling downward 
        in turmoil, was near its breaking point, but the further the Nautilus 
        sailed from port, the more peaceful the country looked.</p>
      <p>The state of Maine was also vastly different in 1860. Agriculture was 
        a main concern-as reported in the Richmond (Maine) Sun, &quot;There will 
        be two-thirds as much hay this year as there was last,&quot; but because 
        of the favorable weather, the hay will be worth more than last year, so 
        &quot;taking into account the promising crop of corn, apples, etc., we 
        shall not be so very poorly provided for, after all.&quot; Other than 
        the crops, the most exciting breaking stories in small-town Maine were 
        mere trivialities. For example, a blurb entitled &quot;Cold&quot; reported 
        that &quot;on Tuesday, the 24th, it was cold enough for fires, and overcoats 
        were not uncomfortable in the daytime. Such a climate as we enjoy.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Another newsworthy story featured a man who frequented the Brunswick 
        Telegraph office to check the time on the Mason Street Church's clock. 
        He purportedly &quot;desires to have the clock, building and all, removed 
        so far west into the street, that he can gain a look at the same, from 
        his own window.&quot;</p>
      <p>Bowdoin College in 1860 also differed from the college that we know today. 
        With President Leonard Woods at the helm, the College steered its undergraduates 
        through a rigorous program where they could take Ancient Languages and 
        Classical Literature from Professor Alpheus Spring Packard Sr., Chemistry 
        and Natural History from Professor Paul A. Chadbourne, and Rhetoric and 
        Oratory from Professor Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Bowdoin students had 
        the opportunity to be involved in, among other things, fraternities, the 
        Literary Athenian and Peucinian Societies, the Praying Circle, the Temperance 
        Society, the Bowdoin Boat Club, the Olympic Cricket Club, the King Chapel 
        Choir, the College Glee Club, or the Republican Campaign Club. A group 
        of students including Professor Packard's son, Alpheus Spring Packard 
        Jr., had recently formed the Cleaveland Society of Natural History in 
        honor of the venerated professor Parker Cleaveland, who launched Bowdoin's 
        science program. The Society noted in the June 1860 Bowdoin Bugle, &quot;We 
        expect great things - and small, from our delegate to the Greenland Expedition 
        set on foot by the Williams Natural History Society.&quot;</p>
      <p>Although today ships have more modern equipment, a sailor embarking on 
        an ocean voyage still sees the same view as his predecessors from the 
        Nautilus-- the same view as their predecessors, the pilgrims on the Mayflower, 
        or John Cabot on the Matthew, or Columbus on the Santa Maria. From serene 
        doldrums, to brisk breezes over white-capped waves, to fierce and menacing 
        stormy swells, being out on the Atlantic is timeless. Into this world 
        seemingly bereft of human intervention, these three Bowdoin men set out 
        to learn all they could about the natural world that lay beyond the boundaries 
        seen by most men.<br>
