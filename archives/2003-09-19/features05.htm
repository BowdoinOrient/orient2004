      Some of the most interesting people in the world are the ones that can add 
      that little twist, a bit of special nuance, to our lives. Bowdoin Music 
      Professor Vineet Shende's friend Brian is one of those people. 
      <p>Brian will often call up Shende, a composer, pretending to be the manager 
        of some far-off opera company or orchestra and offering him a major commission 
        for a new piece. So when a man with a heavy German accent called up in 
        February of 2002 and said that the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) was 
        interested in commissioning him, he was a bit skeptical. </p>
      <p>&quot;It soon became apparent, though, that this guy knew far more about 
        the NSO than Brian would have,&quot; Shende remembers with a hearty laugh. 
        It turned out that the heavily-accented voice on the line was indeed with 
        the NSO, and by the end of the conversation, Shende had scored his biggest 
        success so far as a young composer.</p>
      <p>Having recently won the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers 
        (ASCAP) Young Composers Award for his piece &quot;Snarl,&quot; Shende's 
        music caught the ear of renowned conductor and NSO director Leonard Slatkin, 
        who asked him to compose a short piece for the orchestra's final season 
        concert this past June.</p>
      <p>Shende's piece, titled &quot;Razzle,&quot; was to follow two works by 
        giants of the twentieth-century classical music world: Prokofiev and Bartok. 
        While &quot;Razzle&quot; was commissioned as a lighter &quot;encore&quot; 
        to these works, Shende still sought to do what every young artist wants 
        to do-&quot;say something.&quot;</p>
      <p>He drew his inspiration from national and world events at the time-specifically 
        what he called a tendency of the Bush administration and, to an extent, 
        American society as a whole, to paint issues in &quot;big brushstrokes 
        and ignore or deny problematic points.&quot; This lack of nuance is apparent 
        from the start of the piece, which opens with a big, brash, in-your-face 
        fanfare. The climax of the piece features a tortured quote from Shostakovich 
        which is transformed into a more palatable Gershwin tune. The multi-faceted 
        nuance of the Shostakovich tune is ultimately trampled by the fanfare's 
        untimely return. </p>
      <p>The piece was met with wild applause at its first performance, and received 
        a very favorable review in the Washington Post. This pleased Shende, as 
        he aspires to make his music accessible to a broad audience. While he 
        says that music should &quot;mean something on many levels,&quot; he still 
        feels a need to grab the audience-possibly a product of his early fascination 
        with the visceral energy of rock music.</p>
      <p>Shende came to classical music not in spite of his love of rock and roll, 
        but because of it. After hearing a concert by one of his favorite groups, 
        &quot;Yes,&quot; a teenage Shende investigated Stravinsky's &quot;Firebird 
        Suite,&quot; the finale of the opening number of the band's set. On the 
        other side of the record was Stravinsky's ground-breaking &quot;Rite of 
        Spring,&quot; a ballet depicting pagan ritual using the instruments of 
        the orchestra and manipulating the basic foundations of Western music 
        in a way that changed the course of 20th century music. Shende was hooked. 
        &quot;Stravinsky rocked out harder than anyone else,&quot; he remembers 
        with a smile.</p>
      <p>While the encounter with Stravinsky had opened Shende's eyes to a completely 
        new genre, he wasn't about to devote his life to classical music just 
        yet. He entered Grinnell College-&quot;surrounded by cornfields an hour 
        from the metropolis of Des Moines&quot;-planning to major in physics. 
      </p>
      <p>But those pesky 20th century composers had other plans. After singing 
        some Benjamin Britten in the choir and analyzing some Mahler in theory 
        class, Shende switched to music and never looked back. He earned his Master's 
        from Butler University and his Doctor of Musical Arts from Cornell. A 
        grant from the Mellon Foundation took him back to Grinnell to teach and 
        compose for two years, after which he came to Bowdoin.</p>
      <p>The liberal arts environment appeals to Shende. Having students with 
        such diverse majors as math, history, and chemistry allows for varying 
        and cross-pollinating interpretations of music. Personally, though, Shende 
        sees himself in a position of &quot;huge responsibility, realizing that 
        in many cases the first contact that students will have with these important 
        and beautiful pieces that we study will be through me.&quot;</p>
      <p>Success for him is when his students have made a personal investment 
        in the music they're examining or playing. His classes, like his music, 
        are built out of material that, when properly understood, jumps out and 
        grabs the student. One may find him teaching complex composition techniques 
        using the theme from The Simpsons or having half his class sing &quot;My 
        Country 'Tis of Thee&quot; while the other half sings &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; 
        to illustrate polymeter. </p>
      <p>&quot;There are things that really move me about music,&quot; he says, 
        &quot;and if I can convey them to the students and see in their eyes that 
        they too are experiencing a personal resonance with the material, then 
        I've accomplished my mission.&quot; It's not an easy mission, and one 
        that demands more than a little nuance.<br>
