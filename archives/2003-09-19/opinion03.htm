        <font size="2">MORGAN CONNELLY<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Marijuana, weed, grass, chiba, pot, dope, chrons, nug, 
        herb, ghanja, mary-jane, reefer; call it what you will, it's a hot topic 
        in today's political and social climate. While some countries, namely 
        the Netherlands, have extremely liberal policies regarding the drug, while 
        others have recently taken steps towards decriminalization. The United 
        Kingdom and Switzerland have adopted policies of tolerance concerning 
        the drug, and while it may not be &quot;legalized&quot; yet, law-enforcement 
        agents do not seriously prosecute those who choose to use the drugs in 
        personal amounts.</p>
      <p>Paradoxically, the country we Bowdoin students call home has very stringent 
        policies relating to marijuana. While the United States may be far from 
        legalizing or even decriminalization marijuana, there is a strong case 
        in this country for the government to enact such measures. By comparison, 
        my native country of Canada has &quot;seen the light,&quot; [or at least 
        is in the process of] and is taking steps towards decriminalization. Why? 
      </p>
      <p>Well, for one, there has been strong lobbying from various marijuana 
        activist groups that has put pressure on the Canadian government to loosen 
        its laws in regards to the drug. But the question remains why should marijuana, 
        a supposed &quot;harmful&quot; drug, be legalized? </p>
      <p>First, as mentioned briefly above, we can look to the Netherlands exemplary 
        model as a sign of encouragement. Over the summer, one of my best friends 
        and I traveled around Europe and during the course of our journey, we 
        inevitably made a visit to the lovely city of Amsterdam. I have never 
        been to such an interesting, tolerant, and egalitarian place. Contrary 
        to the pervasive, conservative belief that the drug situation there is 
        out of control, by no means does it dominate societal behavior. Sure, 
        people smoke weed, but it is not shoved in your face, and it has not led 
        to a rampant increase in other drug use. </p>
      <p>While marijuana is widely perceived as a gateway drug, &quot;hard&quot; 
        drugs (generally characterized as any drug more harmful on the human body 
        than marijuana like cocaine, heroin, pcp, crystal meth&#133;) are less 
        prevalent in the Netherlands than in the United States. For example, in 
        1999 the estimated dollar worth of shipments of cocaine into the United 
        States was eight times that of Holland (Federal Drug Administration / 
        Dutch Drug Statistics). Albeit, the United States has a much larger population 
        than the Netherlands, but per capita use of the drug in the United States 
        still outweighs use in Holland. </p>
      <p>Secondly, if the United States were to legalize marijuana, the sale of 
        the drug would be federally regulated and the income generated could be 
        a large source of revenue for the government. Moreover, this would lead 
        to a monumental decrease in street dealing. As a result, marijuana consumed 
        by those who choose to use it would be reliable and safer. </p>
      <p>In addition, marijuana is one of the few currently illegal narcotics 
        not to be linked to any sort of harmful disease. While many speculate 
        that there are permanent and harmful effects of marijuana, research tests 
        have yet to link it to cancer or other definitive terminal illnesses. 
        It is impossible to overdose on naturally-grown marijuana, and it has 
        never caused death due to over-use. </p>
      <p>Again, while many dispute its effect on driving and motor skills, Life 
        magazine published results of a study done to show the relationship between 
        drug use and driving (May 1969, Vol. 16, pp. 51-54). While alcohol was 
        found to have direct effects on driving ability, the marijuana group of 
        participants produced almost the exact same results as the control group. 
      </p>
      <p>To end, I would like to pose a question: does it make sense to you that 
        the United States government spends more money every year on incriminating 
        marijuana users than it does on all other drug users combined? </p>
      <p>Would you not rather have your tax dollars be spent on more, dare I say, 
        useful causes, like education or health care? Does it make sense that 
        Mark Douglas, a forty-four year old man with a wife and two kids, is currently 
        serving fifty years in a Texas state prison for possessing two grams of 
        marijuana in 1991 (my friend and I were made aware of this sad fact while 
        visiting the government-affiliated Marijuana and Hemp Museum in Amsterdam)? 
      </p>
      <p>I admit that marijuana is by no means good for you; it produces tar build-up 
        in your body and long-term use certainly causes memory loss and general 
        indolence. However, it is not nearly as harmful as some already legal 
        drugs (alcohol and cigarettes). Perhaps we Americans could learn a lesson 
        from our northern neighbours.<br>
