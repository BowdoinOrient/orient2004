      <p align="left"><font size="5">Big plays and bigger playmakers slated for Super Bowl XXXVIII</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">NICK LAROCQUE<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">It really is true what they say; there are no great teams in the NFL anymore.  There are great defenses, great offensive lines, great backs, and great receivers, but no great teams.  Today's NFL is characterized by parity.  The structure of the league is designed to ensure that there will never be a team who is unmistakably better than the next. It is this parity that makes the NFL the most exciting organization in professional sports.  Each week and each season is completely unpredictable.  This season has been no exception.  </p>
<p align="left">The past 13 weeks have left me dumbfounded as I have watched the most unlikely of scenarios unfold.  And even now, after these 13 weeks, it is still nearly impossible to predict how things are going to play out.  If you had asked me heading into week one which teams would be doing battle in the conference championship games, I would have told you with confidence that the NFC game would be the Buccaneers and Giants and that the AFC game would be the Steelers and the Bills.</p>
<p align="left">For football fans like myself, there is no time of year more exciting than that which is upon us.  Over the next nine weeks, this whole mess will work itself out bit by bit until February 1, when one team will stand victorious in Houston.  </p>
<p align="left">Week 14's crucial division matchups will clear up many questions about the playoff pictures.  The Patriots will host the Dolphins on Sunday in a matchup with serious implications, as the rivals are separated by only two games in the AFC East.  The surprising Cincinnati Bengals will travel to Baltimore to battle the Ravens for the top spot in the AFC North.  Both teams are 7-5.  Another first place tie will be broken in the AFC South as the Colts and the Titans, two 9-3 teams coming off tough losses, will square off in Nashville.  Finally, Philadelphia will try to hang on to its one game lead in the NFC East, as it hosts Bill Parcells and the second place Cowboys.  All of these games will be the first step in solving not only the question about division championships, but also carry huge playoff implications.  </p>
<p align="left">While it is difficult to make accurate predictions about the post-season before this weekend's games take place, I feel the need to give my official Super Bowl prediction, this being the final issue of the semester.  </p>
<p align="left">What I think will happen: </p>
<p align="left">St. Louis over Indianapolis </p>
<p align="left">Based on what I have seen this year, I have to pick these two teams.  After a slow start, the Rams are heating up at the perfect time.  Torry Holt, the NFL leader in receiving yards, has been an absolute star this year.  He has made big catches for them all year.  Marshall Faulk, arguably the most explosive offensive weapon in the league, is back and ready to carry a heavy workload for the Rams.  Faulk had over 100 yards rushing and three touchdowns in the Rams 48-17 shellacking of the Vikings.  Their defense is one of the most underrated in the league, and when their offense is healthy and in-sync, they truly are the greatest show on turf.  </p>
<p align="left">On offense, the Colts are equally dangerous.  Peyton Manning leads the NFL in passing yards and is one of the smartest quarterbacks in the league.  Edgerrin James provides the Colts with a solid ground attack, while Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne provide a deep threat.  Marcus Pollard, one of the top-tier tight ends in football, provides Manning with another receiving option.  The Colts defense features several standout players.  The most notable is Dwight Freeney, the standout defensive end from Syracuse.  </p>
<p align="left">While Tony Dungy has them playing excellent team defense, I don't think the Colts's defense can ground Marc Bulger and the Rams passing attack. The Rams's will win by ten and fans all over St. Louis will be celebrating their second Super Bowl championship in five seasons. Kurt Warner will probably thank God, and football fans across America will thank God that they can watch Angie Harmon celebrate the win instead of Brenda Warner.</p>
<p align="left">Game I'd like to see:</p>
<p align="left">Ravens over Panthers </p>
<p align="left">There, I said it.  I don't like watching little girl football, and I hate teams that don't run the ball.  So here's what I'd like to see.  After defeating the Bengals this weekend, Ray Lewis and the Ravens go on to dominate for the rest of the season, and make it all the way to the Super Bowl, which is one very unlike what we have seen in the past few years: low scoring and run heavy.  Despite superb performances by both defenses, both Jamal Lewis and Stephen Davis hit the 100-yard marks for the night.  In the end, Anthony Wright outdoes Jake Delhomme in what proves to be the most mediocre quarterback matchup in Super Bowl history.  Ray Lewis is the game's MVP for his outstanding effort in which he makes over 12 solo tackles, a forced fumble, and three pass deflections.  The score: 10-7.  </p>
<p align="left">In a perfect world, the game would be held in Giants Stadium so that the two teams can do battle in the freezing cold over Jimmy Hoffa's grave, the perfect setting for the perfect game.  That's what I'd like to see.  But hey, I'm a Giants fan, so I'm pretty used to disappointment by now.</p>
