      <p align="left"><font size="5">Califone's brave new country</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">SEAN TURLEY<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">When thinking back recently to the cold autumn night when Wilco and Califone graced the State Theatre stage, I was not quite able to decide what exactly left me so amazed. At first, I thought it might have been a girl's outright bizarre gyrations to Jeff Tweedy's lonesome voice. I'll be perfectly honest: we were all a little weirded out. The girl, as if perpetually out of rhythm, theme, and time with what was going on in front of her, twisted and swayed like an overdosing music maniac demanding to be seen by the band that lifted her to such a performance. Luckily, this memory quickly passed.</p>
<p align="left">What bubbled up in its place was the serene beauty of Califone, the openers for Wilco's East Coast jaunt. Sitting rather calmly instead of standing or looking anything rock-like, the band seemed to embody the consummate Midwest musicians, meaning there was a hayseed in each member's mouth, a "Dekalb Corn" hat on each head, and plenty of odd acoustic instruments scattered at their feet.</p>
<p align="left">My companions and I didn't know at the time that the band hailed from the same Chicagoan bastion where left-field musical Americana meets 21st century technology as Wilco. Over time though, the similarities became quite obvious: present were the odd rhythmic gizmos ubiquitous on Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and the soft lyrical touch of Summerteeth.</p>
<p align="left">But where Wilco rawked away, flailing their guitars and channeling intimacy and verit‚ through pounding noise and shimmering computer blips, Califone simply mediated. Focused, professional, and very very serious, Califone played without a single smile, but with a set of utterly elegant force. It was so soft and delicate yet full of harsh, worried undertones that Tim Rutili, the lead singer, seemed subconsciously driven to chant away his bothers to the audience. </p>
<p align="left">Now you may be thinking that this sounds like it would be dreadfully boring live-and it was. But it was fairly clear that the band's sound would translate quite well onto vinyl. So, right as Wilco said their goodbyes, I picked up Califone's first LP, Roomsound, from the theater vendor.</p>
<p align="left">Arriving home and still half deaf, I threw it in, hoping to evoke the spirit that was always so near but never realized at the show. I dreamed it would whisk me away to some imagined Midwest utopia where everyone still banjos on the porch and Rutili documents the muted comings and goings of a lost age. </p>
<p align="left">Their sparse arrangements, programmed drumming, unsettling rhythms, and occasional guitar shouts did take me to this timeless place-but only for a moment. Eventually, instead of satisfaction, I felt disappointment. Roomsound was great, but it certainly didn't capture that same feeling that the music promised. It was great in its potential, not its delivery. Upset, I put the album in a random corner and let Califone slip away.</p>
<p align="left">That was until this summer, when on a regular pilgrimage to Chicago, I was fortunate enough to discover the band's latest release, Quicksand/Cradlesnakes. Right at minute one, I awoke in that land (excuse the hyperbole). Actually, I just kinda danced around a bit and marveled at what I had discovered. </p>
<p align="left">Quicksand excelled everywhere Roomsound had dragged. First off, this album seemed more focused. The arrangements were augmented rather than bogged down by the computer blips. Roomsound sounded like a band playing Math Blaster over a 1940s roots album; Quicksand melded the conflicting noises together. It was peaceful, it was gorgeous, it was expansive-it was totally unique.  </p>
<p align="left">The second distinction is evident in the album's variety. From the jittery opening to "Horoscope. Amputation.Honey" to the distorted freak-out on "Vampiring Again," Quicksand holds a constant, unnerving yet elegant mood without settling into a repetitious rut. Whereas Roomsound felt like Califone on mid-tempo autopilot, Quicksand ups the volume to rock. </p>
<p align="left">On "Simple Twin," the basic acoustic solo that forms the song's centerpiece gives way to a blistery piano and electric guitar explosion reminiscent of an Americana version of Sonic Youth. Over the accelerating sound, Rutili chants some unintelligible bit about which twin is slower (note: debating nature versus nurture over waves of distortion is always a plus) or something equally perfect for the moment.</p>
<p align="left">Califone's Quicksand/Cradlesnakes is even more amazing in that it doesn't stand alone. The back to basics sound of the Strokes or White Stripes may dominate now, but  it is only obstructing the real revolution from view. Califones work along with other bands' unique fusions of today and yesterday's music, which manifests itself on the pop brilliance of the Postal Service's Give Up or the Shins' Oh, Inverted World. </p>
<p align="left">These are the real visionaries, the genuine vanguard. Brilliantly mired in the past, the headlining indie, punk-funk-disco-rock messiahs (looking in the direction of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or TV on the Radio) are a joy indeed for today, but it's Califone's clever dream that's really worth cherishing.</p>
