      <p align="left"><font size="5">Bowdoin bands battle Halloween night away</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">LESLIE BRIDGERS<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">Last Saturday, amidst Bowdoin's Halloween celebration, costumed pub-crawlers and music fans alike wandered in and out of Smith Union bopping their heads and, in some cases, wagging their tails, to an eclectic sampling of songs from bands ranging from heavy metal to ska. While sounds ranged from those of earplug-worthy screams to hypnotizing synthesizers, the variety of music, joined together by the inter-set spinnings of DJ Marquee, made for a memorable installment of Bowdoin's annual Battle of the Bands.</p>
<p align="left">The night began with metal bands In Loving Memory, from Brunswick, and Spiralbound, from the University of Maine at Orono. Though the musicians were not unskilled, the piercing vocals of both bands took away from whatever instrumental prowess they might have possessed. The bands both played original tunes that a different audience may have appreciated, but the few who lent an ear while playing pool upstairs or grabbing snacks at the C-Store were quick to take it back.</p>
<p align="left">Bowdoin's own Reckoner followed with their debut performance. Though it was clear this experimental band was young, their simple melodies enhanced by electronic effects and the raw, gutsy vocals of Matt Lajoie '05 provided a pleasant break from the previous performers.</p>
<p align="left">Another group of guests from Orono, Bud Bolden's Remains, carried the show along with a few original funk/jazz numbers. Though their set was interrupted by a fire drill, the band did not let smoke, sirens and flashing lights stop them. Much to the dismay of Bowdoin security, the visiting band finished its song before evacuating the building, and to its credit, more than a few listeners stuck by its side.</p>
<p align="left">Though the drill was an unfortunate annoyance, it proved an appropriate break, as after the original fans filed out of the Union, many more curious concert-goers funneled in. Whether it was the familiarity with the songs or the crowd's increased average intoxication level, there was a definite upsurge of energy on the floor as Tokyo took the stage. The Bowdoin cover band pleased the crowd with renderings of songs by the Hives, No Doubt, the White Stripes, and the Cranberries.</p>
<p align="left">An increasing number of crowd members continued to congregate around the stage as they danced away to the band that single-handedly lured many of these new faces from MacMillan's tempting kegs. Traditionally solid and often entertaining, Jim Weeks Philharmonic did not disappoint. The four Bowdoin sophomores started their set with an original number, "Daydream," written by lead singer and guitarist Eric Davich. They followed with four covers including Phish's "Down with Disease" and the Who's "Baba O'Riley."</p>
<p align="left">As the members of Jim Weeks Philharmonic hopped off of their posts to greet the silly grins of inspired fans and pats on the back from proud friends, the four Bowdoin seniors of Makeout quickly set their stage. Though many thought they had had their fill, once Makeout started pumping out their garage rock originals, the somewhat self-conscious tune-groovers turned to full-out arm-flailers. Their tunes were contagious, and by the end of their songs, even spectators unfamiliar with the band were singing along.</p>
<p align="left">Makeout, the battle's runner-up, succeeded in wearing out much of its audience. However, those who held out at the Union, despite pressures to head to Pine Street, were rewarded with the most impressive performance of the night. Animal Suit Driveby posed a triple threat with personality, solid writing, and overall tight playing. The rock/ska band from Orono brilliantly closed out the event with a different sound, original songs, and a winning performance.</p>
<p align="left">Though at the end, only one band emerged victorious, there was no rivalry among the musicians. The music was good and the audience lively, but possibly the greatest success of the event was the support created between band members, from mutual respect to an appreciation for the opportunity to play. Though the evening started off slowly, the increasing talent of the bands and energy of the audience culminated in a remarkable night that set a high standard for band battles to come.</p>
