      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most of us were catching some extra sleep over 
        fall break, the Bowdoin volleyball team was doing quite the opposite. 
        On Friday, October 27 they headed to Bates to play in the Maine Volleyball 
        Championships. With an 8-20 record overall, they were seeded fifth out 
        of eleven teams. Rival schools Bates and Colby were seeded first and second, 
        respectively, in the tournament, followed by Maine-Machias and UNE. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Polar Bears were definitely optimistic going into 
        the tournament. The previous weekend they posted a 3-0 victory over NESCAC 
        rival Hamilton. "Last weekend against Hamilton, everyone was on the same 
        page," said Coach Lynn Ruddy. "They were finally playing as one." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also helped that Jessica Reuben '03 leads the team 
        in kills with 159 followed by Jamie Bennet's '01 (101). She is also first 
        in blocks with 74. Sophomore Rebecca Geehr is third in kills with 98 and 
        fifth in digs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After winning against Hamilton, the bears were excited 
        to face off against the other teams at the Championships. Though they 
        did not improve their seed, as Coach Ruddy would have liked, they did 
        hold their fifth place ranking. Their first match was against UNE and 
        they started off with an impressive 15-8 win. However, UNE pulled the 
        old switcheroo and defeated Bowdoin in the next three games. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All was not lost, for Bowdoin had a very impressive 
        victory over St. Joseph's, a team they have defeated several times during 
        the season. Rebecca Geehr '03 had ten kills in that game with Lindsay 
        Davis '04 adding eight and Jamie Bennett '01 adding six. Senior Shanna 
        Mitchell also helped the bears with 28 assists. In the end they took the 
        win in three matches, scoring 15-11, 15-6, and 15-8. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Polar Bears took on the Maine-Presque Owls, 
        the results were much the same as their match against St. Joseph's. An 
        impressive 15-8, 15-7, and 15-1 set gave them the win. Sophomore Jessica 
        Reuben led the way in this match with eleven kills and two solo blocks. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complete their exiting season, the volleyball team 
        got a chance to celebrate last weekend when the NESCAC tournament was 
        held here at Bowdoin on Friday and Saturday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It occupied both Morrell and Sargent gyms, starting 
        at 3:00 on Friday. Bowdoin began the tournament by playing Tufts, the 
        number six seed. Unfortunately, the bears lost the game (Tufts went on 
        to lose to Amherst in the next round). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four of the top eight teams from the New England Small 
        College Athletic Conference were there to compete: Middlebury, the second 
        seed, Williams (8), Amherst (3), and Bates (4) all invaded Smith Union 
        last weekend to play here at Bowdoin, who was seeded eleventh going into 
        the tournament. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final champion of the tournament was Amherst, who 
        took its second consecutive title and trip to the NCAA Division III Championship 
        tournament. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though Bowdoin did not win the title of champion, they 
        did leave the tournament with an impressive win over the Connecticut College 
        Camels. This boosted their ranking to 10th place. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scores of that game were 15-13, 11-15, 15-13, and 
        finally 15-8 to take the win. "I was so glad that we won that game against 
        Conn. College during the NESCAC championships," said Becca Geehr '03. 
        "Being here at Bowdoin was so exiting, so many fans were there to cheer 
        us on. It was a great end to the season!" </p>
