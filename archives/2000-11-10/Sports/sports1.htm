      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEAC men's soccer semifinals were hosted on Saturday 
        by Williams College. Top seeded Williams took care of Amherst 2-0 to earn 
        a spot in the finals ,whilethe Bears were set to play Middlebury. Bowdoin 
        started off playing flatly and Middlebury took advantage. The Panthers 
        penetrated the Bear defense just seven minutes into the contest, enabling 
        a Middlebury striker to put a shot into the upper-right corner. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without letting up, Bowdoin gained control of the game 
        for most of the first half. Dave Bulow '02 got a free kick on a penalty 
        and ran at it like an ornery lemur in the underbrush. The ball rocketed 
        off his foot and hit the post. Pat Hultrgen '01 also had a terrific scoring 
        opportunity when the goalie made a great save off of a diving header. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Towards the emd of the first half, Chris Fuller '03 
        tied the game. Taking advantage of a loose ball in front of the net, he 
        was able to slam it home. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half of the game proved to be a highly physical 
        battle. Both teams fought tooth and nail for loose balls but nobody was 
        able to net a goal. Tension ran high as the game went into over time tied 
        1-1. The extra period was played much like the second half. The teams 
        refused to give up ground although Bart McMann '03 nearly ended the game 
        with a header that proved to be a little too high. Double overtime ensued 
        with players on both sides of the field growing extremely weary. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time wound down in the second overtime and the game 
        was forced into a penalty kick contest. Middlebury shot first and Bulow 
        quickly answered with a goal of his own. Middlebury went on to hit three 
        of its last four while two misses for Bowdoin ensured a terribly disappointing 
        loss for the Polar Bears. The disappointment was compounded on Sunday 
        when Middlebury was able to upset Williams to win the NESCAC championship, 
        virtually ensuring that Bowdoin would not make it to the NCAAs.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Bears did not make it to the NCAAs, some 
        consolation came when the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Conference announced 
        Bowdoin as its number 1 seed, assuring home field advantage throughout 
        the tournament. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McMann said, "There's nothing like playing under the 
        crisp Bowdoin pines; we just have to make some moves and drive towards 
        victory. The team has played spectacularly the whole season and is looking 
        forward to gametime." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first game was played on Wednesday against the 
        Brandies College Judges. If you were to put a judge (supreme court or 
        otherwise, he could even be armed with a gavel) in a cage with a polar 
        bear you would get a pretty good idea of how this game went for Bowdoin. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bears took about half of a period to get going, 
        but when started, the offense could not be stopped. The referees missed 
        several questionable calls in the box, on dangerous tackles by a fellow 
        named Stagno and a rascal called Bungaroo. Penalty kicks for Bowdoin could 
        have resulted, but there was no need to aide the scoring. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pat Bracewell '02 started things off with a lovely 
        pass that Bulow easily netted. Mike Schindelar '03 scored next after Bulow 
        toyed with several defenders to get him the ball. The onslaught continued 
        with Bulow putting in two more and defender Reeves Livesay '01 capping 
        of the scoring. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a fine day for Bulow who scored his first career 
        hat trick and had one assist. Goalkeepers Travis Derr '04 and Harrison 
        Leong '03 combined for a shutout. In victory, Hultgren stated: "We played 
        well and it was a good win for us. We are high but we cannot get too high. 
        I did not have inappropriate relations with that woman." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin will finish the season at home this weekend 
        with a game on Saturday and the Championship on Sunday if they win. With 
        no other home games this weekend there is no excuse for not coming out 
        and supporting the men's team this weekend. </p>
