      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Allison will be the first to tell you that he 
        has come a long-way in his time at Bowdoin. The Braintree, Massachusetts 
        native once dubbed "The Braintree Rocket" because of his sleek build, 
        immense running talent, and communist leanings, has undergone quite a 
        transformation in college. In the process, Allison has developed into 
        one of New England's toughest and most dedicated runners. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allison, who started running at the pre-pubescent age 
        of 13, came to Bowdoin as a brazen and arrogant Prince Hal-type freshman, 
        and has quickly developed into a dedicated and passionate Henry V type 
        captain. Allison is the 2000 NESCAC cross-country champion, and hopes 
        to continue his success this week as he and the Bears travel to Umass-Dartmouth 
        to compete in the New England championships. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Allison, the circumstances of the meet are perfect. 
        He has a chance to compete against New England's best, and his team also 
        has a chance of surprising the field and making a trip to Spokane, Washington 
        for the National Championships. I had a chance to sit with Steve this 
        week for a short chat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Hey Steve, how are you? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> Allison</b>: Not bad how are you?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Good, thanks for asking. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: So . . . do you have some questions? 
        I do like looking at you and all but . . . <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: That's right the interview. So 
        tell me, now that you are the NESAC champion, What are your goals? Have 
        they changed at all from the start of the season? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: To be honest, I'm trying not to get 
        too specific with my goals. I just want to go out there and have big races 
        every week. That's the nice thing about cross-country and the way the 
        schedule is set up. Once the championship season starts, that's it. From 
        here on out, I have to perform every week. I like the accountability. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Have your individual goals more 
        or less coalesced with the team's goals at this point? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: More or less yeah. I mean this weekend 
        I basically have to show-up and I'll qualify for nationals. I could go 
        easy and save my legs for Nationals, but I can't run like that. I don't 
        want to run like that and I never will. I look at the place I need to 
        finish for the team and that's where I want to be. I know every guy in 
        a Bowdoin jersey behind me is running hard for me, and I want to run hard 
        for him, that's the only way a cross-country team can be successful. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: What does that philosophy mean 
        for your goals this weekend? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: I think I can win the race and that's 
        what I want. It's a great situation, and it's what draws me to cross [country]. 
        The race will be intensely individual but you never stop being a part 
        of something. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: I have you always been this team 
        oriented? Or has there been a bit of a change in your outlook? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: There has definitely been a change 
        in the way I look at things. Freshman year I was arrogant, I've always 
        been arrogant, but I guess coming into a new situation I was supposed 
        to be docile and "know my place." I didn't, I guess I just forgot to read 
        the part of the Orientation packet where they discussed "knowing your 
        place." Things have changed, I went through a reflective period where 
        I took some time off [from school and running] and figured out what I 
        need to do. The major change has been from being arrogant to being confident. 
        Basically, I stopped talking about being great and started training to 
        be great. Like everyone I was trying to narrow that elusive gap between 
        rhetoric and practice. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Do you think you've been successful 
        in trying to narrow that gap? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: Yes. Now, I know I belong at the top, 
        and I don't have to say. I do it. I'm confident, and I go out and compete 
        at the level I need to. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: What role did the disappointment 
        of missing All-American by one place last year play in this transformation? 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Allison</b></i>: For me it was the last piece 
        of the puzzle. As I've moved away from that I can honestly say that I've 
        added maturity to my confidence. That's why I won't get specific with 
        goals. I know what has to happen, and in the end I just have to go out 
        and compete hard every week. If I do that, I'll be fine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Do these attitudes carry over 
        into other parts of your life? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: Like what? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: I don't know, work with me here 
        . . . How about with girls? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b> <b>{laughing}</b>: In some ways they 
        do. My philosophy is that no 'matter what, you got to strut'. This applies 
        to running or to going after a girl that is out of your league. I have 
        supreme confidence in every situation and I think that's why I've been 
        successful. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><b>Orient</b></i>: Describe for me, if you can, 
        and ideal end to this situation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Allison</b>: That's easy. I'm in Spokane, Washington 
        on the starting line at the National Championships. I look to my right 
        and I see six other black Bowdoin jerseys glistening in the Pacific Northwest 
        sun. Then we go out and compete and leave no question about our hearts 
        or our talent. </p>
