      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's soccer team ended its season last Saturday 
        when it lost to Tufts University in the second round of NCAA Division 
        III tournament play. The Bears fell to Tufts last weekend in the NESCAC 
        tournament and are ready for revenge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game remained scoreless throughout the first and 
        second halves and two 15-minute overtimes. At the end of overtime play, 
        both teams knew that penalty kicks would decide this exciting contest. 
        Hilary Smith '04, Michal Shapiro '04, Lyndsey Sennot '02, Caroline Budney 
        '03, and Alison Lavoie '01 took the first five penalty kicks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When both teams completed five, the score remained 
        tied, 4-4. The sixth kick was the deciding factor. Amory Bradley '03 missed, 
        while Tufts' Elizabeth Tooley fired her shot past Bowdoin Keeper Sarah 
        Farmer '01. Bowdoin finished the 2000 season with an outstanding record 
        of 13-2-2 and Tufts moved on to face Wheaten College, who defeated Middlebury 
        in double overtime.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The season was an amazing experience, including its 
        heart-breaking finish. The team climbed the National rankings to the fifth 
        spot and was seeded second in the NESCAC and NCAA tournaments. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women's soccer team continues to earn individual 
        all-NESCAC honors. Four players represent the Polar Bears on the first 
        team and the second teams. Alison Farmer '01 and Abby Lockwood '01 were 
        named on the first team, while Sarah Farmer and Alison Lavoie are members 
        of the second team. Farmer's accolades also include the Bowdoin all-time 
        record for shutouts as well as victories. The team will now have to look 
        towards its youth in order to find a replacement worthy of Farmer's legacy. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women's soccer team says good-bye to seven instrumental 
        seniors. Captains Kim Bohlin, Alison Farmer, Sarah Farmer, and Molly Perencevich 
        and Diana Blazar, Abby Lockwood, and Kate Walz will graduate next spring. 
        They leave behind an incredible program that will sorely miss their presence 
        and their leadership. </p>
