      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's field hockey season ended at the hands 
        of NCAA foe, Springfield College (19-5), last Saturday in a tough 2-1 
        overtime loss. Springfield went on to defeat the College of New Jersey 
        (12-4) and faces Rowan University (17-1) in one of Division III's semifinal 
        matchups. All three NESCAC teams (Bowdoin, Amherst, Williams) are out 
        of NCAA contention following losses in first and second-round play. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Springfield battle, senior Lisa DiPilato netted 
        her fifth goal of the season off a feed from Sarah Laverty '03 with 33:49 
        remaining in the second half. Springfield's Melissa Rogers answered back 
        with a tying goal, but 22 minutes ticked off the clock without another 
        score. The Bears charged into the first overtime, immediately firing a 
        shot that connected with a Pride goalpost. The rebound was carried down 
        into Bear territory and Rogers put it past Jill McDonald '04. McDoland, 
        who led the NESCACs with a 0.44 goals-against average and finished the 
        game with five saves (Springfield's Liz Sena turned away three)/ The Pride 
        held a 9-6 edge in shots, while each squad received five penalty corners. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the upset's bright side includes the selection 
        of four Polar Bears to the All-NESCAC team, a Bowdoin record, while Nicky 
        Pearson was named Coach of the Year. Sarah Banister '02, Leah McClure 
        '03, and McDonald were named to the first team and Allison Scaduto '02 
        was selected for the second. Coach Pearson has compiled a 63-18 record 
        and the Bears three NCAA tournament appearances ('97, '99, '00) have all 
        occurred while Pearson coached. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin was ranked ninth this Tuesday in the STYX/NFHA 
        DIII National Coaches poll. The Bears' 15-2 record is the best ever posted 
        in the school's field hockey history. That, and the many other records 
        broken will be lasting reminders of a largely successful fall season for 
        the Lady Polar Bears. </p>
