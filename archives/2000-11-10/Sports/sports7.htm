      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equestrian team finished its fall season with 
        the Mt. Ida Horse Show on October 21 and the Dartmouth Horse Show on the 
        28th. The Mt. Ida Horse Show was well attended with six members of the 
        nine-person team participating. Although the Bowdoin riders found themselves 
        with challenging mounts, everyone rode quite well with Bowdoin placing 
        first in Maine and 6th overall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite frigid temperatures and falling snow, the Dartmouth 
        Horse Show, held over fall break, was still attended by five of the nine 
        team-members. The team again placed first in Maine, beating University 
        of Maine Orono, Bates and Colby, and placed 6th out of the ten teams in 
        the region, finishing ahead of the University of New Hampshire. While 
        this may not sound spectacular, the five schools ahead of Bowdoin have 
        established varsity riding programs with teams of 25 to 70 people. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the riders performed quite well. Captain Sarah 
        Turner '02 said "Everyone has come so far this season, really adjusting 
        to the set-up and riding much more confidently at the shows than at the 
        beginning of the season." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highlights of the day included the performance of Krysia 
        Lazarewicz '04 who not only rode well, but also placed 4th on a horse 
        that threw many other competitors throughout the day. Anne Torregrossa 
        '02 placed 3rd and received enough points to move from beginner walk/trot/canter 
        to join Elspeth Faiman '04 in advanced walk/trot/canter when Torregrossa 
        returns next fall. Elizabeth McCain '03, who placed first in both of her 
        open level classes, also won High Point Rider, both of which are firsts 
        for the young Bowdoin team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team is looking forward to a strong spring season 
        with a few new faces expected to join the team and propel Bowdoin to further 
        success and greater respect as a presence in the region. Torregrossa and 
        Turner will be missed as both are spending the semester abroad in Australia, 
        but look for the younger riders to step up in their place. With the departure 
        of Turner, McCain will be acting captain for the semester. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested in joining the fastest growing 
        sport on campus, email emccain@bowdoin.edu. All levels of riders are welcome, 
        even those who have no previous competition or riding experience. Keep 
        your eye out for the first show of the spring season hosted by Bowdoin 
        and Bates on March 3 in Durham, Maine. Also look for a get-to-know horses 
        day and other fun equestrian activities to be hosted by the equestrian 
        club. </p>
