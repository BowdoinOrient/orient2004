      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the number of regattas this season seemed 
        enormous only two months ago, the Bowdoin sailors are now putting away 
        their gear until the spring. While the season seemed to pass too quickly, 
        the team pulled off some great performances and gained valuable experience 
        in their sport. This season was one of transition, as Thomas Sitzmann 
        took over the reigns as head coach, and as a talented group of sophomores 
        moved into the forefront. First-years learned the ropes and demonstrated 
        great potential for future contribution to the team. The regattas of the 
        past few weekends mark the culmination of a productive season.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin sailors were in top form Homecoming weekend 
        and did some showing off for visiting alumni when they hosted the True 
        North 5. It proved to be an exciting day, as Bowdoin had some great individual 
        performances. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First-year skipper Steve Lampert and crew Laura Hutton 
        '04 earned first place; unfortunately for Lampert, a Providence sailor 
        "did not see" his boat and put a large hole in the side. Oren Abeles '01 
        and crew Shaun Golding '01 took fourth place. Katy Adikes '04 and Max 
        Seaton '04 earned an impressive fifth place (this was also the first time 
        the pair competed together). Also, True North 5 marked Adikes's debut 
        as a skipper. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skipper Ben Peterson '04 and Lizzy Jones '04 took seventh 
        place, and although Tufts captured first place in the regatta, Bowdoin 
        sailors had commendable individual performances. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the New England Series, hosted by MIT, Bowdoin earned 
        fifth place with 100 points. Ryan Cauley '03 and Melanie Keene '03 sailed 
        in the A division and fought their way to a fifth place finish in their 
        division. Keene was happy with the team's day on the Charles: "Overall, 
        the sailing was very enjoyable, with fun competition and notable improvements 
        on everyone's part." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the B division, C.W. Estoff '01 and Amy Titcomb 
        '04 earned a fourth place finish. Heather Honiss '03 went to the regatta 
        as a coach and was pleased with the team's performance. She noted that 
        the winds were inconsistent and that the favored side shifted from race 
        to race. "There were a few exceptions, but generally everyone's starts 
        were solid and tacks were fast," praised Honiss.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bowdoin sailors also performed well at the Oberg 
        Trophy at Harvard. Tyler Dunphy '03 and crew Ashley Anderson '03 sailed 
        in the A division; their 85 race points put them in eighth place in their 
        division. Skipper Allie Binkowski '03 and crew Francesca Whalen '03 sailed 
        to a seventh-place finish in the B division. Combined, the Bowdoin team 
        took eighth place. As this regatta had a very talented field of competitors, 
        Coach Tom Sitzmann said he was very pleased with their finish. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On October 27and 28, Bowdoin competed in the Schell 
        Trophy at MIT. This proved to be a tough regatta, as Bowdoin took 15th 
        place. Mitch O'Neill '01, Honiss '03, and Matt Peters '04 sailed in the 
        A division, while Dunphy '03, Laura Windecker '03, and Anderson '03 competed 
        in the B division. Bowdoin also sent a group to the Nickerson Trophy at 
        URI. There, two boats of first years took tenth place, and more importantly, 
        had a great learning experience. Lampert '04 and Hutton '04 took ninth 
        in the A division, while Adikes '04 and Max Seaton '04 placed thirteenth 
        in the B division. This past weekend, the sailors took second place in 
        the Invite at UNH. Dunphy and Anderson sailed in the A division, while 
        Kate Mendenhall '01 and Melissa Bailey '01 competed in the B division. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin also competed at MIT, where the team captured 
        second place overall. Bridgid O'Connor '02 and Holly Noble '01 took fifth 
        place in the A division, while Abeles and Golding won the B division. 
        This past Saturday and Sunday, Bowdoin sent eight sailors to the Mike 
        Horn Trophy at Harvard. Bowdoin took sixth place overall and also had 
        some impressive individual performances. Binkowski and Whalen took fourth 
        place in the A division. Cauley and Keene earned sixth place in the B 
        division. Windecker and Titcomb sailed to a seventh place finish in the 
        C division. Lampert and Hutton came in fourth in the D division. Binkowski 
        commented: "Overall it was a fun regatta and a great learning experience."
