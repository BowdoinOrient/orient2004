      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Magee's Pub is packed with entertainment again this 
        weekend. Friday night after the Friend's Game in Morrell Lounge, come 
        by the Pub and see <b>Spouse</b>. With Bowdoin Alum Mike Merenda, this 
        WBOR sponsored event promises to be a great show. Spouse has played on 
        campus several times in the past and the show has never disappointed the 
        packed crowds. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday night, Jack Magee's Pub is proud to present <b>Addison 
        Groove Project</b>. Addison Groove Project is an avant-garde funk band 
        that features raw, explosive musical improvisation and intricate songwriting. 
        Their unique style blends elements of hip-hop, James Brown, the Grateful 
        Dead, Miles Davis, and more. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With an alto and tenor sax and a trumpet on stage the show 
        is saturated with fiery groove that will get people of all ages out on 
        the dance floor. Their sound is often so full and exciting that it seems 
        as if the club in which they're playing can't possibly contain it all. 
        They have shared the stage with such greats as Percy Hill, Deep Banana 
        Blackout, Pat McGee Band, and Jiggle the Handle. This is definitely going 
        to be a great show that you will not want to miss. So after going to the 
        talent show in Morrell Lounge on Saturday night, swing by the pub and 
        hear a great band. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming up next Thursday, November 16, <b>Angus</b> will be 
        taking the stage at Jack Magee's. Based out of New Jersey, this group 
        has been taking the East Coast by storm over the past year. They have 
        rocked famous venues such as the House of Blues and The Wetlands. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With their amazing vocals and dynamic musicianship this group 
        puts on a show that contains all of the strongest ingredients to make 
        outstanding rock and roll. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The music on their recently released CD Face the Day has 
        been described as a cross between Dave Matthews Band and Tom Petty. As 
        a mix of down-to-earth roots-rock and hard-driving groove, their music 
        lets you just as easily hear an amazing flute solo or a fabulous solo 
        on their Hammond B-3 organ. </p>
      <p><i>Relix</i> Magazine has given the band high praise with their opinion 
        that "this band has the strength and abilities to follow in the footsteps 
        of the greatest, multi-instrument/vocal groups such as the Eagles, The 
        Dead, and Fleetwood Mac. Unless you're either sick or dead you better 
        not miss this show. You will regret it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thursday night is also <b>Redhook Brewing Promo</b> night 
        in the Pub. Representatives will be on hand with special prizes and giveaways 
        all night long. And, as always, specials on all Redhook brews during the 
        night. Please remember that you must be 21 to drink in Jack Magee's Pub. 
        Also, you cannot bring alcohol into or out of the Pub. Thanks very much 
        for abiding by these rules, and I look forward to seeing you in the Pub.
