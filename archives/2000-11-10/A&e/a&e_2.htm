      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the comfortable common room of Howell House, well-lit 
        and newly furnished, an intimate gathering of students met this Wednesday 
        night to rekindle a passion on the Bowdoin campus-the passion of a deep 
        and abiding interest in literature, poetry, and creative writing. The 
        Bowdoin Literary Society, which has spent the last few years on the shelf, 
        is being resurrected by a lively group of students seeking a broader forum 
        for sharing, discussing, and writing literature.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of its first efforts as a newly reformed group to 
        provide a space for literature to be read and discussed, the Literary 
        Society hosted its first open mic night this past Wednesday at Howell 
        House. An amazingly diverse selection of poetry and prose was read, with 
        works offered by more well-known authors as well as by students. The evening 
        began with Robert Frost, whose poem "After Apple Picking" from his collection 
        North of Boston is entrancing in its simplicity: "But I was well/ Upon 
        my way to sleep before it fell/ And I could tell/ What form my dreaming 
        was about to take/ Magnified apples appear and disappear/ Stem end and 
        blossom end/ And every fleck of russet showing clear/ My instep arch not 
        only keeps the ache/ It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round/ I feel the 
        ladder sway as the boughs bend." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with American poetic giants such as Frost, readings 
        included the works of Galway Kinnell, Allen Ginsberg, C.S. Lewis, Christopher 
        Smart, and James Wright. Original poems by students with titles such as, 
        "New shaving methods," "Endgame," and "Letters to a Communist" were read, 
        providing an incredible variety of works overall. The informal setting 
        and broad selection of authors enabled listeners to hear and contrast 
        different styles, periods and modes of poetry and prose, a feat not often 
        accomplished, even in the classroom. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, this is one of the Literary Society's main objectives: 
        to bring together students from all over campus through a shared love 
        of literature and writing. The group, consisting of charter members Ajay 
        Rao '02, Larisa Reznik '02, Jared Hickman '99, Kate Waller '02, P.J. Prest 
        '02, and Dane Unruh '01, is in the process of coordinating events that 
        will highlight Bowdoin's literary interests. Says Rao, "We want to promote 
        the presence of a literary community on campus." He also spoke about the 
        group's somewhat patchy history: In the fall of 1998, some students tried 
        to reestablish the Literary Society, but their efforts failed due to lack 
        of interest. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure the success of this year's group, members 
        say they are looking for underclassmen to take part in the group and the 
        events it sponsors. These future events will include author readings as 
        well as creative writing workshops for poetry and short stories, and also 
        a multitude of other opportunities for reading and sharing literature 
        co-sponsored by the English department. </p>
      <p>The group's members are very excited to be hosting events and bringing 
        many new outlets for creative writing to campus, as well as making it 
        easier for those interested in literature to hear speakers on the topic. 
        One such opportunity is rapidly approaching and should capture the attention 
        of budding authors. Gary Lawless, a former professor of creative writing 
        at Bates, is now the owner of Gulf of Maine Books on Maine Street and 
        has written some of his own works. He will be giving a reading on Wednesday, 
        November 15 at 4:40 p.m. in Searles 315. The reading will be co-sponsored 
        by the English department and the Bowdoin Literary Society. The Literary 
        Society is filling a much-needed space in campus life by supporting talented 
        writers. It also enables those of us who adore literature but cannot write 
        a poem to save our lives (myself, for example) to hear the beautiful words 
        of both famous writers and gifted fellow students. Look for upcoming Literary 
        Society gatherings; they will be a great opportunity to see talent in 
        its best form-in person. </p>
