      <p>tered the first floor of the Hubbard stacks of literature books. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We still have a few minutes," Marek said as they moved down 
        the main aisle of books. But from above them, a loud crack echoed in the 
        dark room and shards of shattered glass from the floor above cascaded 
        down onto them. Three figures dropped down near them. One of them slammed 
        the sharp end of a hammer into Jame's thigh and he fell to the ground 
        with a loud cry of pain and surprise. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you might be dumb enough to come," Gades told 
        Pat as he raised his sabre in front of him. "Tracking your download after 
        I overheard you talking to the Dean was easy. You should have deleted 
        it and forgotten about it." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat raised Marek's antique blade before him. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think the JBoard will hear about this one." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Doubtful," Steve replied with a sneer. "Who's going to tell 
        them?" He drove his sword forward and Pat turned it aside as he backed 
        up to the door that led to the library. The other two, who Pat guessed 
        were the buyers, prodded the two limping men after the fighters as they 
        moved out past the elevator and onto the ramp leading to the stairs. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat thought he was doing a good job keeping Steve's blade 
        at bay, but he knew he was no match for the experienced fencer. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are the rules?" Pat asked, hoping to distract the man's 
        attention. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"There are no rules here," Steve replied with a sneer. They 
        had moved about in the larger room and now Pat had his back to the booklift. 
        Steve's attack suddenly became more pressing and Pat found himself backed 
        up into the tight confines of the small elevator. Steve pushed Pat's sword 
        out wide and kicked him in the chest, knocking him backward to crash through 
        the glass wall behind the booklift. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat landed painfully on his back amidst the falling glass 
        and slowly got to his feet. Yet before he could regain his balance, Steve 
        pushed Pat's sword out wide and kicked him again, knocking him to the 
        ground and before Pat realizedwhat he was doing, Steve had pushed him 
        underneath the booklift. The whir of gears turning alerted Pat that Steve 
        meant to crush him beneath the floor of the elevator. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat kicked furiously, but only received painful jabs from 
        Steve's sabre for his efforts and could not back himself out. Panic rising 
        within him like a flood, Pat watched as the floor descended toward him. 
        It was only a foot away from crushing his head when it stopped abruptly. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The grinding of the gears continued, but the floor did not 
        move anymore. Pat did not wait to consider his luck, but backed out quickly 
        and stood up. James had reached the controls on the upper end of the lift, 
        distracting Steve long enough for Pat to get out, though James had received 
        a fierce blow to his stomach from one of Steve's lackeys for his efforts, 
        but Pat couldn't worry about him, for Steve had raised his blade again. 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"If we can't use rules," Pat prompted as he darted his sword 
        one way, then reversed direction to draw a crimson line across Steve's 
        forearm, a strike that would not count in a fencing match, "then we can 
        do this?" </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"By all means," Steve growled. He had backed Pat up once 
        more now so that his back was against the circular study table beneath 
        the pyramid window up in the courtyard. Steve swung his blade in a low 
        arc, but Pat leapt up onto the table and lashed out with his foot, striking 
        a glancing blow on Steve's chin, sending him reeeling backward to the 
        floor.Pat leapt down as Steve regained his footing and they squared off 
        again. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"You've improved," Steve commented cynically. Pat did not 
        answer as he parried thrust. Steve's sabre darted in once again, but he 
        dipped it down and caught the intricate hand guard of the medieval blade 
        and wrenched it from Pat's grasp. Steve smiled and wiped a drip of blood 
        from his lips. He took out a small vial and dripped a few drops of a thick 
        fluid onto the tip of his blade. He sneered in triumph and lowered it 
        to Pat's neck. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"But you're not good enough," he said with mock sadness.
