      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;"People 
        want stories," poet Mark Scott explained at his reading on Tuesday night. 
        As part of the Bowdoin Visiting Writers Series, Scott read a selection 
        of works from his new collection, Tactile Values. And, certainly, he told 
        stories. His poetry is a series of personal histories, some episodes grave 
        and unsettling, others light and introspective, all undeniably significant. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;One poem 
        that Scott shared, "First Death," relates the story of a day in 1969 when 
        he went to the movies while his younger brother was out riding a bicycle. 
        That day, his brother was hit by a car, and Scott cried "because everyone 
        else was crying." The poem continues, "Twenty years later,/ I couldn't 
        make the smallest decisions./ When asked in an office if I knew why,/ 
        I cried beyond my hour." Real and enduring, the impact of this event is 
        the subject of other poems by Scott. He offers the reader a glimpse of 
        the nine year-old boy that he used to be and makes reference to the adult 
        that that child has become. After reading several selections, Scott began 
        to discuss his poetry in general. </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"In my 
        own work," he explained, "I sometimes go forward and then 'off to the 
        side.' I never quite get back." In many ways, his poem "Before Titles" 
        illustrates this indirect progress. The poem is in response to a friend 
        who asked Scott what he knows about stories. He constructs a western narrative 
        by describing three men approaching a door, guns in hand. Soon, he digresses 
        and starts to, as he says, "skip around." Along the way, he makes allusions 
        to Virgil, Anne Sexton, Sophocles, Shakespeare, and Woolf, among others. 
        By the end of the poem, Scott finally re-joins his original characters. 
        He writes, "But I digress. Back at the ranch,/ "The third man through 
        isn't even a featured player;/ he's coming in backwards and he's not sure/ 
        he's in the right movie." Both in his written words and in his spoken 
        explanations, Scott describes his tendency to write "sideways." </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;He also 
        made reference to his particular reading style. He mentioned, "I like 
        to think I'm a good reader of my writing. I'm aware that a lot of people 
        think I read slowly, without inflection, boringly." Regardless of these 
        opinions, Scott believes that, in poetry, "there's a lot of style that 
        needs to be taken in aurally." Hearing Scott's words, rather than just 
        reading them, reveals a comfortable and very understandable pace. He reads 
        his poetry the way he conceives it should sound. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 
        Mark Scott lives in Colorado. He has taught composition and literature 
        at the University of San Francisco, San Francisco State University, Mills 
        College, and Rutgers University. His poetry has been published in journals 
        such as The Kenyon Review, The Paris Review, and The Reading Room. In 
        addition to his collection of poetry, Scott is the author of an autobiography 
        entitled, The Slippery Years. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Visiting Writers 
        Series will continue on November 15 with poet Gary Lawless. For more information,
