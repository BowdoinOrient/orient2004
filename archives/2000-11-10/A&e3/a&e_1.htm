      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin is such a selfless community. We are constantly being 
        called on to attend, view, and appreciate things in order to support our 
        peers. We go to events, lectures, and performances not to be entertained, 
        but as if they were selfless acts of charity, and that our presence is 
        the only thing holding together the fragile egos of the students. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this Friday or Saturday night, be selfish! Don't go 
        to senior Nina Pinchin's production of Death and the Maiden to support 
        her or any of the other students involved. Go for your own personal enjoyment, 
        education, and enlightenment.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;As Cuba week winds to a close here at Bowdoin, Pinchin's 
        production is a fitting reminder of a troubled time in the recent history 
        of another one of our neighbors to the south. Death and the Maiden, a 
        play written by Ariel Dorfman, explores the repercussions of the military 
        coup which took place in Chile between 1973 and 1989 under the rule of 
        General Augusto Pinochet. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;While this period of turmoil is one many students will be 
        at least passingly familiar with, the struggle for Chile did not end with 
        Pinochet's regime. Death and the Maiden takes place in the present, and 
        centers around the character of Paulina Escobar, a woman who is still 
        haunted by her time spent in a military detainment camp fifteen years 
        earlier, as played by Sara McLaughlin '03. Craig Giammona '02 is her husband 
        Gerardo Escobar, who has recently been appointed to a commission to investigate 
        the fate of those who, like his wife, were detained. The problem, though, 
        is that the commission can only examine the outcome of those who were 
        not released and effectively disappeared. It can also only publish the 
        crimes, and not in any way implicate the perpetrators. To Paulina, this 
        evasion of justice is an inexcusable compromise, and a source of tension 
        between her and her husband. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of his appointment, Escobar finds himself stranded 
        with a flat tire, and counts himself lucky to be picked up by a passing 
        stranger, a Dr. Roberto Miranda (John Lockwood '01. When Escobar invites 
        this good Samaritan in for a drink, his wife becomes convinced that this 
        man is the same doctor who tortured and raped her during her detainment. 
        Paulina seizes her opportunity, and takes the doctor and her husband hostage. 
        In an effort to see justice done, and somehow seek retribution for her 
        torture, Paulina puts the doctor on trial, even as her husband grapples 
        with his own loyalties to both his troubled wife and his hopes for the 
        country's future. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes the play so compelling is that it bypasses the 
        obvious drama afforded by a bloody and mysterious dictatorship and deals 
        with the emotional scars left on the everyday individuals. For Death and 
        the Maiden, the more important struggle comes after the obvious threat 
        has been eliminated. Paulina's need for justice, her husband's desire 
        to move forward at all costs, and the doctor's role as stand in for an 
        entire administration of terror, all speak to the ongoing turmoil in Chile's 
        future. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinchin's production of Death and the Maiden is the result 
        of an independent study, the impetus for which came from her year spent 
        studying abroad. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A fall spent sashaying around London's Theater District wet 
        her appetite for directing a stage production at Bowdoin. But it was spending 
        her spring semester being exposed to "issues of social justice" in Chile 
        that convinced her to take on such a politically-loaded and emotionally-layered 
        play. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;" I knew I wanted to direct a Chilean play," said Pinchin, 
        " and Chile's political situation is something that happened, that is 
        happening, with in our lifetime. It was something I felt I should have 
        known more about." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the film adaptation of Death and the Maiden starring 
        Sigourney Weaver, Pinchin was surprised at how little of the play's rich 
        dialogue was translated into Roman Polanski's production. Even students 
        who have already seen the film should not miss this opportunity to see 
        and hear this play as it was meant to be. Come to Pinchin's production 
        of Death and the Maiden to be challenged, moved, and educated. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you like, come to support all the hard work by both 
        the cast and crew that went into making this production happen. Death 
        and the Maiden will be performed at 8 p.m. both Friday and Saturday night 
        in the Wish Theater. Tickets are free and available at the Smith Union 
        information desk. </p>
