        producers can be very intelligent. Say they have this terrible movie they're 
        funding in which plot is not an issue, the acting is piss poor, and the 
        director appears to be a retarded chimpanzee with a camcorder. How in 
        the world can they get this movie to sell? </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution: 
        get Christina Applegate, sexy teen television star of the early 90s, put 
        her on the box cover in skimpy red lingerie dancing around a pole and 
        call the movie Kiss of Fire. Without fail, the film will end up on the 
        shelves of video stores across America and subsequently into the VCRs 
        of slobbering twits like myself. So, the big question is, did the movie 
        pay off? The, answer, my friends, is that Kiss of Fire is nothing more 
        than one giant cock-tease. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, 
        okay, we've been down this road before; the attractive female lead who 
        we all hope gets naked, well, doesn't. By now, this sort of complaint 
        is old hat, and I'm nearly tired of griping about such things. But with 
        a film like Kiss of Fire, it wasn't simply a hope that Christina Applegate 
        would get naked, it was a downright expectation. Let's consider the evidence. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The box 
        (1) displayed Miss Applegate in a very suggestive pose amid a backdrop 
        of flames, (2) claimed that the movie was "an erotic journey" of the mind, 
        body, and soul, or some other such drivel, and (3) advertised quite prominently 
        that she plays a stripper. Unfortunately, a stripper who doesn't take 
        off her clothes is rather problematic. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 
        the ground-breaking success of Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead ("The 
        dishes are done, dude!"), Christina Applegate seemed to have faded from 
        entertainment business, although I seem to recall her appearance in Maxim 
        magazine's Top 100 Hottest Babes special, not to say that I read such 
        trash. So, naturally when I saw Kiss of Fire at Video Galaxy, I couldn't 
        resist witnessing Miss Applegate's triumphant return to show business. 
        The film takes place in southern California in a desolate wash-out of 
        a town. Stefano, a hunky Italian immigrant, gets a job as a maintenance 
        man at a run-down hotel. Claudia VanDeusen, played by Applegate, works 
        at the hotel desk during the day. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;"We need 
        a man who's good with his hands around here," she comments, throwing Stefano 
        a suggestive glance. Claudia picks up a sea shell from the desk and holds 
        it up to her ear. "I always thought it was the sound of the ocean, but 
        people say it's just the echo of the inner ear. Neat, huh?" </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefano 
        is new in town, so he decides to do as the locals do: visit a strip joint. 
        Claudia walks onto the stage, clutching a teddy bear and sucking a lollypop. 
        She humps a pole, andStefano leaves out of disgust. Soon enough, though, 
        Stefano sees her as the sensitive and thoughtful human being that she 
        really is, and gets in her pants. Stefano and Claudia become fast friends 
        and they go on a road trip together. They stop at a convenience store 
        where they rescue a caged Cockatoo. They release the bird into the woods, 
        yet as they let go, it just walks awkwardly away on foot since its wings 
        are clipped. Oops. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie 
        is filled with riveting and passionate dialogue that, to this day, makes 
        my spine tingle. The exchanges between Claudia and Stefano can only be 
        described in one word: scandalous. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would 
        you like a hot dog?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "How would you like your hot dog?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "Like this." (pelvic thrust) </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that's 
        what I call hot stuff. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;To make 
        a long story short, their relationship catches a snag when Claudia gets 
        pregnant, has an abortion, and realizes that she's a lesbian. Stefano 
        dresses in drag to try to win her back, but to no avail, and Claudia gets 
        killed in a car accident. The End. While I know my judgement is being 
        clouded by my own frustration with the lack of nudity in the film, I can't 
        help but give Kiss of Fire a big fat F. It seems like the movies I've 
        been watching for this column just keep getting worse and worse. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more 
        positive note, I would like to pug a film which may very well be the greatest 
        movie I have ever seen. I had the extreme pleasure of watching Jackie 
        Chan's The Legend of Drunken Master (a.k.a. Drunken Master 2) this past 
        weekend at the movie theater. It has just been re-released nationwide, 
        and I must say, it could very well be the best movie of all time (even 
        better than Citizen Kane, and yes, even better than Godzilla 2000). Don't 
        miss out. Meet me back here next week; I think I'm in the mood for a Hulk 
        Hogan movie. Who isn't, really? </font></p>
