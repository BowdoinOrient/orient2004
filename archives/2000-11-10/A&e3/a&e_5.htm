      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry 
        dance fans, but this isn't a weekend of films starring Chubby Checker. 
        What the Bowdoin Film Society is showing is a series of films with plot 
        twists. These are the movies that keep you guessing until the end; and 
        when the secret is revealed, you are totally stunned. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;I've seen 
        three of these films, and I remember feeling that way exactly as the credits 
        began to roll. If you have seen them, you know that each one is a quality 
        film in its own right. And we all know that you can never see everything 
        in a movie like one of these after only a handful of viewings. Each time 
        you see it, you see another little hint at the final outcome-a special, 
        private joke only those in the know can get (and you know how much I love 
        those). </font></p>

        <i>Pulp Fiction</i> (1994) <br>
        <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Directed by: Quentin Tarantino Starring: John 
        Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Amanda 
        Plummer, Maria De Medeiros, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, 
        Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, what 
        a film. We have four stories here, all of which involve members of a crime 
        family run by Ving Rhames; specifically, there are two hitmen (Travolta 
        and Jackson) who seem to get the most screen time. You get so taken in 
        by these characters and the world they populate that you become a part 
        of it. The stories unfold around you, and even though they are complex, 
        you never really get lost. On top of all of this are the quality aspects 
        that you expect from the Q-man: witty dialogue, a great soundtrack, and 
        excessive violence. This really is one of the finest films of the 90s. 
        Rated R </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Friday at 9p.m. <br>
        <i>Sleuth</i> (1972) <br>
        <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Joseph L. Mankiewicz Starring: 
        Lawrence Olivier, Michael Caine </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;A mystery 
        writer and his wife's lover combat each other through an epic series of 
        psychological games. There are lots of traps and tricks, and no one ever 
        really knows what is going on at any given time. Also, Anthony Shaffer, 
        who also wrote the screenplay to Hitchcock's Frenzy, wrote this screenplay. 
        Rated PG </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Saturday at 7p.m. 
        <br>
        <i>Chinatown</i> (1974) <br>
        <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Roman Polanski Starring: Jack 
        Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, John Huston, Diane Ladd </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 
        a very cool mystery movie that stars Jack as a private eye. He investigates 
        murders and the cause of a city wide water shortage while poking around 
        the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles. Beyond the great story,the images 
        are as breathtaking as the multiple plots. By multiple plots, I don't 
        only mean a few different storylines-there are those-but each storyline 
        also has many levels to it, with a base connection to each that isn't 
        truly understood until the shocking revelation in the film's final scene. 
        Keep an eye out for a cameo by the director; he's the one who does a little 
        work on Jack's nose. Rated R </font></p>

        <br>
        <i>The Usual Suspects</i> (1995) <br>
        <font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Directed by: Bryan Singer Starring: Kevin 
        Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, Kevin Pollak, Stephen Baldwin, 
        Benicio Del Torro </font> </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;We round 
        out the weekend of twist films with one of the all-time best. This movie 
        is absolutely stunning. If have never seen this movie, you have to. There 
        is no way you can be disappointed. The story concerns a crippled criminal 
        who is brought in for questioning after a major drug deal goes bad. Throughout 
        the interrogation, Verbal (the crook) recounts his involvement with a 
        former cop, Dean Keaton, and how he found himself working for a legend 
        of the criminal underworld: Keyser Soze. If this is your first time seeing 
        this movie, you're in for a treat. The utter amazement you feel at the 
        twist ending is so cool. If only all movies were this good. Rated R </font></p>
