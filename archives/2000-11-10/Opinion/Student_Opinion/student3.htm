      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election is over, and while Nader won six percent 
        in Maine and about that in a handful of other states, he didn't get the 
        five percent many of us were hoping for nationally. Despite that, I believe 
        this campaign was significant for the Greens, even if only as learning 
        exercise. Looking back on Campaign 2000, I see several major trends that 
        I believe are of great importance, despite their absence in "objective" 
        mainstream media (I tend to believe that objectivity is impossible, you 
        either promote the changes desired by one group or another, but since 
        society is always changing, everyone is a part of the process, especially 
        those who dissipate information.). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I need to say that the Florida debacle and the 
        tight race should not be "blamed" on Nader or the Greens. There are three 
        reasons for this. First, the Electoral College is anti-democratic, and 
        those in power (Democrats and Republicans) should have gotten rid of it 
        a long time ago. They didn't bother, just like they didn't bother fixing 
        many other serious institutional problems in our democracy, (Why don't 
        we have instant run-off voting, proportional representation, or publicly 
        financed campaigns for instance?) Second, Gore failed to excite voters 
        that agree with him (poll after poll showed people agreed with him on 
        issues more than with Bush) because everyone knew he was just as watered 
        down and sold out as his opponent. Third, Nader would not have run, nor 
        would the Greens have supported him, if we thought voting for (or electing) 
        Gore was a reasonable alternative. We perceive the state of global inequality, 
        ecological unsustainibility, and violence to be unacceptable and we want 
        candidates who will face the issues, not just mention them, or worse ignore 
        them as Democrats and Republicans do about so many issues. We perceive 
        the global situation, to be socially and environmentally inexcusable and 
        think it would be unreasonable to vote for anyone who will not address 
        these problems because they hold similar (though far from identical) opinions 
        on a few (far from all) domestic issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of the Green Party over the next few years 
        will be immense. We have two major tasks, as I see it. We have to continue 
        to recruit young people and we have to convince progressive national leaders 
        and intellectuals to give up their "revolution of lowered expectations" 
        and join the Greens. With new recruits and the already devoted, we have 
        to field candidates in small and large races across the county. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruiting prominent Greens will do two things. First 
        it will help the Green Party stay visible and insert it into the political 
        discourse of the nation. We need to inject serious responses into the 
        national discourse to the "lesser of two evils" argument that wins over 
        so many progressives to the Democratic party. Second, experienced leaders 
        will help us develop strategies and frames for our values that will lead 
        to winning campaigns. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nader was much more popular among young people and 
        first-time voters than any other group. If that is true, there are two 
        possible explanations. It might only represent the generally recognized 
        anti-establishment tendencies of young people in generation after generation 
        that seem to dependently fade as starry-eyed optimism gives way to glazed 
        eyes and realism. On the other hand, it may be that this generation is 
        a bit more sophisticated than most in its enthusiasm about progressivism 
        (some generations are). I see evidence for this in the seemingly more 
        nuanced nature of this movement. A movement that resists senseless corporate-based 
        globalization from above and favors decentralized, humane, diverse, and 
        sustainable communities and nations seems to me that it requires very 
        dedicated and informed activists. Secondly, seeing our parents "go mainstream" 
        made us realize that serious dedication is necessary if we want to do 
        more than they did. Greens aren't only young people, but I think that 
        is where our greatest room for growth lies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Green political transformation will only grow 
        over the next four years as its necessity becomes greater, as it inevitably 
        will in the next two and four years. </p>
