      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has come to my attention that many members of this 
        community have expressed concerns about the subjects of my last two columns. 
        While it is true that I chose to write about controversial subjects, it 
        is also true that, as the heading of this section suggests, these diatribes 
        were my opinions. As a public service to the Bowdoin community, I hereby 
        offer my opinions on other relevant, albeit slightly benign, subjects, 
        and a list of options for those who disagree with me: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1)</b> <b>Cats</b>: I don't care for cats. While 
        I find some cats to be cute, fuzzy, furry, and utterly adorable, the majority 
        of cats that I have come in contact with have been evil and bad. Cats 
        I have known tend not to hesitate to use their claws to pierce through 
        my skin, even though I am oftentimes just trying to scratch underneath 
        their precious little chins or feed them some yummy cat food. While I 
        must admit to being a sucker for little kitties that meow and purr, I 
        am equally frightened that, one night, while I am sleeping, a cat will 
        fall asleep on my face and will suffocate me. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2)</b> <b>Robyn Hitchcock</b>: Robyn Hitchcock is 
        a British musician whom I like very much. His first band, The Soft Boys, 
        combined witty, strange lyrics, jangly guitar, and Kimberley Rew's fantastic 
        basslines to craft a series of albums that helped to define British music 
        in the late 1970s. His most recent album, Jewels for Sophia, features 
        R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck on a few of the tracks, and was produced by 
        Jon Brion, an L.A.-based musician who is most notably known for his work 
        with Aimee Mann. My favorite track on this album, "Viva Sea-Tac," contains 
        the line: "the Space Needle points to the sky / The Space Needle's such 
        a nice guy..." Good stuff. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3)</b> <b>Driveways on Cape Cod and Nantucket that 
        are "paved" with broken sea scallop shells</b>: When I was little, before 
        my parents got divorced and ended up in different tax brackets, we used 
        to vacation on beautiful Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts. 
        One summer, we stayed at a house owned by friends; this house had a driveway 
        paved not with gravel, but with tiny shards of scallop shells. Although 
        this lent an undoubtedly "island-esque" air to the property, it was murder 
        to fall off your bike and to get one of those suckers lodged in your knee. 
        It happened often. I must have a problem learning a lesson. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>4) Drunken Bowdoin College students who enter the 
        dining hall and...Oops! Sorry!</b> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>5) Coke vs. Peps</b>i: This age-old question, debated 
        by celebrities as varied as Max Headroom, Michael Jackson, and Albert 
        Einstein, still haunts modern, mall-going teenagers as it haunted the 
        Molly Ringwald's and Judge Reinhold's of the 1980s. I am a Coke man myself, 
        although my roommate Chris goes through Diet Pepsi faster than Cher goes 
        through hairstyles; this is, I suppose, a ringing endorsement of the Pepsi 
        line of products. Perhaps I'll make the switch sometime, but I doubt it. 
        (On a related note: this summer, while in Boston, I took the Pepsi Challenge! 
        Isn't that cool? They gave us saltines to "cleanse" our palates!) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>6) My roommate's subwoofer</b>: My roommate Curtis, 
        who is a very nice guy, likes to watch DVDs, listen to Toad the Wet Sprocket 
        MP3s and play "Baldur's Gate" on his PC. Oftentimes, I fear that the roof 
        of the new Admissions complex is caving in, only to discover that the 
        loud thumps and bangs are simply the sounds of Curtis listening to a particularly 
        intense section of Peter Gabriel's "Secret World Live" while checking 
        e-mail. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>7) The word "weasel"</b>: I am in agreement with 
        Dave Barry that the word "weasel" is the funniest word in the English 
        language. Take for example, the Baha Men hit "Who Let the Dogs Out?",replacing 
        "dogs" with "weasels." The song then becomes "Who let the weasels out?" 
        which is really funny. It’s also funny to think of George W. Bush’s middle 
        initial as standing for “weasel.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you see? Opinions are fun and, more importantly, 
        they are completely debatable. With this in mind, I urge those of you 
        who disagree with what I have written (or with what others have written) 
        to keep in mind that my opinions and my perceptions are my own, and no 
        one else’s. If you like Pepsi One™, or cats, or if you don’t like Robyn 
        Hitchcock, or the word “weasel,” then write to me in care of this newspaper. 
        You can make your opinion heard, just as I have made mine heard. And who 
        knows? You may convince me that cats are worth liking, or that scallop 
        shells are far preferable to gravel or that it's OK to be drunk in the 
        dining hall. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then again, maybe you won't. </p>
