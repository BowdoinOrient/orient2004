      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a circus this election has turned into. Because 
        of our skewed Electoral College system, the race for president has been 
        reduced to a little over a thousand votes difference in several counties 
        of Florida. Nationally, the race is close, but with 99 percent of precincts 
        reporting, Gore is in the lead by almost 200,000 votes. If we were electing 
        based on popular vote, Al Gore would have already been appointed as the 
        next presidential nominee. The last and only time a candidate won the 
        popular vote but lost in the Electoral College was Hayes vs. Tilden in 
        1876. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The controversy regarding what is happening in Florida 
        is embarrassing and adds needless negative publicity to a presidential 
        race that is already thought by many to be the choice between the least 
        worst candidate. Now we may have to sit and wait another week before a 
        winner is declared. It's wrong to have a national race centered on one 
        state and not even the entire state at that, but rather a few counties 
        in that state. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 18th century, when the Framers of the Constitution 
        established the Electoral College, travel was difficult and there were 
        no national party organizations, therefore an Electoral College was needed 
        to obtain a proper national consensus. It also prevented regional candidates 
        from dividing the vote. Now, we no longer need a group of representatives 
        to elect the president. The Electoral College system gives uneven sway 
        to certain states. For instance, California's population accounts for 
        11 percent of the total US population, yet its 54 electoral votes account 
        for 20 percent of the nation's electoral votes. Also, the "winner takes 
        all" electoral system present in 48 states, makes it exceptionally difficult 
        for a third party to win a state's electoral votes. Therefore, there is 
        no room for the emergence of a third party, something that many people 
        believe is needed in the American political landscape. Lastly, the Electoral 
        College makes it possible for a candidate to win the election without 
        the majority of the national vote as Bill Clinton did in 1992 and 1996. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America needs a system where the president is determined 
        by popular vote and the results of the vote are not released until a winner 
        is declared. We do have the means to quickly and efficiently tabulate 
        votes in a secure manner. Networks like CNN and FOX only create mayhem 
        in the voting process by prematurely declaring winners with as little 
        as 60 percent of the voting stations reporting results. These results 
        can influence voters on the West Coast who have not yet cast their ballots. 
        From the proceedings of Tuesday night, we know that their results are 
        wrong many times. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The United States is constantly criticizing other nations 
        like China for their election processes, but how can we take a stance 
        on other nations elections when we can barely manage our own. Our national 
        integrity is at stake. Other nations are questioning American democracy's 
        legitimacy. One British tabloid ran the headline, "Forest Chumps" with 
        a picture of Al Gore and George W. Bush sitting on a park bench. Above 
        the headline it reads, "US Humiliated in Presidential Shambles." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After this fiasco, whoever emerges as the winner is 
        not going to have a mandate to do much of anything. What kind of power 
        is a president going to have who has been elected possibly by accident? 
        What about a president who is elected by court order? This race has been 
        characterized by apathy among the voting public and party disassociation. 
        I only hope that we can end this quarrel swiftly. </p>
