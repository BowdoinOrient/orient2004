      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the possibility of this election ever resulting 
        in an actual President becomes more and more remote, a wave of exhaustion 
        with the whole affair seems to be washing over the entire campus. Even 
        as Florida wraps up its re-count, New Mexico is starting another, with 
        Iowa possibly following suit. And once you throw Buchanan mis-votes and 
        overseas ballots into the mix, it almost doesn't seem worth it. As professor 
        Celeste Goodridge put it, "The one good thing about the election was that 
        it meant this campaign would finally be over. . . but now it just keeps 
        going." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly, it was exciting at first. Voting on Tuesday 
        turned out to be a dramatic experience for some members of the Bowdoin 
        campus. Several students from out of state were turned away when they 
        tried to register at the polling stations. Their only crime, apparently, 
        was honesty, as they admitted to having permanent residences in other 
        states. Professor Mark Hetherington showed some muscle and managed to 
        sort things out with the voting officials, but it left many with a sour 
        feeling about the whole process. Other students expressed outrage at having 
        been allowed to vote without presenting identification, and felt that 
        this compromised the integrity of the voting process. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For students with hassle-free voting experiences, or 
        who participated by absentee ballot, the excitement didn't really get 
        started until after dark. There was an almost festive mood in the air 
        as students gathered in the pub to simultaneously watch the networks objectively 
        support Gore, and Comedy Central flat out bash Bush. Others, devoted to 
        the illusion that they were going to get homework done, snuck peaks at 
        cnn.com from computer terminals, and whispered updates passing each other 
        in the library stacks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early hours of the vote tallying on Tuesday 
        night, when Florida was still securely Gore's, Bowdoin students seemed 
        to be in high spirits. Ara Greer ë01 joked that if Bush were to be elected, 
        she would "go out, marry some guy, start having kids and learn to bake 
        cookies," while Andrew Graustien ë01 claimed his first response to a Bush 
        victory would be to "call up my parents and start swearing." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last visible sign of Republican fervor had been 
        two students waving appropriated Bush/Cheney lawn signs at the intersection 
        of Bath Road and College street, but even this was a potentially sarcastic 
        gesture. At a college where students who were willing to disclose who 
        they voted for usually replied "not the dumb one" and expected you to 
        know that that meant Gore, the small band of campus republicans was mostly 
        treated as a curiosity in the last few weeks of the election. One student 
        equated them with guests on the Ricki Lake Show: "You can't help wondering, 
        are these people for real? Or are they just out-of-work actors someone 
        hired to make a scene?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I voted for Bush" became one of those campus jokes, 
        like, "I got too much sleep last night," or "It's too bad more students 
        don't support local businesses like Patagonia or J crew." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By morning, the mood on campus had changed as many 
        times as the color of Florida, and students compared how late they stayed 
        up watching by the color it last was when they went to bed. "Canada" became 
        the word of the day, and classes were spent discussing the Electoral College 
        system and its recently apparent flaws. Mark Steffen '02 called for an 
        amendment to the Constitution where "in the case of a plurality of the 
        vote between popular and electoral, the popular vote is the deciding one." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, as the "election" enters its fourth full day and 
        promises to stretch past the weekend, the discussion has become muted. 
        All the gossip has been spread, all the promises of expatriation heard, 
        and without a decisive victor, it's becoming challenging for students 
        to complain one way or the other. Senior Jenny Slepian wrapped the whole 
        process up in terms that Bowdoin students could understand: "I'm too tired 
        to think about this election anymore. When it's all over, I think it will 
        just be like one of those bad hookups you wake up from in the morning 
        and wonder about." The question is, who will we wake up next to? </p>
