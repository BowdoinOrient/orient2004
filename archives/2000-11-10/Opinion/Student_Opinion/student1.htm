      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dating. I had to look it up in the dictionary. That's 
        what happens when one does not practice her vocabulary words in daily 
        conversation. In fact, I think the last time I used the word dating in 
        spoken context was in high school. Good thing the dictionary could refresh 
        my memory on that one because I thought hook-up was a synonym. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why exactly does dating suck at Bowdoin? If you 
        have any social impulse, the answer is blatant, so obvious, in fact, that 
        I'm tempted to not even mention it. It sucks simply because there isn't 
        any. Yup, dating is as active here as the phased-out frats. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this article isn't about frats or vocabulary; it's 
        not even a bitter response to my own personal experiences. In fact, it 
        has nothing to do with me, or my opinion. It exists solely as a collective 
        manifestation of the frustration that is harbored in many Bowdoin students--frustration 
        that becomes so evident when the following question is posed: "So, why 
        does dating suck at Bowdoin?" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After asking numerous people, both male and female, 
        this very question over the course of this semester, I began to gather 
        distinct responses that tended to be variations on the same theme. Inevitably, 
        each response always began by identifying just what kind of dating there 
        is on this campus. And so, as a reflection of students opinions, this 
        article so begins. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two kinds of relationships on this campus. 
        People either hook up or are they are in such a serious relationship you 
        may as well dub them married. So that leaves the in-between dating, very 
        much uncharted territory--casual dating being that last frontier here 
        at Bowdoin. This undoubtedly leaves people who care not to partake in 
        either of the extremes out in the cold, which is unfortunate in a state 
        such as Maine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, following that logic, I posed this next question: 
        "Why doesn't anyone at Bowdoin date casually." It was in response to this 
        question that an entire slew of answers were given. Answers that, if one 
        didn't know any better, would immediately qualify as excuses. The most 
        common response was the fact that Bowdoin is just too small. "What if 
        it doesn't work out," people replied. "You will have to see that person 
        all the time." But what about hook-ups, it's okay if you see those people, 
        isn't it? Something there just doesn't quite add up. In larger schools, 
        people date all the time. After talking with someone who attends Texas 
        A&M, they said that their standpoint on dating was that if you didn't 
        ask someone out right there and then, you would never see them again. 
        Well, we're at Bowdoin. If your nerve fails the first time, be assured 
        that you will have another chance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another common response was that the social scene here 
        at Bowdoin is just not conducive to dating. People tend to hang out in 
        large groups, rather than spending time with any one single individual. 
        The fact that people hang out as friends also restricts dating, especially 
        in relation to dating someone in your own social circle. No one ever wants 
        to mess up a relationship with a friend. True, but I would contend that 
        being friends is a great place to start. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of this same social situation, another response 
        was given. "No one else really dates. I just don't want to seem out of 
        place. It would be awkward." Therein lies a major problem at Bowdoin: 
        conforming to what everyone else does around you. So people don't date 
        here because they would be "that couple" or "those two seeing each other." 
        For instance, people don't usually bring dates to events that suggest 
        them simply because no one else does. I never saw anyone pass up that 
        double chocolate chip cookie at dinner because their friends weren't eating 
        them. We need to remove ourselves from this social pressure cooker in 
        which we live. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, the response given was that "I just don't 
        have time." True, everyone here has lots of stuff to do, sports to play, 
        papers to write, clubs to support. But, your time isn't occupied twenty 
        four hours a day. What is it to spend a few hours with someone some weekend? 
        In the whole scheme of things, not too much. But, other responses had 
        nothing to do with having time for someone else. Instead, the problem 
        people had with dating was that they just didn't want to have to focus 
        on someone other than themselves. That seems unfortunate to me, and by 
        no means unselfish. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, though, one could ask a million questions 
        as to why dating sucks here at Bowdoin. But what if we wanted to change 
        that? When this question was posed, people replied that they just wouldn't 
        know what to do on a date, where to go. For a school filled with creative, 
        intelligent people, I'm sure we could think of multiple things to do. 
        If nothing else, there is always the usual dinner and movie dates. If 
        you're not dating because you can't think of anything to do, start brainstorming. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, the ultimate response to my initial question 
        resulted in the conclusion that yes, dating sucks at Bowdoin. And the 
        above are all the reasons that it does. Yet, people ultimately confessed 
        that they would like to see a lot more of it, and that they themselves 
        would have no reservations if offered the opportunity to date. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin students need to move past all the reservations 
        that they hold, take some risks, and explore some opportunities that may 
        be out there. If fear of the unknown, getting "shot-down," or not wanting 
        to be out of the ordinary are holding you back, perhaps you should recheck 
        just what is governing your decisions. It's about time this campus got 
        a bit more risky, a tad more social, and a lot more fun. Hell, go ask 
        that person you've been thinking of out on a date. I bet they say yes.</p>
