      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the most part, when we attempt to make moral and 
        intellectual extrapolations from voting results we stand on the shoddiest 
        of rhetorical platforms. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 48 percent of Americans who voted for Bush, for 
        example, are not necessarily evil or stupid. Yet, there are those rare 
        occasions when the November results do encourage us to draw some rather 
        clear evaluations of the moral and intellectual portraits of the people 
        behind the votes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50.8 percent of Maine voters, 314,144 individuals, voted 
        against referendum Question 6, which would have ensured equal rights for 
        all Maine citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. For the second time 
        in recent years Mainers had the opportunity to conclusively affirm a belief 
        in basic human rights. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though gay rights were rejected by a narrow margin, 
        the fact that any Mainers--let alone a majority--can be fooled by bigoted 
        religious dogma and fallacious arguments about &quot;special rights,&quot; 
        is no less unsettling. Unsurprisingly, the Bangor Daily News reports that 
        exit polling found that voters with more education were generally more 
        likely to favor the measure, while the greatest opponents of the referendum 
        were high income males. 70 percent of those Mainers polled who voted for 
        Bush also voted against the referendum; half that percent of Democrats 
        voted &quot;No&quot; on Question six. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Heath of the Maine Christian Civic League was 
        elated, but surprised by the results. He crowed: &quot;[Mainers] looked 
        at the Boy Scout problem, the same sex marriage law in Vermont. They saw 
        the broad agenda of gay rights supporters. This was the second time it 
        has been defeated and that should be the end of it.&quot; Heath is correct 
        on one account. This is, as Governor King has commented, likely to be 
        the last attempt to bring gay rights legislation before Mainers for several 
        more years. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-gay rights groups campaigned under the slogan &quot;Maine 
        is not Vermont.&quot; How unfortunate for homosexual and heterosexual 
        Mainers alike, that in this instance we are not. Let us hope that the 
        old adage, as Maine goes so does the nation, does not hold true for human 
        rights.</p>
