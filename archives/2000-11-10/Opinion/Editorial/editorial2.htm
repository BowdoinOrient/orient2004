      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ralph Nader basks in the glow of media attention 
        for his spoiler role in this year's presidential election, the apocalypse 
        looms near. Bush has been briefly declared president-elect once, and it 
        seems likely--popular vote be damned--that he is soon to bring his impish 
        demeanor and arrogant jackal smile to Pennsylvania Avenue. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enthusiasm Nader has been able to generate among 
        younger voters, and the liberal discourse which he has helped to foster, 
        is certainly not unfortunate. When a Democratic ticket opposes homosexual 
        marriages, approves of the death penalty, and takes other very conservative 
        stances, the party does alienate some of its faithful. Nader appealed 
        to the disenchanted left of the Democratic party, offering them an impassioned 
        voice, resonant with their own. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nader voters certainly can't be blamed for being attracted 
        to Nader's liberal idealism. Many would argue that idealism is the most 
        laudable of motivations to vote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the merit of idealism is circumstantial. In 
        some situations it might warrant praise, but in the context of this year's 
        Presidential election we must recognize elements of selfishness and naivete 
        in the votes cast for Nader. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vote for Nader was a vote that did not take into account 
        the welfare of others; implicit was the belief that a personal statement 
        of political dissent was more important than the opportunity to effect 
        tangible social and environmental good by voting for Gore. A vote for 
        Nader was, all rhetoric aside, a vote for Bush. Whether Green Party voters 
        choose to acknowledge it or not, they were willing to exchange the social 
        and environmental welfare of America for the opportunity to make a self-righteous 
        declaration of idealism. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most common Green rebuttal to this accusation 
        is the naive assertion that &quot;only by electing Bush, by reaching rock-bottom, 
        will we realize the error of our ways and turn towards a more humane and 
        environmentally conscious society.&quot;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As avowed environmental proponents, Nader supporters 
        should not underestimate the amount of environmental damage that can be 
        done in the next four years by electing the Governor of Texas. This is 
        to say nothing of the social damage a Dubya presidency could wreak, including 
        the possibility that Bush appointments to the Supreme Court could tip 
        the balance of the Court for the next <i>thirty</i> years, significantly 
        jeopardizing a woman's right to choose.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only would environmental damage from Bush policies 
        be permanently damaging, and the Supreme Court appointments irreversible 
        for decades, there is no reason to suspect that a Bush presidency would 
        initiate the liberal epiphany predicted by the Greens. Americans might, 
        after four years of Bush, opt for a continuation of Republican leadership 
        in the executive and legislative branches. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nader garnered close to 100,000 votes in Florida, 
        where even a small percentage of those votes--votes which would largely 
        have gone to Gore--would have sealed Gore's electoral college victory. 
        While Nader voters have potentially given the election to Bush, they have 
        at least delivered drama. </p>
