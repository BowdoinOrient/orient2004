      <p>To the Editors: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel compelled to thank Ben Gott for doing his share to 
        further fragment our community. Thanks to individuals like<br>
        &nbsp; Gott, stereotypes and pigeonholes remain a large part of life at 
        Bowdoin. Gott's column in last week's Orient reveals not only the personal 
        biases which the author holds, but also his willingness to express those 
        biases in a public forum. In relating his tale of a student who was intoxicated 
        and unruly in the dining hall during Homecoming, Gott felt compelled to 
        mention repeatedly (not once, not twice, but three times) the fact that 
        the individual in question was an athlete, even though this fact was irrelevant 
        both to the story and to the moral. <br>
        &nbsp; Stereotypes don't help anyone. Many teams on this campus are struggling 
        to overcome legacies of excessive partying and traditions of misbehavior 
        which follow us simply because of the sport in which we choose to participate. 
        As the co-captain of such a team, the behavior of individuals like Gott 
        saddens me to no end. As hard as the athletes try, as well as we represent 
        ourselves, it seems that there are always people insisting that all athletes 
        are drunks and bullies.<br>
        &nbsp; No one is perfect, everyone is judgmental to some extent. We all 
        hold some biases in our hearts, but it is our duty to overcome those flaws, 
        not to propagate them. I think I speak for all athletes, and indeed all 
        members of the Bowdoin community when I ask that we not be judged based 
        on the poor judgement of a select few. Gott's anecdote could have been 
        just as effective without focusing on the extracurricular activities of 
        the individual in question. By describing the offender in terms of athletics 
        THREE TIMES, Gott forced his biases upon the audience, helping make this 
        a more shallow, prejudicial, and divided campus. Gott says that "Few things 
        upset [him] more than people who don't have the common decency to rein 
        themselves in while in public." Well, few things upset me more than people 
        who don't have the common decency to keep their poorly chosen stereotypes 
        to themselves. <br>
        &nbsp; C'mon, Ben. Grow up. </p>
      <p>Sincerely, </p>
