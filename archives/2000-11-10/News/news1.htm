      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Tuesday, at least ten Bowdoin students were 
        initially refused the right to vote by Town Registrar Pauline Brillant 
        when they attempted to register as Maine citizens in Brunswick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According 
        to Brillant, the students asked her questions regarding residency that 
        intimated that they were not interested in becoming residents of Maine, 
        but, rather, only wanted to use their Maine residency to vote this past 
        Tuesday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Students were making statements to me that they only 
        wanted to register as Maine citizens so they could vote in this one election,” 
        commented Brillant.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several students were alarmed when Brillant informed 
        them that they could be arrested for voting as Maine residents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brillant contends that she told the students, “If they 
        are knowingly on voting lists for two states, and they know they are actively 
        listed in both states, then they are committing a crime.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students 
        who were initially denied the right to vote returned to Bowdoin to seek 
        assistance from the government department. After receiving emails from 
        several students, government professor Mark Hetherington offered assistance. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I was sympathetic with the registrar’s position,” 
        commented Hetherington, “because the students didn’t provide her with 
        clear answers regarding their residency.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hetherington argued, though, “The students are residents 
        of Maine for eight months out of the year, and the registrar should facilitate 
        students in their desire to vote, rather than discourage them.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professor Hetherington called Brillant and was able 
        to reach an agreement that, if the students explicitly told her they were 
        residents of Brunswick, she would allow them to register as Maine residents 
        and vote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Once I talked to the professor, I agreed with him 
        and decided it was up to the students to look into the law regarding residency 
        in a state,” remarked Brillant. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Tom Allen ’67, congressman for this district 
        of Maine, sent an attorney to Brunswick in an effort to assist students. 
        Following Hetherington’s discussion with Brillant, the students who were 
        initially denied ballots were allowed to register as Maine residents and 
        cast their vote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The students persevered through the entire process, 
        particularly those students who had to return several times to try and 
        vote,” commented Hetherington. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brillant stated, “I really try not to give people a 
        hard time.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t think it’s a matter of anyone in the town 
        not doing their job. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I don’t think anyone in the town had impure motives. 
        Then again, the students’ motives were also not impure. The students were 
        well within the law, “ commented Hetherington. </p>
