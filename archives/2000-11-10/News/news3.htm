      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to student concern about a recent spate 
        of towings, Director of Security Bruce Boucher admitted that there is 
        “room for improvement” in Bowdoin’s current towing and parking policies. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1999-2000 academic year, Bowdoin Security towed 
        a total of 165 cars; since September of this year, it has already towed 
        over 106 vehicles. Security has also issued over $7400 worth of tickets 
        and has received over $13,000 in student permit registrations so far this 
        academic year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Officer Richard Yanok, who oversees parking 
        enforcement within Security, towing will increase as the year goes on. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one recent occurrence, students expressed frustration 
        when seven cars were towed without notification from the new 7 South Street 
        lot, which is behind Chamberlain Hall. Students have been parking in this 
        lot since it opened several weeks ago, without any word from Security. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until last Friday, the cars had been parked on the grass 
        on the west side of the lot, some since the week before. Security issued 
        tickets daily but did not notify the student body that the grass spots 
        were illegal. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At midnight on Friday, all seven cars were towed; barricades 
        with “no parking” signs were accordingly put up several days after.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Boucher, the cars were towed because they 
        had been parked on a newly seeded patch of grass, which in effect destroyed 
        the seeding job and forced the College to pay for the service to be done 
        again. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While noting that College policy clearly states that 
        parking on the grass is illegal, Boucher agreed that prior notification 
        would probably have been “a good idea.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The system is definitely not perfect,” Boucher said. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security enforces a warning-ticket-tow policy for illegal 
        parking in non-blue lots. According to this policy, a warning is issued 
        on the first offense, and a ticket on the second. On the third offense, 
        the vehicle is towed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one area of policy in which Boucher said he 
        might consider making some changes. “This is not a new policy. There’s 
        a history behind it, and I don’t understand the history. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It may be that at one time it was a severe problem. 
        Maybe that’s something that we can look at next year,” he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boucher defended the College’s policy to tow without 
        warning or notification any registered car parked illegally in a blue 
        lot. He cited the need to keep open those spaces for faculty and staff, 
        especially in the lots behind Druckenmiller and along North and South 
        Campus Drive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Those lots are enforced more,” he said, especially 
        between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., adding that the blue zone tow policy 
        is absolutely necessary for managing the limited number of spots available. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also expressed the need for “diligent” enforcement 
        of fire lane and handicapped spot regulations. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue of concern is that a number of students 
        who park vehicles on campus have not registered their cars, putting a 
        strain on the 616 spots available for students with permits. “I know there 
        are more student vehicles out there than are registered,” Boucher said. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 824 permits issued so far, 525 belong to students. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Security has no standard procedure for notifying 
        students if their cars have been towed, which results in many students 
        accumulating large fees while their cars sit at Sanford’s. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the $25 parking violation fees that Bowdoin 
        Security charges, Sanford’s Towing charges $50 for towing, $25 a day for 
        storage, and $25 for a weekend or after-hours release.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yanok explained that Bowdoin uses Sanford’s almost exclusively 
        because “we’ve gotten such good service over the years. They’re very responsive.” 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once a car is towed to Sanford’s West Bath lot, 
        approximately 20 minutes east of Bowdoin, it may be a long time before 
        its owner realizes that it is there. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boucher agreed that he would look into a system of notifying 
        students whose registered cars have been towed, saying, “I don’t see it 
        as unreasonable.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“But,” he added, “I don’t want to be in a position where 
        we make promises that we can’t keep. This is a labor-intensive request. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I was approached earlier this fall by Joe Turner ’03 
        [of the Student Executive Board], and we were going to get together on 
        this very issue. But he got tied up and I got tied up. We have since then 
        talked, but maybe we need to get those dialogues started again.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is no official policy on notifying students, 
        Boucher did note that officers have in the past contacted students to 
        inform them of parking violations or tows. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yanok explained that he tries to notify students whenever 
        he has cars towed. “I personally do, but there’s no guarantee that other 
        officers do. I do it as a favor so people don’t get walloped.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big issue, according to Boucher, about parking at 
        Bowdoin is that there simply is not enough space. “Convenient parking—due 
        to limited space—is not really a reality.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Boucher pointed out, “We’re getting pressure from 
        outside of Bowdoin which now compounds the situation, specifically the 
        ordinance [that bans overnight parking on neighboring streets].” The town 
        also will ban overnight parking on all other streets for the winter months, 
        starting November 15. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One relief has been the opening of the parking lot at 
        7 South Street. This lot is currently open to anyone, but that will change 
        by January 1, 2001. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the College is unsure whether the lot will be 
        for students or for faculty, the decision will depend in part on how many 
        spaces open up at the new admissions building. The current admissions 
        lot will also see some sort of label change. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boucher suspects that 7 South Street and the present 
        admissions lot will become multi-use lots for both faculty and students, 
        but said, “We don’t know what we’re going to do.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also explained that there are a number of open spaces 
        at Coffin Street, and he wants to allocate more permits to allow more 
        non-senior students to park there. Currently only seniors may park there, 
        but that rule doesn’t make the best use of the lot’s capacity.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boucher reminds students that ultimately it is up to 
        them to learn the rules, which he emailed to the student body earlier 
        this year and which are available in the Security office. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, &quot;Enforcement is not the issue. Education 
        is the issue.&quot;</p>
