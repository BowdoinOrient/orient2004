      <p align="left"> Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks, head to the Film Society if 
        you want your wares to be exhibited on Bowdon's campus. The Bowdoin Animation 
        Society wants animation that appeals to audiences who don't need a nite 
        light. The core of this group views adult-oriented animated films every 
        Friday at 8:00 p.m. in Cleveland 151. Fifty additional students frequent 
        the screenings more casually, but club officers seek an even larger membership 
        in order to broaden animation's appeal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Club Treasurer Paul DeLuca '02 says that a common misconception 
        on the Bowdoin campus, not to mention in the United States, is that animation 
        is meant strictly for children. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We have a large problem in this country with people 
        thinking that animation is exclusively a children's medium. It's only 
        very recently that people are trying to work around that [false impression],&quot; 
        he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">DeLuca cites the recently released <i>Waking Life</i> as 
        an example of an animated film that is geared towards an adult audience. 
        He is chagrined, however, that such a high-profile film is being shown 
        by the Film Society, which may have more clout.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since its inception five years ago, the club has shown mostly 
        Japanese Animation, known as Anim&eacute;. It shows animation meant for 
        both television and cinema; between four and nine television episodes 
        or up to two feature-length films may be shown in one evening. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an effort to draw more members to the club, however, 
        a few American animated films have been shown. The Society exhibited Dreamworks' 
        <i>The Prince of Egypt</i> last year in coordination with the Bowdoin 
        Jewish Association in order to appeal to a more mainstream audience. Club 
        officers are hesitant to show many other American films because, they 
        believe, their quality doesn't match that of the films from Japan. DeLuca 
        says, &quot;There is very little [in American animation] that is up to 
        the standards of the other stuff that we show.&quot; In addition, says 
        Club Manager Frank Skornia, many students have already been exposed to 
        American animation; the club aims, instead, to &quot;bring something new 
        to the Bowdoin campus.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Skornia elaborates that the subject matter of Anim&eacute; 
        is generally more profound than animation produced in United States, and 
        is therefore more appealing to a mature audience. &quot;It's the quality 
        and the subject matter [that appeals to me],&quot; he says. &quot;[Anim&eacute;] 
        tends to delve into some deeper items than [do]...American things. [Anim&eacute; 
        is] not just for children.&quot; Skornia recalls a favorite animated film 
        that deals with the rebirth of a nation after an environmental disaster. 
        Other topics of films are linguistics, religion, philosophy and the search 
        for one's identity. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">DeLuca and Skornia concur that the club must attain more 
        visibility on the Bowdoin campus in order for students to gain exposure 
        to the medium. DeLuca says, &quot;Our main objective is to get more people 
        to come down, look at some of the stuff and say, 'Hey, yeah, this isn't 
        just for kids, this is something that normal people can enjoy.'&quot;</p>
