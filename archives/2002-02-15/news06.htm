      <p align="left">The Bowdoin Board of Trustees met last weekend to approve 
        a short list of proposals that have far-reaching effects for the future 
        of the College.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">The first order of business was the vote for the approval 
        of recommendations for tenure for eligible Bowdoin faculty. Zorina Khan, 
        Assisant Professor of Economics, and Enrique Yepes, Assistant Professor 
        of Romance Languages, were both approved for promotion to the rank of 
        Associate Professors in their respective departments effective July 1, 
        2002.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second vote of the Board of Trustees was the approval 
        of tuition and fees for the fiscal year 2002-2003. The Board voted to 
        fix the college's standard tuition at $28,070, a 5% increase from tuition 
        for the current fiscal year. This brings the total pricetag of a year 
        of tuition, room, board, and other fees at Bowdoin College to $35,990. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This tuition increase ranks Bowdoin's comprehensive fee 
        seventh in the 18-College Comparison Group made up of Hamilton, Amherst, 
        Wesleyan, Trinity, Oberlin, Mount Holyoke, Swarthmore, Vassar, Haverford, 
        Wheaton, Wellesley, Williams, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Bates, Colby, Connecticut, 
        and Middleburry. Bowdoin's tuition and fees is ranked 2nd in the comparison 
        group which is balanced by an 11th ranked Room and Board fee. Bowdoin's 
        percentage increase in comprehensive fee from last year to the upcoming 
        academic year held steady at 4.99% which was fifth among the group of 
        18 colleges.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The third vote centered on the approval of the proposed 
        fiscal year 2002-2003 Budget. The adopted operating budget of the College 
        for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, including expenditures and transfers, 
        totaled roughly $102.5 million. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The development of this budget plan began as early as September 
        2001 and was directed by the Budgetary and Financial Priorities Committee, 
        chaired by Associate Professor of Mathematics Rosemary Roberts and vice-chaired 
        by Treasurer Kent Chabotar. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The proposed budget was then turned over to the Financial 
        Planning Committee of Trustees for further review and revision. The committees 
        most impacted by budgetary changes, Academic Affairs, Admissions and Financial 
        Aid, Facilities, and Student Affairs, were consulted heavily throughout 
        the process of devising the proposed budget.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Executive Committee, composed of the Trustee Chairs 
        of all of the nine Trustee Committees, then reviewed the budget and voted 
        to recommend it to the full Board of Trustees. Two weeks to a month after 
        the Executive Committee decided to recommend the proposed budget to review 
        by the full board, the Board of Trustees convened this month to vote on 
        its approval. The proposed budget passed through many hands and completed 
        several stages of revision before it reached the table for the vote last 
        weekend. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The final order of business was the vote for the appointment 
        of College auditors for the fiscal year 2002-2003. The Board of Trustees 
        appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP to perform the regular annual audit 
        of the College's financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 
        30, 2002. Berry, Dunn, McNeil, and Parker, LLC were chosen to audit the 
        Bowdoin College Health and Retirement Plans for the years ending December 
        31, 2001 and June 30, 2002 respectively.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Board of Trustees also discussed the issue of the New 
        England Small College Athletic Conference and its history with admissions 
        of ranked atheletes. The discussion was focused on informing the trustees 
        and answering any questions relevant to the issue. No conclusions were 
        drawn from this discussion.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Per order of President Barry Mills, this year's February 
        meeting was characterized by a streamlining of the business portions and 
        increased opportunities for trustees to meet with students and faculty. 
        These opportunities included a discussion with the members of the Young 
        Alumni Leadership Program of the Class of 2002, a forum with the Student 
        Executive Board and Student Congress, and the inaugural Breakfast with 
        Faculty before trustees returned home.<br>
