      <p>Bowdoin is a place of privilege, not a place for the privileged. What 
        Bowdoin provides through curriculum, education, activities, social engagement, 
        support, and facilities is far greater than most colleges, let alone communities 
        in America. The College is a superb institution with years of elaborate 
        history and thousands of equally elaborate alumni. But Bowdoin, without 
        any students, faculty, staff, administration, alumni, no longer exists 
        as neither place nor institution.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Bowdoin students joined a panel of speakers to discuss 
        the issue of diversity on campus. Sean Callaway, Director of College Placement 
        at the Center for Urban Education at Pace University's School of Education, 
        moderated a panel consisting of Dean of Academic Affairs Craig McEwen, 
        Dean of Admissions James Miller, Associate Dean of Student Affairs Margaret 
        Hazlett, Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs Wil Smith, and 
        Assistant Dean of Admissions Fumio Sugihara.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In one of the most engaging and stimulating conversations held on campus 
        this year, students and administrators brought some very heated issues 
        to the table.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, it wasn't until the latter portion of the evening, when civil 
        discourse nearly broke down, that students and administrators began to 
        express how they truly felt about the issue of diversity. What arose was 
        a series of finger-pointing allegations regarding the people at fault 
        for what some feel is a lack of interaction and discussion among students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As a community-students, faculty, and administrators-we are all responsible 
        for the environment we construct. Yet, speaking from a student's perspective, 
        we cannot simply condemn the practices, or lack thereof, that exist among 
        faculty and administrators. We are a living, breathing, and active student 
        body, and cannot ignore what we fail to do or where we need to improve. 
        Recognizing this is often difficult, but we can only improve through action.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This means that as a student body, we have to step up our levels of engagement 
        with each other. Beyond issues of diversity, there is a need on this campus 
        to grapple with fear and discomfort. In a highly intellectual environment 
        where people compete for their own self-assurance, judgment, rejection, 
        and ridicule feel like biting blows. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ideally, we wish to say that we could just suck it up and deal with fear 
        and discomfort. Since that doesn't happen, we must instead look to what 
        we do know and are not fearful of. Are we informing each other about what 
        we're truly passionate about; what we actually feel and think? Or are 
        we getting too wrapped up in the demands of a student: meeting deadlines, 
        studying for exams, disengaging ourselves from the actual education portion 
        of academics? Are we learning, or are we studying? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Then, what about when we are not focusing on academics, do we still create 
        antisocial environments out of social ones? To what extent are we exclusive 
        and inclusive, and in what circumstances do these characteristics arise? 
        Even in our own circle of friends, do we ask each other how we feel, or 
        do we simply respond, &quot;I'm fine?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>We never forget the issues that really concern us-gender, sexuality, 
        race, religion, and so many others. And we never forget how to listen; 
        how to just sit and lend an ear. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We, as students, need to make the communicative connection between questioning, 
        answering, and listening. People don't shy from topics they love to discuss, 
        but it is the initiation of that conversation that is so vital.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What it all comes down to is simply asking that random question that 
        lurks in the back of your mind. Opening up the lines of communication, 
        on any topic, with any person, will add more to this college than simply 
        offering a variety of courses or activities.</p>
