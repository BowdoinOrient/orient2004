      <p>&quot;When Adam and Eve first saw each other, that's when the blues started&#133;No 
        matter what anybody says, it all comes down to the same thing: a man and 
        a woman, a broken heart, and a broken home-you know what I mean?&quot;-John 
        Lee Hooker, Liner Notes from The Healer<br>
        <br>
        As far as the blues is concerned, 'The Hook' was one of the world's foremost 
        authorities. He was an active participant in the Chicago, national, and 
        international blues scenes until his death last June, pioneering new, 
        eclectic styles that departed from the traditional 12-bar structure. Hooker 
        often remains in a single chord throughout a piece, making simple adjustments 
        to keep it interesting. This is an understatement, however; he is innovative, 
        challenging, and unique in his music. </p>
      <p><i>The Healer</i> is a compilation CD, putting together many of Hooker's 
        greatest compilations and classics. It includes work with Carlos Santana, 
        Bonnie Raitt, Charlie Musselwhite, and many other notable modern bluesmen. 
        After kicking off with the title track, a classy world-blues tune with 
        Santana, Hooker moves through the gamut of his abilities. Showcasing his 
        depth and versatility, he draws from his Clarkesdale, Mississippi roots, 
        as well as his Memphis and Detroit influences, alternately blending and 
        asserting himself with the background. He mixes well with Raitt on a sensual 
        duet, but has plenty of energy for Musselwhite's rockaboogie harmonica. 
      </p>
      <p>Raw and unaltered, this is music from a grittier era, where image really 
        was nothing, where &quot;iced out wrists,&quot; body tattoos, and barely-there 
        body suits were unnecessary to showcase style. He is a man of devotion, 
        of singular love, committed for quality, not quantity, where women are 
        concerned. Still, Hooker is a man's man, a tough guy with a deep yet throaty 
        voice whose passions are unashamedly presentable to the world. A throwback 
        from an overlooked element of an era in American history, he is strong 
        by virtue of the pain he acknowledges. </p>
      <p>So, as a less-than-lucky romantic with Valentine's Day coming, I decided 
        to sit down for a little &quot;healing&quot; session. With sun streaming 
        through the late morning window, I lay back as the music stretched through 
        the lonely room. &quot;Blues is the healer/It healed me, it can heal you&#133;&quot; 
        sings Hooker. And later, in &quot;Rockin' Chair,&quot; &quot;I ain't gonna 
        be&#133;yo fool no more/I'm so tired, so tired baby, bein' yo slave night 
        and day/Sittin' here rockin', rockin', rockin', tryin' to rock these blues 
        away.&quot; </p>
      <p>As I study the ceiling and focus on the lyrics, Hooker softly mumbles 
        out his hurt. He is strong in his despair, but not angry. She's gone, 
        it hurts, enough said. She's giving me the blues, but &quot;that's alright, 
        baby/I know you done me wrong, baby/but that's alright.&quot; His greatness 
        is here; when wounded, he simply walks away, moving on, carrying his blues. 
        Wisdom comes with age, with experience, and Hooker gives an aura of sagacity 
        very few musicians can claim. Nothing fancy, he is simply honest with 
        his feelings, blunt about his losses. </p>
      <p><i>The Healer</i> is musically interesting and therapeutically powerful. 
        John Lee Hooker is a huge figure American in music, influencing Santana, 
        the Rolling Stones, Foghat, and nearly all blues artists of the last half-century. 
        An inductee in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Hooker does his legacy 
        justice here, powerfully asserting himself in spite of the dual nature 
        of most of the album. </p>
      <p>&quot;My songs are like poetry. Some are pretty heavy-so heavy I can 
        hardly carry them&#133;Sometimes on stage, when I'm singing them, it gets 
        so sad and deep and beautiful, I have to wear dark glasses to keep the 
        people from seeing me crying. I'm not kidding. The tears just start running. 
        With the words that I'm saying and the way I sing them, sometimes I give 
        my own self the blues.&quot; </p>
