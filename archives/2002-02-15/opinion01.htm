        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font></p>
      <p align="left">I think that this is an important time for Boston sports 
        fans. With a Super Bowl victory from their beloved Patriots still fresh 
        in mind and spring training just around the corner, Boston fans are faced 
        with the important task of developing a sense of humor. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The other night, I was having a few drinks with a some Boston 
        sports fans. We were reminiscing about the Super Bowl and discussing the 
        upcoming baseball season. Feeling a bit drunk and completely comfortable 
        I quipped, &quot;I hope you guys remember that field goal when Giambi 
        sends home run #55 over the right field fence. It will probably be a game-winner, 
        putting the Yankees up 11 games over the Red Sox in mid-August.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The mood turned sour. One of them started sobbing. Another 
        insulted my mother, then went to the bar, downed three shots of Jack Daniels, 
        and passed out. Another slapped me in the face. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was apparent to me that this most recent Super Bowl triumph 
        has not succeeded in loosening up Boston fans. They are still filled with 
        hatred, and it's unlikely that this will change anytime soon. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But why? Why are Boston fans so incapable of enjoying themselves 
        or a joke about their team? Why are they such hateful people?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The next morning I lay in bed contemplating the events of 
        the previous night, and I came to the following conclusion. Years of losing 
        at the hands of the Yankees have done serious damage to the mental state 
        of Red Sox fans of all generations. They are not lighthearted sports enthusiasts, 
        and clearly have no sense of humor with regard to their team. It is also 
        clear that no amount of success enjoyed by other Boston teams will mitigate 
        this. The Red Sox have to win. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I rolled over and continued to contemplate the complete 
        and utter indignation that Boston fans feel for the New York Yankees. 
        This hatred is interesting because it is decidedly one-sided. Yankees 
        fans like to beat the Red Sox, but we aren't consumed with this rivalry 
        the way the Red Sox fans are. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Much of this is largely due to the conception that the Yankees 
        buy championships. While this question is not as black and white as Red 
        Sox fans would like to think, it is indisputable that the Yankees have 
        more money then most franchises, enabling them to build teams in a way 
        that is not available to most teams. However, this is the not the fault 
        of the Yankees, and is instead a reflection of baseball's economics, which 
        are, interestingly enough, similar to the economics of American politics.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The most important misconception to shatter is that professional 
        sports are anything but entertainment. The games are real, but at the 
        end of the day, professional sports are about the fans who are willing 
        to pay big money to watch athletes perform. Owners pay players to play, 
        essentially making players the products and fans the consumers-with money 
        as the ultimate motivation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Football and baseball have developed markedly different 
        ways of dispensing their respective product. Football has adopted a salary 
        cap, and by limiting the amount of money for each team to spend, emphasis 
        has shifted to personnel decisions, coaching, and actual player performance. 
        The sport functions because fans in all 31 NFL cities love their teams 
        and have playoff hopes. The revenue from television contracts is shared, 
        removing any competitive advantage to playing in, say, New York versus 
        Cleveland. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This is not the case in baseball, a sport with no salary 
        cap and limited revenue sharing. There is no limit to how much a team 
        can spend on players-reflected in the escalating payroll of the Yankees.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Yankees also have the most lucrative television contract 
        in the league, basically indicating that there are more people who want 
        to watch, and are willing to pay to watch, Yankee games then there are 
        for Kansas City Royals, Pittsburgh Pirates, or Boston Red Sox games. This 
        means that advertisers will pay more for time, and so on.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The NFL has institutionalized equality with the hope that 
        rabid fans in each NFL city will provide economic health and competition 
        for the league. I happen to agree with this move.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Baseball has not institutionalized a good degree of competition, 
        however. Major league baseball has allowed the free market to run its 
        course, and only a handful of teams can afford to compete as a result. 
        There is a direct correlation between revenue and success-the more money 
        a team spends, the better it will be.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most baseball fans recognize that there is something fundamentally 
        wrong if a direct correlation between money and a team's ability to succeed 
        exists. However, why haven't more Americans, specifically fans from smaller, 
        money-deprived markets, spoken out about the influence of money in politics? 
        In politics, the money-power correlation is as direct as it is in baseball. 
        The cost of running for office is prohibitively high for many Americans 
        and limits access to public office. Then there is the fact that through 
        large soft-money contributions, corporations influence the political process. 
        Companies with more money have more influence. The correlation is clear. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back to baseball. Regardless of competitive disparities, 
        Boston Red Sox fans do need to lighten up and enjoy themselves a little. 
        When the Yankees start winning games again, they should remember their 
        heroic Patriots, have a glass of wine, and relax.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is these Red Sox fans that must champion the cause of 
        campaign finance reform. No one understands the competitive disparity 
        that money creates better then them, and hence it is those surly New Englanders 
        who must lead the crusade to purge politics of big-money influence. <br>
