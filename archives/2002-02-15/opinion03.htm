      <p align="left"><font size="5">Is intellectual discourse dead?</font><br>
        <font size="2">GENEVIVE CREEDON</font></p>
      <p align="left">The first unofficial thing I was told about Bowdoin was 
        that it is a &quot;first-grade camp for twenty-year-olds.&quot; Perhaps 
        the comment was supposed to be charming and certainly funny, but it also 
        implies that we are walking around with the mentality of first graders 
        in adult bodies. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There is probably nothing wrong with that reality, in moderation. 
        I'm certainly a proponent of getting in touch with one's &quot;inner child,&quot; 
        to put it in its clich&eacute;d phrasing. The matter, however, creates 
        what we might call a problem in intellectual dialogue on campus. The mission 
        of a college is, as far as I am concerned, to create an intellectual community 
        that facilitates and encourages the exchange of knowledge and ideas. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I will not doubt that Bowdoin houses a community of bel 
        esprits; I simply doubt that the community has gained strength in the 
        face of so-called first-grade &quot;campers.&quot; And that minor detail, 
        for me, is an issue. There is something wrong when one has to actively 
        and with no small effort seek to find-and then uphold-an intellectual 
        dialogue.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I know that I'm not the only one who acknowledges this somewhat 
        ironic lack of discourse. It is not, however, a mere matter of starting 
        up such discussion, because it will quickly fade and remain buried beneath 
        the careless and fruitless screams of its competition. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I will be criticized for my critical view and somewhat sharp 
        words, which is fine. Please, respond. Agree, disagree, talk, scream-do 
        something, because that's how it starts. Careless complacency can only 
        be the dominant atmosphere of a place for so long, but it will reign here 
        until more people act or speak to break it. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is cannot be enough to go to class, come back, and complain 
        about work. There was a Common Hour speaker last semester who lamented 
        that when she was in school, humanities majors carried on charged intellectual 
        debates, but no one wanted to hear about science classes. I remember hearing 
        those words and thinking, &quot;At least they had ongoing intellectual 
        exchanges.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sometimes I'm inclined to think that the era of that exchange 
        is simply dead. We're living in a different time that focuses less on 
        intellectual capacities and more on practicality and usefulness. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The potential to look beyond those points undoubtedly exists. 
        I see and hear it in my classes every day, but there seems to be an enormous 
        barrier between the classroom and the rest of life that really should 
        not persist. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I once told someone that I am happiest here when I am in 
        class. Though that statement has been challenged by a small group of people, 
        people who have not come here to go to camp, it still holds a lot of truth. 
        The response I got to the comment was, &quot;In a strange way, that is 
        a great tribute to Bowdoin.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And it is. The potential is enormous, and I'm fairly sure 
        that everyone who works here recognizes it and wants to bring it out. 
        But the kind efforts of the people here and the success of our complete 
        education is still left to our attitude, our willingness, and our desire.</p>
