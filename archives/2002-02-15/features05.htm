        <br>
        A few days after running into Raoul on Kurf&uuml;rstendamm I moved in 
        with him. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Pension Sh&eacute;ira was located on the top floor of a 
        massive turn of the century apartment building that somehow had escaped 
        Allied carpet bombing during the war.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">An ancient lift deposited one on the fifth floor directly 
        outside a large milk glass-paned door.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This led directly into a murky lounge filled with half a 
        dozen armchairs meant for guests, but also doubling as Madame's living 
        room. On the walls hung signed photographs of 1920s theatrical celebrities 
        such as Max Reinhardt and Marlene Dietrich, augmented by more recent ones 
        from the fifties.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another glass-paned door led into Madam's bedroom, resembling 
        an antique dealer's storeroom full of accumulated junk, and an enormous 
        double bed in the midst of it. This Madam apparently shared with a young 
        Moroccan she was said to have picked up on nocturnal wanderings in the 
        streets. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ahmed was what Germans call a Hausfreund, or live-in lover, 
        as well as general factotum. After preparing breakfast for guests, and 
        tidying their rooms, he would put his slippered feet up in the lounge 
        and spend the rest of the day watching television. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Late at night subdued giggles and sounds of splashing issuing 
        from the large bath adjacent to Madam's bedroom, used also by guests, 
        told their own story. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the end of a long and narrow corridor, off the lounge, 
        was the room Raoul occupied. The corner room was large and airy, with 
        balcony overlooking Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, unfortunately at a major intersection, 
        with traffic lights down below. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The noise of traffic, in particular of cars starting up 
        again when the lights changed, went on into the early hours of the morning. 
        Since there was no air-conditioning, and windows had to be kept open in 
        the mid-August heat, one didn't get much sleep. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Not that we really minded.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">During daytime rehearsals at the Kunstakademie I took photos 
        of scenery and actors with an old Leica Nellie had given me. In the evenings 
        we would usually eat at a Ku-damm restaurant called The Drugstore, like 
        one on the Champs Elys&eacute;es. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For late-night snacks we went across the road to a hot-dog 
        stand selling the ever-popular and strongly flavored Curry-Wurst. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Every time Raoul spotted a girl in a mini-skirt, the latest 
        craze, he would yell Mini-Rock! at the top of his voice. Shoulder-length 
        hair, as worn by two Dutch boys having attached themselves the Living 
        Theater, was something not seen before either, and just as scandalous 
        to some. One of them, with angelic face framed by long straight hair, 
        looked like Jesus.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Back at Madam Sh&eacute;ira's actors and groupies would 
        gather in Raoul's room. Someone would roll a joint and pass it round. 
        Raoul preferred hashish. After taking a few quick drags from a small pipe, 
        sucking in air like a man drowning, he would hand it to me. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unfortunately smoking pot, and in particular hashish, for 
        me had unpleasant side effects. Slinking off to some corner I would watch 
        the others talking and laughing, about me I thought. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What about my filmmaking? Rather than joining the Film Institute, 
        as planned, I decided to get a 16-mm camera and start filming right away. 
        <br>
        Having acquired a second-hand Bolex I set off for East Berlin to film 
        the Olympic Stadium in which Hitler had staged the Olympic Games of 1936, 
        famously filmed by Leni Riefenstahl, still alive and unrepentant. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was here that Jesse Owens had won the hundred meters, 
        setting a new world record. But Hitler refused to shake his hand because 
        Owens happened to be black.. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Waiting to cross into Communist East Berlin at check-point 
        Friedrichstra&szlig;e, an underground and railway station in the center, 
        I surrendered my passport to be inspected in some office. Suddenly I heard 
        my name called, and an official came over to pull me out of the queue 
        of other West Germans. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I was afraid they were going to question me, on account 
        of the Bolex. <br>
        Far from it. I was to be given preferential treatment it seemed. The U.S. 
        immigration visa in my passport showed Carmel, California, as my permanent 
        address, so they decided to treat me as a foreigner. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Silly though it seems, this stratagem was employed by the 
        East Berlin authorities to emphasize that East Germany was a proper state, 
        something the government at Bonn and its western allies strenuously denied. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Have fun filming,&quot; the official handing my passport 
        back said with a smile. <br>
        Another time I went with Julian Beck and Judith Malina, founders and directors 
        of the Living Theater, to East Berlin's Brecht Theater to see Mother Courage, 
        with Helene Weigel, the late playwright's wife, in the title role. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Judith, the daughter of a Rabbi who'd escaped the Nazis, 
        was born in Germany she told me. But, she laughed, she'd had her 'Jewish 
        nose' fixed anyway, by plastic surgery. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Though married to Julian, who was gay, Judith had taken 
        one of the boys in the company, conveniently lodged next-door, for a lover. 
        I don't think Julian really minded. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for Raoul and me, the revived affair was of short duration. 
        One day a cute blond kid Raoul had met in Munich turned up. Henceforth 
        Wolfgang shared our bed, fortunately big enough. Such were the trials 
        and tribulations of a groupie. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I put up with them only because desperate to join the Living 
        Theater. However shortly before Christmas they left, for Italy, without 
        me. <br>
        Small consolation though it was, Raoul left me a supply of pot. I shared 
        it with Wolfi, equally disappointed at being left behind.</p>
