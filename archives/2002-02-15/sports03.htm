      <p align="left">Well, sports fans, this week's 4-1 loss to Colby is a tough 
        one to recap, because it was one that got away in aggravating fashion. 
        Head coach Terry Meagher made that quite clear in his remarks after the 
        game: &quot;We wanted to play the game to a high standard, and to lose 
        it in front of the people who support us was very frustrating,&quot; he 
        said.<br>
      </p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">&quot;We came at them hard from the first drop of the puck 
        and scored within the first couple of minutes; that's something you always 
        want to do,&quot; senior Dave Rush said. &quot;It got the fans all fired 
        up-they were awesome, as always, throughout the game.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The lively Polar Bear crowd was indeed raring to go, fueled 
        in the first period when first year Shannon McNevan scored at 1:42. &quot;I 
        thought that we played great in the first ten minutes,&quot; Meagher said. 
        &quot;We had our team, the team that's been there for most of the year.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Mike Carosi agreed. &quot;I thought we came out very 
        strong,&quot; he said.<br>
        Forty-six ticks into the second period, the first of two goals from Colby's 
        Bobby Nagle brought the Mules to a 1-1 tie. It was downhill for the Bears 
        from there, resulting from a number of penalties and lack of momentum, 
        according to several. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We took some penalties that changed the momentum of 
        the game (in Colby's favor),&quot; Carosi said. &quot;We were forced to 
        kill too many.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We were able to hold them scoreless in the first period, 
        even through their considerable amount of power play time,&quot; Rush 
        said. &quot;As it went on, we took a number of penalties and the momentum 
        shifted. It gave [the Mules] confidence and they built on it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that with a lot of starters on the bench, it 
        was difficult for the Bears (16-2-3, 13-1-3 NESCAC) to mount much opposition. 
        &quot;We couldn't get any rhythm; any flow; and that carried over when 
        we had a power play opportunity,&quot; he said. &quot;They were playing 
        their most skilled players, and that made it even more difficult.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As they entered the second period, Rush said the men were 
        looking to play even-strength hockey and stay out of the penalty box. 
        &quot;We played them straight up for the remainder of the second,&quot; 
        he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The approach didn't hold for the men into the final period, 
        however. Colby's James LaLiberty broke the tie at 1:41 on a breakaway, 
        and was followed by Evan Kearns, who netted another White Mule goal six 
        minutes later. &quot;Colby got a couple of bounces and was able to find 
        the back of the net twice,&quot; Rush said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears seemed to lose defensive steam as the night wore 
        on. &quot;We have not done a good job in our down-low defensive zone in 
        both our home games this year,&quot; Meagher said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More important, according to him, is the work needed on 
        team order. &quot;Our lack of discipline and taking extra penalties are 
        not a good reflection of the school,&quot; he said. &quot;Having it occur 
        at this point in the year is frustrating. We cannot be an undisciplined 
        team.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meagher said that upperclassmen are playing an important 
        role in the process. &quot;The senior class is so focused and has such 
        a high standard in conducting itself,&quot; he said. 'They've taken a 
        very strong lead in this.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men split last weekend, earning a 7-3 win at the University 
        of Southern Maine on February 8 and taking the season's only loss thus 
        far at Salem State. According to Meagher, some of the problems that plagued 
        the Bears against Colby (13-5-3, 10-5-3) were evident in those games, 
        too. &quot;I think some of the same issues occurred on Friday-the lack 
        of discipline, but we got through it,&quot; he said. &quot;It's been creeping 
        in for the last couple of games.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">He added that the work of Salem goaltender Kaleb Christensen, 
        who stopped 42 shots that night, factored largely in the Bears' first 
        loss. &quot;He was outstanding; it was one of the best performances I've 
        seen against us this,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears, second in NESCAC standings to Middlebury (21-1-1, 
        17-0-1) are gearing up for a busy weekend and are putting the week's disappointments 
        behind them. Meagher said that the men were &quot;focusing on where we 
        are as a team this week,&quot; and would be taking it one game at a time.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The first such matchup is tonight, at home against Amherst 
        (6-11-5, 6-74). The third-place Ephs from Williams visit tomorrow at 4:00 
        p.m. for the last game of the regular season.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rush said that the weekend is a chance for the Bears to 
        redeem themselves. &quot;We have to get things rolling for the playoffs,&quot; 
        he said. &quot;We're going into it with our heads up and are looking to 
        it as a fresh start.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Carosi echoed his teammate's sentiments. &quot;This weekend, 
        we'll be looking to stay disciplined, stay out of the penalty box, and 
        outwork our opponents,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears have earned home-ice advantage for next weekend's 
        first-round playoff game against an undetermined opponent. They face off 
        with the Jeffs at 7:00 p.m. tonight.</p>
