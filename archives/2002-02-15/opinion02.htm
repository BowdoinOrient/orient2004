      <p align="left"><font size="5">Subscribing to a culture of materialism</font><br>
        <font size="2">EBEN GILFENBAUM</font></p>
      <p>I recently found myself weaving through the library's first-floor periodical 
        section in my never-ending attempt to feel productive while procrastinating. 
        Two magazines caught my eye as rather strange additions to Bowdoin's subscription 
        list. The first was New York, a magazine with a cover displaying half 
        a dozen multi-racial, upwardly mobile young professionals in a semicircle 
        looking up into the camera with grave concern. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The headline read, &quot;The Big Chill: New Yorkers Learn to Live with 
        Less.&quot; A caption was placed beside each person indicating what he 
        or she had given up in recent months. My two favorites were &quot;Just 
        ate his last $16 appetizer&quot; and &quot;Giving up her trainer, but 
        can she live without her shrink?&quot; <br>
        Not only is the cover a stark, if not comical, portrait of how the notion 
        of sacrifice has been constructed in this time of war and recession, but 
        also is demonstrative of the subject matter with which the magazine is 
        concerned.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Continuing down the aisle, I discovered Yachting-a magazine entirely 
        devoted to multi-million dollar yachts and the many exotic and wonderful 
        places where you can sail them. Not quite ready to return to my reading, 
        I reached the end of the alphabet and found myself with some unanswered 
        questions about why the library would subscribe to such vapid crap that 
        so shamelessly promotes excessive material wealth.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Descending to the basement in hopes that the magazines' back issues would 
        reveal the answer, I discovered that the library has subscribed to New 
        York since 1968, and Yachting since 1948. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If the magazines are vestiges of a time when Bowdoin was a thriving chapter 
        of the good-old-boys club, what were they still doing populating the shelves 
        of a College revitalized by 30 years of reform? <br>
      </p>
      <p>The answer is an obvious but important one. While the era of white male 
        privilege may have been glossed over by a new period of socioeconomic, 
        gender, and racial sensitivity at Bowdoin, the magazines' endurance is 
        tangible proof that the same lifestyle expectations of that time remain 
        an undercurrent of Bowdoin's culture today. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although students are fond of saying that success is not measured in 
        dollars and cents, these magazines suggest that there is more tension 
        in that common understanding than we often like to admit. <br>
      </p>
      <p>They represent a college culture where deciding to live a simple life, 
        with a simple occupation and simple comforts, is laden with a certain 
        amount of guilt for not living up to the potential Bowdoin has provided-that 
        you have somehow betrayed the institution, and even worse, yourself by 
        choosing a life where cruising into New York on your 150-foot yacht is 
        not an option. I realize that I may be overstating the point, but on some 
        level these types of feelings operate for each of us.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As Bowdoin continues to attempt to transcend the baggage of its past 
        and create a new cultural landscape, ending its subscription to these 
        magazines would be a useful step in that larger process. </p>
