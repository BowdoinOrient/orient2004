      <p align="left">Bob Powell, last Thursday's Bowdoin Outing Club speaker 
        described the chronic lodging dilemma faced by himself and two companions 
        on their 50-day sea kayaking expedition in 1996 to South Georgia Island, 
        in the South Atlantic Ocean.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Inspired by Ernest Shackleton's 1914 odyssey on the boat, 
        Endurance, the three raft guiding buddies embarked on their expedition 
        to a place about which they had read few accounts. &quot;We didn't know 
        what huge meant. Strong winds? What does that mean?&quot; Powell's slides 
        showed the kayakers floating on steely blue water set against a background 
        that looked like a postcard of the Teton wilderness. Snow-covered mountains 
        behind the vast, freezing waters provided a daunting welcome to the modern 
        adventurers with their plastic boats, dry suits, and 50 days worth of 
        beef jerky. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When Powell checked in with authorities, they greeted him, 
        saying, &quot;We don't have a boat, we're not gonna be able to come get 
        you.&quot; This sobering realization at the outset of their trip made 
        the echo of Shackleton's journey as potent, exciting, and intimidating 
        as the blue glaciers welling up behind the white-capped water. They began 
        their journey by loading 500 pounds of gear into three sea kayaks and 
        &quot;paddling away like we knew what we were doing.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Six-foot-seven and sinewy, with legs dwarfing the Bowdoin 
        podium and hands like my sea-faring grandfather, Powell addressed an audience 
        thirsty for an adventure story. And, he seemed to have an infinite number 
        of tales to tell. Between 1992 and 1996, Powell claimed many honors in 
        the sport of kayaking. Paddling partner and friend, Mike Woodruff pitched 
        Powell's adventure with enthusiasm, &quot;1996: It was a good year in 
        the paddling world and in the life of Bob Powell, the wanderer.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a member of the U.S. National Team, Powell earned the 
        number one spot as a C-1 (closed canoe) paddler in wild water competitions. 
        He competed in the World Championships and World Cup, placing among the 
        top ten boats of the Cup multiple years in a row. His whitewater accolades, 
        however, were not part of the evening's program. From under his blondish 
        mustache came the sounds of growls, burps, claps, farts, and roars as 
        he coupled wildlife slides with homemade surround sound. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While the pictures told much of his experience surfing waves, 
        sledding his kayak down an icy slope to the water's edge, and paddling 
        in almost continual light, it was the words of the dungareed man that 
        sent the giggling audience into awed whispers and back to hooting as he 
        described going on a &quot;SWAT mission&quot; looking for campsites amid 
        piles of mud-saturated seals claiming their spaces on the limited shoreline.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The men got what they sought on their of Shackletonesque 
        voyage, as they put themselves at the mercy of the sunshine, wind, hail, 
        waves, and fog in their small plastic vessels. One day of the trip, there 
        were 100 mph winds on the beach where the three men were camped. Their 
        tent exploded and they all lay down &quot;spread eagle,&quot; on their 
        gear. Powell makes a whizzing sound to describe the cat-sized object that 
        zipped past his head. It was an &quot;Antarctic bowling ball,&quot; he 
        informs us. The audience waits for the explanation, smiling. &quot;Adult 
        Penguins make a run for the grass to get back to their babies in between 
        gusts.&quot; When the wind comes again, they face plant their bills into 
        the sand, flattening out on their bellies, only to be blown, tumbling 
        past the heads of their fellow islanders, whizzing, back into the water.<br>
        <br>
        Partway through the trip, the trio decided to re-route and traverse the 
        land, Shackleton's Gap, deviating from their original plan to circumnavigate 
        the whole of South Georgia Island. According to Powell, this &quot;change 
        of heart&quot; forced the men to re-identify their trip goals. They wanted 
        to &quot;explore more, go into every fjord&#133;learn a lot about South 
        Georgia Island.&quot; They visited Shackleton's grave, stayed at scientific 
        stations, explored the rusty ruins of old whaling operations, took time 
        to hike the rocky coastal hills that flanked their campsites, learned 
        about the history of the island, and observed its wild inhabitants. Anticipating 
        an untouched wilderness, Powell regretfully informed his listeners that 
        &quot;every day I saw the impact of man: trash; rope, strangling fur seals.&quot; 
        He reminded us that people are still affecting even the most isolated 
        places, like this island, this &quot;dot in the middle of the ocean.&quot; 
        Powell also took this time to render an &quot;artist's interpretation&quot; 
        of their experience through watercolors. &quot;Our new goals made all 
        the difference in the world to us,&quot; he explained thoughtfully. &quot;We 
        were getting more knowledgeable and more relaxed.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite its isolation, South Georgia Island is a vital breeding 
        sanctuary for a heavy concentration of wildlife. Millions of southern 
        fur and elephant seals come to the island to breed. An equal number of 
        penguins make the island their home; sometimes entire hillsides are covered 
        with their nests. And Powell's slides show this. He shows pictures of 
        Gentoo, Adelie and Chinstrap penguins by the hundreds; Wandering Albatross, 
        Grant's Petrels; leopard, elephant, and fur seals. On the rockier snow 
        hills, he photographed members of the two remaining populations of reindeer 
        brought in by early whalers. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now a full time graduate student at Yale University, Powell 
        plans to incorporate his recent studies and adventures into learning and 
        teaching more about Antarctica. He hopes to conduct a study on how nature-based 
        tourism impacts the values, behaviors, and knowledge of people. According 
        to Powell, no one has ever tried to measure this. Powell ended his account 
        explaining that an adventure was &quot;something that pushes your abilities 
        and the outcome isn't guaranteed. He proposed that anybody could do these 
        types of trips. &quot;The natural world offers an opportunity to test 
        the self mentally and physically,&quot; pausing before adding, &quot;and 
        to connect aesthetically and spiritually.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Steady-eyed, with forearms tanned and muscled from years 
        of boating, Powell tells me that there's something nice about expeditions, 
        something different than just day trips. Serving as Director of Adventure 
        Travel at the Nantahala Outdoor Center in North Carolina for seven years, 
        Powell has had experience leading trips to various parts of the world. 
        His geographic guiding history claims venues in countries such as Australia, 
        New Zealand, Nepal, China, Fiji, Chile, Turkey, Greece, and Guadeloupe. 
        &quot;[Trip leading] teaches you leadership, trip planning, and coping 
        with the fact that you can apply to all aspects of your life.&quot; And 
        Powell certainly lives this doctrine, as he continues to delight us with 
        his stories.<br>
