      <p align="left">To The Editors:</p>
      <p>The V-Day Bowdoin College Committee is writing to encourage the community 
        to help stop violence against women and buy tickets for Eve Ensler's <i>The 
        Vagina Monologues</i> (<i>TVM</i>). Ensler's Obie Award-winning play is 
        the centerpiece of the V-Day Movement-a global effort to end violence 
        against women and girls. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin is fortunate to be part of The V-Day College Campaign, which 
        has over 550 colleges around the world participating after only three 
        years.<br>
        In purchasing a ticket for <i>TVM</i>, you are contributing to Sexual 
        Assault Support Services of Midcoast Maine (SASSMM), which provides an 
        invaluable service to Bowdoin and the region. SASSMM offers 24-hour support 
        for victims of sexual assault. In addition, it holds support group meetings 
        and works with local high schools for sexual assault risk reduction and 
        prevention. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Ten percent of proceeds will go to the Revolutionary Association of Women 
        of Afghanistan (RAWA). This grassroots organization of Afghani women is 
        helping to rebuild a war-torn country as a safe place for its women and 
        girls. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to supporting these causes, purchasing a ticket to <i>TVM</i> 
        is a show of support and respect for all women of the world, especially 
        those who have been brutalized. We strongly encourage the men of the Bowdoin 
        and Brunswick communities to take this opportunity to hear women's stories 
        and celebrate their womanhood. Men often feel excluded from the V-Day 
        movement, but while V-Day is about women, we assert that our efforts to 
        end violence are only possible with the help and support of our male family 
        members, friends, and lovers.<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>TVM</i> is a funny, heartbreaking, and at times outrageous performance 
        piece. Although seemingly controversial, Ensler's and V-Day's missions 
        are simple: to use creative methods to stop violence against women and 
        girls and create a more peaceful world. We encourage all those who attend 
        to live in the sometimes-uncomfortable space that <i>TVM</i> can create 
        and to use its complicated power and energy as a catalyst for necessary 
        and positive change.<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>The Vagina Monologues</i> will be performed in Kresge Auditorium on 
        February 21, 22, and 23. Tickets are $5 for students and $7 for the public 
        and can be purchased at the Smith Union Information Desk.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>The seriousness of sign theft</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In a recent issue of the Orient, there was an article on stolen road 
        signs. Bruce Boucher and the Deans need to emphasize the seriousness of 
        stealing signs, particularly stop signs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A number of years ago, maybe 20, a student took the stop sign at the 
        corner of Coffin Street and Longfellow Avenue on the way to Pickard Field. 
        A young woman and her small child, new to the area, drove into the intersection 
        from Coffin Street without stopping. The car was broadsided. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I do not know the extent of their injuries, but I think that a Bowdoin 
        student was at least suspected, if not charged.</p>
      <p>E.O. LaCasce<br>
        Professor Emeritus</p>
      <p><font size="5"><a name="3"></a>Rubio clarifies Jung lecture review</font></p>
      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In the February 1 edition of the Orient, Hannah Dean wrote a review of 
        my lecture entitled &quot;Weaving Our Vessels: Wood, Wool and the Weird 
        Sisters&quot; that was given at the Bowdoin Jung Seminars. While I'm delighted 
        that Ms. Dean attended the presentation and shared her perceptions, there 
        are a few clarifications and enlargements that I would like to make.<br>
      </p>
      <p>First was the description of the audience. It is fortunate that a deep 
        and abiding sense of humor seems to be a prerequisite for graceful aging/saging. 
        Ms. Dean likened the audience members to a &quot;flock of delicate birds 
        with hollow bones&#133;who seemed to be seeking out some kind of comfort&#133;.&quot;<br>
        Since many of us love to tease and jest, these descriptions shall probably 
        enjoy a mirthful longevity. However, I would like to offer a different 
        perspective.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Although I don't know them all individually, it is my impression that 
        participants in the seminar are capable, full-bodied individuals who have 
        led and continue to lead deep and full lives. Filled with a lively curiosity, 
        they gracefully give and receive without pretense. I treasure many of 
        their kind offerings. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Second were the quotations. During my presentation, I quoted several 
        authors. Somehow, in these quotations' travels from the Beam Classroom 
        to the Orient, the words became detached from their creators. To give 
        credit where credit is due, the following quotes are reunited with their 
        respective owners:<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?&quot;-Omar Khayyam<br>
        <br>
        &quot;The greatest things in life can't be spoken of at all. The best 
        we can do is point to those things by using metaphor and symbol to indicate 
        the center of the whorl.&quot; -Paraphrase of Joseph Campbell</p>
      <p>&quot;What's fitting in the morning of one's life, may not be fitting 
        in the afternoon.&quot; -Paraphrase of Carl Jung</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most significant clarification surrounds Ms. Dean's concluding 
        summary of my presentation. Something did not connect here. <br>
        While I certainly think that our thoughts, actions and ways of being in 
        the world, both individually and as a society, INFLUENCE our destiny, 
        by no means did I intend to imply that they were the totality. &quot;East 
        of the Sun, West of the Moon&quot; (better known as the Greek story of 
        Eros and Psyche), the Weird Sisters (Norns, Morai) and the symbolism of 
        the various phases of the wool all encompassed the idea that there are 
        other mysteries afoot which deepen, enrich and alter the courses of our 
        lives.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Again, I would like to thank Hannah Dean for prompting more discussion 
        of a very ancient and vibrant story. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There are still several intriguing presentations scheduled before the 
        winter season comes to a close on March 12. The Bowdoin College Jung Seminar 
        extends a warm welcome to anyone who may be interested.</p>
