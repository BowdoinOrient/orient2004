        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: I have a friend who gets stoned a lot. 
        What's he doing to his brain? I know he's not doing very well academically. 
        T.F.</i></p>
      <p>Dear T.F.: An increasing body of research suggests that marijuana is 
        neither the deadly toxin its foes portray, nor the benign herb its advocates 
        promote. Heavy, regular use of marijuana may be more harmful and habit-forming 
        than previously suspected.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The principal active ingredient in marijuana is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol 
        - THC. Researchers have discovered THC-binding receptors throughout the 
        body and brain, and naturally occurring, THC-like endogenous cannabinoids, 
        or endocannabinoids, which bind to these receptors. Endocannabinoids appear 
        to play an important role in regulating mood, appetite, pain, memory, 
        and a variety of other sensations and functions. <br>
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/features01_doobie.jpg" width="200" height="97" align="right">Current 
        research into these mechanisms is in part driven by the debate over medical 
        marijuana use. For many people with AIDS, cancer and other debilitating 
        diseases, marijuana offers substantial relief from pain, nausea and loss 
        of appetite. Chronic marijuana use, however, may possibly have harmful 
        effects as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p>THC seems to change the way in which sensory information is processed 
        by the hippocampus, the part of our brains' limbic system which integrates 
        sensory inputs with emotions and motivations, all components of memory 
        formation and learning. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Longitudinal studies of high school students who smoke marijuana regularly, 
        do show lower academic achievement and greater behavioral problems. Of 
        course, it may be a little tricky here to sort out cause and effect. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A much-touted study of college students is reported to show that critical 
        skills relating to attention, memory and learning are all impaired in 
        people who use marijuana heavily. Researchers compared a large group of 
        students who smoked marijuana daily, to a &quot;matched&quot; group of 
        students who smoked less than once a month, if ever. They were all closely 
        monitored for a nineteen to twenty-four hour abstinence period, and then 
        administered a battery of standardized tests. The pot smokers scored more 
        poorly on measures of attention, memory and new learning. It is unclear 
        whether any of these effects might be long lasting.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This study might have several important flaws, especially around issues 
        of matching and THC &quot;washout.&quot; Whatever the shortcomings of 
        research, it seems clear enough to me, for pretty obvious reasons, that 
        getting stoned every day is likely to have a deleterious impact on one's 
        academic performance. There may also be other health consequences to consider. 
        <br>
        Heavy marijuana use is definitely associated with depressed libido, lower 
        sperm counts and occasional breast enlargement in men, as well as with 
        irregular menstrual cycles in women. Marijuana smoke contains more tar 
        than tobacco smoke, and may be even more damaging to lung tissues. Daily 
        users have more respiratory problems and more injuries from accidents. 
        Smoking pot elevates your blood pressure, raises your heart rate (as much 
        as 50 percent in the first hour), and has been shown to increase some 
        people's risk of heart attack up to five-fold.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The question of marijuana's addictive potential is quite contentious. 
        More than seventy-two million Americans have smoked marijuana at least 
        once, and it remains the most commonly and casually used illicit substance 
        across the nation. Many commentators point out that currently available 
        marijuana is very much more potent than it used to be, and so is more 
        likely to become abused. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports 
        that more than 120,000 people enter treatment each year for their primary 
        marijuana addiction. <br>
      </p>
      <p>NIDA categorizes a drug as addicting &quot;if it causes compulsive, at 
        times uncontrollable drug craving, seeking and use, even in the face of 
        negative health and social consequences,&quot; and argues that marijuana 
        meets this criterion. Other researchers believe that a smaller segment 
        of the population, in the ten to fifteen percent range, are in some manner 
        vulnerable, and can become strongly dependent on marijuana. They may develop 
        cravings for the drug, and develop tolerance, needing to smoke more of 
        it to get the same effect. When they stop using marijuana regularly, they 
        may develop withdrawal symptoms that last for weeks, such as reactive 
        depression, anxiety, anger, insomnia or nausea. All of these features 
        are considered characteristic of addictions. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If you have questions or concerns about marijuana use, you can always 
        contact the Health Center or the Counseling Service. The Addictions Resource 
        Center in Bath would be an excellent off-campus alternative. And there 
        are many web-based sources of information, including <a href="HTTP://www.nida.nih.gov/NIDAHome.html">NIDA</a>

      </p>
      <p>Stay informed, and take good care of yourselves!<br>
