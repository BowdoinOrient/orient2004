        <font size="2">ETHAN BULLARD<br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">.....It all began on a blustery September day back in 1999. 
        Like a magnetic force, three musicians gravitated to each other with a 
        sense of pre-destined musical chemistry. Drummer Ethan &quot;P-Nutt&quot; 
        Bullard '03, guitarist/ubermusician Chris &quot;Banjo&quot; Bail '02, 
        and guitarist Andy &quot;I'm not Jewish, I'm Italian&quot; Rossi first 
        consummated in musical matrimony in a Gibson practice room. The power-trio 
        then added stalwart session bassist/French-Canadian hockey dynamo Julien 
        &quot;this sucks&quot; Breau to round out the maturing project. Inspired 
        by a once-legendary German techno-pop experiment, the emerging Bullard, 
        Bail, Rossi, and Breau quartet adopted the name &quot;Autobahn.&quot; 
        The 'Bahn, (as its known to the fans) explored (and exploited) many dimensions 
        of the Bowdoin music scene. Struggling to find its niche in a confused 
        world comprised of children of the 80s and followers of blues, rock, jazz, 
        reggae, AND Raga, Autobahn was fueled by the inspirations of U2, Radiohead, 
        the Beatles, the Police, the Bob's, and Tiny Tim. </p>
      <p align="left">Whether experiencing Autobahn in the opium dens of the Mothership, 
        the raucous keg-fueled parties of social houses, or the immense Bear Aids 
        festivals, BahnHeads followed the band for its diversity and deafening 
        guitar solos from Chris Bail. While the fans enjoyed the Bahn's musical 
        and ethnic diversity, the hodge-podge arrangements bothered co-founders 
        Bail and Bullard. By the spring of 2000, as Autobahn crossed the threshold 
        of a new century, it began refining its style to a more rock-oriented 
        direction. </p>
      <p align="left">Due to undisclosed conflicts, Autobahn ousted bassist Breau 
        and adopted the hottest new bass sensation on the campus, Freshman Colin 
        &quot;T-Bone&quot; Thibadeau '03. Touring the rest of spring 2000, the 
        Bahn concluded with a memorable Bear Aids performance opening for Ween. 
        The band took a hiatus in the fall of 2000 after Rossi graduated and Bail 
        was extradited to Switzerland. When he returned in 2001, Autobahn finally 
        had the rejuvenated energy to seize the Bowdoin scene. Joining the line-up 
        this time were rhythm guitarist/smut-peddler Dan &quot;iel&quot; Buckley 
        '02 and vocalist &quot;Sexy&quot; Sarah Ramey '03. Ramey provided the 
        band with a sense of matured sexual expression in what had traditionally 
        been a band of four male jerk-offs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Spring 2001 proved to be the Bahn's most successful and 
        rewarding season in the band's three year tenure. While crafting originals, 
        Autobahn also added new rock favorites to the live repertoire. Crowd pleasers 
        like Gun's and Roses &quot;Sweet Child of Mine&quot; Led Zep's &quot;Good 
        Times Bad Times&quot; and the bluegrass-inspired &quot;Angel from Montgonmery&quot; 
        by John Prine became the new classics in 'Bahn covers. In Spring 2001, 
        Autobahn also began experimenting with Communist rhetoric and regalia. 
        Heralded as &quot;the People's Party&quot; Autobahn unleashed its Red 
        Menace at Bowdoin's own House of Red, Helmriech. In April, Autobahn took 
        Marxism to Colby college in what is the most infamous of 'Bahn experiences. 
        Autobahn and its twenty closest superfans piled into a U-Haul for the 
        &quot;Debauchery on Wheels&quot; tour, bringing music and mayhem to our 
        neighbors in the north.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bullard, Bail, Buckley, Thibadeau, and Ramey concluded spring 
        2001 as they had one year previous, with a gripping performance at Bear 
        Aids. <br>
        In the fall of 2001 the band took its second hiatus as sophomore members 
        Ethan, Colin, and Sarah took time away to &quot;study&quot; in Alaska, 
        Turkey, and Italy, respectively. Returning to Maine in Mid January the 
        once again refreshed Autobahn began rehearsals for its newest project, 
        its first professional CD. The band will begin recording in February with 
        plans of 6-song EP to be released in late March. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Spanning two millennia, Autobahn has finally polished its 
        sound and found its distinguishing niche. Autobahn's strength comes not 
        only from the devotion of its members, but also the infrastructure provide 
        by seniors computer artist Ned Bair, video artist/roady Brendan Smith-Elion, 
        and security team leader, Mike Warner. Friday's show at Ladd house proved 
        that Autobahn exhibits a sense of musical maturity, deep, penetrating 
        self-expression, and yes...ear bleeding guitar solos from Chris Bail. 
        Stay tuned for more gigs this spring with a repeated tour-de-force of 
        Colby, Bates, and Vassar, plus an intimate CD release party at Jack McGee's 
        pub. <br>
        (and ladies, Ethan Bullard IS available, still) </p>
