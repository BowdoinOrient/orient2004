        <font size="2">SARAH RAMEY</font></p>
      <p align="left">The agony, the pain, the bitterness, the moping that occurs 
        on Valentine's Day, very simply, must go. I would like to motion for the 
        campus to just buck-up and quit its wallowing. And I don't say this as 
        one of the Snoopy card-sending, red heart antennae-wearing fanatics, but 
        rather as someone who has wallowed for too long and would like to see 
        the suffering put to an end. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This year, I don't intend to dissect the nuance of what 
        exactly is wrong with the Bowdoin dating scene, but rather just to recall 
        the moments of total absurdity in my own ridiculous love life. The one 
        story that comes to mind is one that has gone too long untold&#133;but 
        the time has finally come.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">*****<br>
        To preface, I find that nothing is more gut-wrenchingly uncomfortable 
        than the dreaded In-Car-Kiss. You pull up at the end of what otherwise 
        had been a perfectly enjoyable date, and then all of a sudden pleasant 
        conversation takes a turn for the horrendous&#133;stuttering, stammering, 
        the brief eye contact, the laughter to fill the void, the lean-in, the 
        seat belts, the stick-shift, and then in my case the inevitable and abrupt 
        &quot;Well, had a great time, see ya!&quot; and then the full-on sprint 
        from the car to my building, leaving behind my poor, puzzled date. But 
        for once in my life, I am not just being bizarre with no cause&#133;oh 
        no, there is a history behind this phobia&#133;a memory I've tried and 
        tried to bury, but will simply never lay itself to rest&#133;<br>
        The year: 1996. The place: Washington DC. The stage in my life: Awkward 
        to the Extreme.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The phone rings, and it's a boy. We'll call him Hank, for 
        the sake of privacy. So, Heinous Hank, as I took to calling him in the 
        aftermath of this horrid debacle, calls me up and asks if I'd like to 
        join him and his friends at the movies. Not being accustomed to being 
        asked out, and also admittedly naive, I agree, thinking that this will 
        be a fun get-together amongst friends. I should have noted the deceit 
        in his voice. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, excited to go see this movie with these older guys, 
        I drive down, feeling cool.I check my make-up in the rearview, flip my 
        hair upside down, ruffle it around a bit, flip it right side up again, 
        pinch my cheeks, make one last &quot;sexy&quot; pucker face in the mirror 
        and I am so ready for this group date.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now, before we go any further, let's take a minute to describe 
        Heinous Hank. Fun? No&#133;no&#133;maybe the&#133;opposite of fun. Interesting? 
        No&#133;not that either. And, I won't say that he was a midget&#133;or 
        a dwarf&#133;but I guess I can say we didn't exactly see eye to eye. And 
        I shouldn't say that he looked as if he hadn't been fed for the entire 
        month of June, but I'll be honest-I probably outweighed the kid by at 
        least 20 pounds.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So if you're thinking emaciated midget, with no redeeming 
        personality traits, you're right on track. Now that you have a frame of 
        reference, back to the date:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I arrive, and there he is, our famished little hobbit standing 
        in all his bespectacled glory next to the ticket counter, however rather 
        than flanked by his group of friends&#133;he is alone. All alone. Smiling 
        at me&#133;and at the corners of his mouth I can see what I could not 
        hear on the phone&#133;deceit.<br>
        Uncomfortably, I force a smile and begin the obligatory:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;What's up?&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Nothing, what's up with you?&quot; in a voice that 
        suggested that he preferred to speak out of his nose.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Oh&#133;nothing,&quot; I sighed. Then&#133; &quot;Where 
        are your friends&#133;you dirty, dirty liar?&quot; (italics here indicate 
        unspoken but heartfelt thoughts).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Oh&#133;they couldn't make it&#133;and now I have 
        you trapped exactly where I want you, Sarah Ramey&#133;.there is no escape!!&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now, we can actually just fast-forward through the next 
        portion of the night&#133;just picture me, Gigantor and he, Webster, trying 
        to negotiate our way through three hours of subtitles and a plot line 
        that, if I remember correctly, detailed the life and times of the 14th 
        Dalai Lama.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So we watch the Lama movie, and when it's over I announce 
        that it is far past my curfew and I must be returning home immediately-to 
        which he counters with an offer to walk me to my car. Seeing no way around 
        it, I reluctantly agree, eyes narrowed, but when we get there I manage 
        to breezily thank him and escape into my car&#133;astonished at my graceful 
        avoidance of end-of-date awkwardness. Smiling, I begin to drive away when-<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Tap tap tap!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Is he tapping on my window? Huh, indeed he is. Indeed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I look to the right to see Hank, whose head barely clears 
        the window at all, frantically making the roll down your window gesture. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Slowly, painfully, I roll down the window, which he immediately 
        reaches into, unlocks the door, opens the door, sits in the seat, closes 
        the door, puts on the seat belt, turns to me and says &quot;Can you give 
        me a ride to my car?&quot;<br>
        Left without a choice, I turn out of the parking lot and we go one block, 
        at which point he says &quot;OK&#133;, well, here we are. Thanks for the 
        ride.&quot; Pause. Sickening pause. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Then, &quot;Sarah, I had a great time tonight and I&#133;&quot; 
        Perhaps at this point he was trying to gaze meaningfully into my eyes, 
        however having turned myself squarely towards my own window, I have no 
        idea.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Well, see ya later,&quot; I chirped into my window.<br>
        &quot;Did you like the movie?&quot;<br>
        &quot;Yep. Later on, man.&quot;<br>
        &quot;I-uh&#133;well&#133;I guess I should go.&quot;<br>
        &quot;OK then, see you.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Um&#133;.&lt;&lt;sounds of fumbling with the seat belt, then the 
        car door opening&gt;&gt;&#133;Well&#133;Have a good night then,&quot; 
        he said and then finally stepped out of the car.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Out of the danger zone, I turned back around to wave and 
        smile&#133;a smile that slowly melted in a look of horror as the car door 
        began to re-open&#133;and then those words&#133;the words that to this 
        day ring in my ears&#133;<br>
        &quot;Hold on&#133;I am definitely trying something...&quot; (Here italicized 
        words indicate actual spoken words, as in SPOKEN OUT LOUD words)&#133;and 
        then, eyes closed, lips pursed in the most ridiculous way you can imagine, 
        he clamored over the gear shift, and&#133;kissed&#133;me. Deer in the 
        headlights does not quite do my expression justice. Maybe crazed kitten 
        caught in the path of a bullet train. I sat blinking, waiting for it to 
        end, and then finally, he pulled away, smiling suavely at a job well done&#133;and 
        then said, then actually said:<br>
        &quot;Later baby.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And this&#133;this&#133;well, this was my first kiss. Heinous 
        Hank. Traumatic? Oh, I think so. But hilarious all the same. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">*****<br>
        And so, you see&#133;all this, all of our agonizing will some day be an 
        amusing memory. That boy who makes you sad&#133;think of when he bit it 
        on the ice, tried to laugh it off, and then bit it again. That girl who 
        you just can't figure out&#133;remember when she was telling a story and 
        was attacked by a massive swallow (as in a gulp, not the bird&#133;however 
        the bird attack would be funny.) My point is simply this: there is little 
        in our love lives that is truly as heartbreaking as we imagine. So buck 
        up!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I hope it was a very merry Valentine's Day for all. May 
        all your kisses be more sweet and less Heinous. </p>
