      <p align="left">Unless you have major hearing or social problems, it should 
        not have escaped your notice that as of a couple weeks ago, Autobahn is 
        back. After a semester's hiatus, the triumph of the last two annual &quot;Battle 
        of the Bands&quot; pulled it together for a deafening, sexually invigorating 
        two-set show at Ladd House, featuring all five veteran members-Chris Bail 
        '02 (lead guitar and vocals), Colin Thibadeau '03 (bass), Dan Buckley 
        '02 (rhythm guitar), Ethan Bullard '03 (drums), and the very sexy Sarah 
        Ramey '03 (vocals)-and a new collection of original songs. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/ae01_autobahn.jpg" width="250" height="189"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">From left: Colin Thibadeau, Dan Buckley (top), Chris 
            Bail, Sarah Ramey, and Ethan Bullard. (Henry Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">But this was not exactly the Autobahn everyone remembers 
        from 2001. Clearly, the band that once dabbled with &quot;Communist rhetoric 
        and regalia&quot; and even brought its provocative gig to the uninspired 
        capitalists of Colby (a heated event that was reportedly a &quot;logistical 
        nightmare&quot; for the band's security team, headed by Mike Warner '02), 
        has refined itself. This year, Autobahn is moving away from its classic 
        image to begin more experimentation and development. So far, the results 
        have been impressive. <br>
        If you were fortunate or well-connected enough to push your way through 
        the wall of die-hard (and in many cases, inebriated) fans two weeks ago, 
        you were undoubtedly a witness to Autobahn's muted cohesiveness, which 
        is rarely overwhelmed by the volume of their performance. Over break, 
        the band officially reunited for a series of rehearsals in the wooded 
        seclusion of nearby West Bath, where the members could drown themselves 
        in their sound and a disgustingly excessive amount of breakfast foods 
        (in the opinion of this reporter). All members agree that the reunion 
        went smoothly: &quot;Chris is still the guilty dictator, Colin the lackey, 
        Ethan is a constant pain in the ass and Sarah gets kicked out of the band 
        almost on a daily basis,&quot; commented Buckley. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More importantly, the members were introduced to the new 
        songs that Bail had composed over the hiatus. When I caught up with Chris 
        to ask him about this, he was cooling down from an intense session of 
        pinball, stretching and sipping a frosty purple Gatorade.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;As a songwriter you have a complete picture in your 
        head and you know exactly how you want it to sound, but conveying that 
        message to others&#133;can be really frustrating,&quot; he commented. 
        For the most part, however, Bail feels that his songs have worked well 
        with the talents and styles of the other Autobahnos. Buckley confirmed 
        his satisfaction: &quot;Although at first listen some may be quick to 
        dismiss them as Radiohead or Pixies rip-offs, you can't deny that, taken 
        together, they have their own original sound and feel to them.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And according to Bullard, the added vocals from Ramey have 
        &quot;provided the band with a sense of matured sexual expression in what 
        has traditionally been a band of four male jerk-offs.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Thibadeau agreed, &quot;My name is Colin Thibadeau. I am 
        in the band.&quot;<br>
        Though Ladd was an unquestionable success, Autobahn is looking forward 
        to recording their first 6-track EP in the studio this spring. Bail, throwing 
        his voice into an ad-hoc but telling British accent, summed up the band's 
        ambitions for originality and success this semester: &quot;I think people 
        really appreciate live music here because there's such a profound lack 
        of [it], but I really don't want to go down in history as a crappy cover 
        band.&quot;</p>
