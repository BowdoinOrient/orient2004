      <p align="left"><font size="5">It's freezing out here</font><br>
        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font></p>
      <p>As we stumble out to our classes each morning, greeted by the blasts 
        of freezing air, terrain more suited to ice skates than to normal footwear, 
        ephemeral dashes of sunlight, and the roving packs of Arctic wolves, many 
        of us have good reason to question our own sanity. <br>
      </p>
      <p>What on Earth are we doing living here? Why do we live in this frozen 
        wasteland when more hospitable climes are just a few scant hours away 
        by car? The only bipeds God meant to live in these condition are penguins, 
        certainly not us hairless apes who arose on the considerably-warmer African 
        savannah. So what are we doing here in Maine during the depths of winter?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Granted, just under ten percent of the student body was actually born 
        in this state and is &quot;used to&quot; this type of weather. My friends 
        Goat and Bosse have told me of happy childhoods hunting polar bears and 
        travelling to school by snowmobile. I'm sure that was a lovely experience, 
        but I get the feeling that it's not universally applicable to the Bowdoin 
        College student body. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Right now you're wondering why you're reading another rant about the 
        cruddy weather. Heck, it's all people here talk about anyways (understandable, 
        when exposure to the elements here has very lethal consequences). But 
        gentle reader, I ask you to read on, for there is a method to my madness. 
        I intend to offer a solution.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After my freshman year, I seriously questioned the logic of anyone living 
        in Maine. Then I experienced my first Maine summer. For anyone who has 
        yet to experience this place in the summer months, it is imperative that 
        you do so before graduating. When I look out my window on the barren, 
        ice-covered landscape, I find it hard to believe that this is the same 
        place that can be so beautiful in the summer months. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hence, we should be here in the summer! Madness you say? Hardly. Many 
        other institutions offer either quarter schedules or other, year-round 
        academic arrangements that allow freedom to choose whether or not to be 
        at school during the summer.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I've heard that some polytechnical college in Hanover, New Hampshire 
        (maybe called Dartmound? Darfmouse? Dunno, I'll check) does this, and 
        to me it seems to be an excellent solution. For those of us who wish to 
        be here in the winter months, the opportunity would be still be available. 
        The saner students could thus safely retreat to the warmer sections of 
        our great nation during the colder months.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Our current academic calender stems from a time when most students came 
        from an agricultural background. Hence they were needed at home during 
        the summer months. Not to disparage the agricultural lifestyle, but the 
        vast majority of us will never be involved in the agricultural sector 
        (I do not include those who, like myself, have such limited career prospects 
        that fast-food preparation is on the horizon). Hence we should liberate 
        ourselves from its scheduling constraints and pursue a broader, year-round 
        scheduling plan. Not only will this free us from the constraints of Maine 
        winters (for those who wish to do so), it will also allow students a greater 
        flexibility in determining their education. As education evolves, so should 
        our institutions. As for myself, I just want to go where it's warm.</p>
