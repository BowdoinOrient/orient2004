      <p>At the much-touted Diversity Panel Discussion on Wednesday night, the 
        one conclusion everyone seemed to agree upon was that diversity is good.<br>
        What troubled me was that something seemed to be lacking from the conversation. 
        The panel and audience all agreed that we needed more diversity. But to 
        what end? When the question of our endgame-what goals we're hoping to 
        achieve-came up, the panel was, for all intents and purposes, stumped. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>And therein lies the problem. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Diversity, while &quot;good,&quot; is not, in and of itself, an end. 
        Racial, ethnic, sexual, gender, socioeconomic, (insert favorite type of 
        diversity here) diversity is all well and good, but what does the College 
        want to accomplish with it? <br>
        Answers-and I'm paraphrasing a bit here-ranged from &quot;We want diversity 
        so we can continue to build more diversity&#133;&quot; to talk of a &quot;critical 
        mass&quot; of self-perpetuating, diverse students. To be honest, this 
        made me think more of a Cold War-era nuclear arms race than a well thought 
        out plan for the College's future. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To the panel's credit, it admitted to an uncertainty in its mission, 
        but that admission doesn't let it off the hook. Bowdoin College has to 
        decide what its goals are, and then set about to achieve those goals. 
        Simply diversifying for the hell of it is not a goal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Wil Smith, one of the panelists, mentioned that he was skeptical as to 
        whether the school would continue to fund diversity-enhancing efforts 
        if the endowment runs into hard times. One of the strongest ways for the 
        College to ensure the continuation of that funding is to develop a clear 
        and decisive image for the future, and to work toward that goal. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If I were on the Board of Trustees during hard economic times and someone 
        came to me asking for money to enhance diversity, not explaining what 
        he or she wanted to accomplish with it, I wouldn't fund it, either.<br>
        When a problem arises, &quot;put more money into it&quot; is too often 
        the answer. </p>
      <p>I'm not saying that we shouldn't finance some of the diversity-promoting 
        programs we have. We have to decide first what we want to accomplish with 
        that diversity. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So here is my plan. <br>
      </p>
      <p>When George Will was here last year, he said intellectual diversity is 
        the only kind of diversity that matters. While I'm not sure I completely 
        agree with that, he makes a good point. Bowdoin is an institute of higher 
        learning. Therefore, our efforts to diversify should be directed towards 
        enhancing our education.<br>
      </p>
      <p>With this as a goal, diversity becomes more about what students can bring 
        to the proverbial table than the color of their skin. I fear we put too 
        much emphasis on what people look like and not enough on what they think. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>If beauty is truly on the inside, we need to make sure that our efforts 
        to diversify take that into account. Otherwise, we may end up with a campus 
        that looks like a rainbow, but where everyone thinks the same things. 
        What fun is that? What would we learn?<br>
      </p>
      <p>I find well-informed debate to be one of the most educational activities 
        I can engage in at Bowdoin. There are a lot of smart people with strong 
        opinions, and if I can argue my side, I can also learn from theirs, forcing 
        myself to question my own beliefs. At the end of a debate, I can reassess 
        my opinions, hopefully having learned something. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For such intellectual debate to work, however, we need students with 
        diverging views and opinions. It doesn't matter what color their skin 
        is, or where they're from, or how much money their families make. I would 
        rather learn more about what's in their heads and in their hearts. <br>
      </p>
      <p>So, get a bunch of students, blindfold them, and sit them around a table. 
        Let them talk, and see where the conversation goes. If everyone agrees, 
        Bowdoin cannot be diverse enough. If there is disagreement and passionate 
        debate where people are both challenged and educated, model the future 
        of Bowdoin on that.</p>
