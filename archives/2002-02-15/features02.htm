        STAFF WRITER</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For seniors, a month into spring semester is when thoughts 
        turn to the gentle winding-down of their Bowdoin career, when they will 
        approach the looming chasm of the after-life like a runaway train with 
        brakes screaming as it becomes clear that the bridge to the other side 
        is still under construction. At this time, seniors might start to think, 
        &quot;huh&#133;I need somebody&#133;not just anybody&#133;I need somebody&#133;&quot; 
        but what comes next? Who will hear these cries for help? <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Why, YALP, of course. That's right, YALP, that sound which 
        a small multi-breed dog might make if you were to tread too heavily upon 
        its tail with your L.L.Bean hiking boot is also an acronym that will become 
        incredibly meaningful to you as the end, or the beginning, approaches. 
        YALP stands for Young Alumni Leadership Planning, and in a few short months 
        (or a few short years&#133;that's right, time to start thinking about 
        the future, first-years!), YALP will be your best friend.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">YALP originated in 1998 as the crisis over the fraternities 
        was coming to a head. The controversy over the future of the Greek system 
        at Bowdoin drew attention to the absence of a forum for communication 
        between students and the Administration. YALP became an organization that 
        not only &quot;allowed students to voice concerns collected over their 
        four years&quot; as John Sprague of Alumni Relations described it, &quot;but 
        permitted the Administration to present a realistic picture of their roles 
        and the mechanisms in place to address these issues&quot;. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This aspect of YALP continues to this day, with members 
        meeting weekly with different individuals from the upper echelon of Bowdoin 
        Administrators. Just last week, Barry Mills met with these seniors and 
        candidly discussed his surprise at the extent to which fundraising dominates 
        in his overall schedule. The frank nature of these meetings provides an 
        environment in which students feel comfortable being equally forthcoming. 
        <br>
        While YALP continues to regularly hold roundtable discussions between 
        its members and administrators, its role as facilitator of alumni relations 
        has grown and become more specialized. YALP is now comprised of over forty 
        seniors and three student interns who are divided into four different 
        subcommittees. These committees allow for the group's wide span of roles 
        within YALP's reach.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Annual Fund Committee is dedicated to being a student 
        presence in the Annual fund, while the Career Services Committee helps 
        organize career panels with Bowdoin Alumni and create links between students 
        and alumni in specific career fields. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">John Thorndike, one of the senior interns, is a member of 
        the Basic Committee, which helps organize alumni interviewers for prospective 
        students unable to make the trip to Bowdoin. Thorndike became interested 
        in YALP after being a part of the Presidential search committee. He found 
        it gave him an opportunity to increase his understanding of the politics 
        and workings of behind-the-scenes Bowdoin, and was also impressed with 
        the contacts it afforded him. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Thorndike, like Tiffany Mok, another senior YALP intern, 
        was as drawn to their role as a voice for the student body as they were 
        with the personal training and connections they garnered. Thorndike hoped 
        that in future years, YALP forums might occasionally be turned into Bowdoin-wide 
        opportunities for communication. For the time being though, he felt that 
        the group was diverse enough &quot;to represent many of the class and 
        student body's issues accurately.&quot; He encouraged students to engage 
        YALP members in discussion of issues they would like to see addressed 
        within upcoming forums. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mok's group, the fourth and final, is the Alumni Relations 
        subcommittee, which deals with creating a student leadership to organize 
        the alumni affairs of their graduating class. This year marks the first 
        year that roles of class President and other organizing roles will be 
        open to seniors not involved in YALP. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While much of YALP's work comes towards the end of the year, 
        both with preparing seniors to become alumni and junior applications to 
        take the YALP reigns, you don't have to wait to join in the fun. In fact, 
        you may already have attended a YALP event. YALP was behind a pre-Winter 
        Ball Shindig, as well as numerous career panels still to come beyond the 
        Bowdoin campus. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The moral of this story is that the forty seniors who make 
        up the Young Alumni Leadership Planning are there for the rest of the 
        class, and the school's, benefit. They can help you take advantage of 
        alumni resource opportunities, and maintain connections with your class 
        after you spread to the four winds. They can also help you give back to 
        the community before you leave, by imparting wisdom gained from four years 
        spent in the thick of Bowdoin to the administrators who can use it to 
        shape your alma mater's future. So as you make the leap from Bowdoin student 
        to Real World Participant, don't be afraid to ask for a little YALP. </p>
