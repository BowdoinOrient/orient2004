        COLUMNIST</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In 1862, the second year of the Civil War, Congress met 
        in December to deal with the critical military situation. At that point, 
        William Pitt Fessenden, a proud Bowdoin graduate, was Chairman of the 
        Senate Finance Committee. Like his colleagues, he had not been happy with 
        how things were being run. In January 1863, Fessenden wrote of his President's 
        cabinet, &quot;The simple truth is, there never was such a shambling, 
        half and half set of incapables collected in one government before since 
        the world began.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite his distrust of the administration, the senator 
        got a lot done in his own realm. Under Fessenden's eye the 1863 Loan Act 
        gave the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to continue to finance 
        the War with almost five hundred million dollars in loans. The National 
        Currency Bill, which pushed for a national currency under federalized 
        banking associations, was also passed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Other matters that concerned the United States Senate at 
        the time included the removal of Native Americans from the new state of 
        Kansas. Senator Fessenden stood opposed to the idea for it was, in his 
        opinion, a ridiculous plan to continue pushing the Native Americans deeper 
        and deeper into the continent. Why not extend a hand of friendship instead 
        of the bayonet, Fessenden wondered. &quot;Suppose you remove them to the 
        Indian Territory, how long will it be before the whites encroach on them 
        there?&quot; It would be the same show over and over again, Fessenden 
        argued, but of course none of his colleagues really cared.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, as the year drew on, Thomas Hyde of the Bowdoin 
        Class of 1861 returned to duty. Near the end of April, Union General Joseph 
        Hooker began a new campaign in the East. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hooker's plan called for General John Sedgwick to remain 
        watching the rebel position across the river from Fredericksburg, Virginia, 
        as the bulk of the army marched around the Confederate flank and rear 
        to take the enemy from behind. Between two superior Union forces, no matter 
        where he turned, Robert E. Lee would finally be caught and destroyed. 
        &quot;May God have mercy on General Lee,&quot; Hooker declared, &quot;for 
        I will have none.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We have already explored what happened to Hooker (in the 
        Oliver Howard Series from last year's Orient) as he marched into the Wilderness 
        that fateful spring. Now, however, we take another perspective to the 
        Battle, for Thomas Hyde was serving on General Sedgwick's staff at the 
        time. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As Hooker moved into the wilderness, he sent orders for 
        Sedgwick to advance against the heights behind Fredericksburg. Deep fog 
        obscured Union intelligence officers but Sedgwick sent out two regiments 
        to probe the enemy line on the morning of May 3, 1863. Behind schedule 
        and fighting on ground that was haunted by the memory of the thousands 
        who fell there, the two regiments received a heavy handling by the rebels, 
        which Lee had left behind under General Jubal A. Early. In truth, Early 
        had a mere 9,000 men to cover a line more than six miles long. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The position, however, was a strong one and Sedgwick's men 
        recoiled. Hyde helped reform and organize the fallback of the troops and 
        here the fog was a friend rather than a foe. The Bowdoin graduate remembered, 
        &quot;The experience was not pleasant, however, of being fired at personally 
        by as many Southerner marksmen as took a notion.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sedgwick hit the line again and this time Hyde remembered 
        seeing the Union flag rising above the enemy works. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Serving as the provost marshal at the time, Hyde was responsible 
        for taking care of the enemy prisoners, which numbered 1,500. Having attended 
        to this business Hyde rejoined Sedgwick's staff and marched forward to 
        help attack Lee.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sedgwick's advance towards Chancellorsville (11 miles distant 
        by the Orange Plank Road), however, was delayed by stubborn rebel troops 
        under General Cadmus Wilcox. The Confederates rallied in a new defensive 
        line behind Salem Church, five miles out of Fredericksburg. Wilcox had 
        just received some reinforcements from another rebel division (more troops 
        would soon follow along with Lee himself), which was being sent over from 
        Chancellorsville. Sedgwick's attacks at Salem Church failed to dislodge 
        the rebel defenders and were thrown back.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That night, behind Sedgwick's own defensive position, hearing 
        no sounds of fighting from Hooker's direction (a mere six miles off in 
        the wilderness) and wondering what the Sixth Corps was marching into, 
        Hyde wrote, &quot;an ominous rumbling of wheels was the only sound that 
        broke the stillness. This showed that the enemy was diligently reinforcing 
        from Lee's army, which was between us and Hooker, and the entire absence 
        of all sounds of battle or any communication from Chancellorsville was 
        most strange and ill boding.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lee had turned his columns back towards Fredericksburg to 
        fight Sedgwick. At Salem Church, having almost surrounded Sedgwick's column 
        with three exhausted divisions, Lee prepared to do what he had failed 
        to do with Hooker, destroy a part of the Union army.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sedgwick had maneuvered himself into a trap and was desperately 
        trying to get out of it. He sent three staff members to find Hooker and 
        ask for directions. Two of those did not return, but Thomas Hyde did with 
        orders for Sedgwick to save himself. Hyde remembered that stressful afternoon 
        (May 4, 1863) as Confederate troops closed in from multiple directions 
        to attack the Sixth Corps. Lines broke and reformed as gun smoke filled 
        the battlefield and the thunder of guns roared for miles around. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Perhaps owning to the exhausted state of the Army of Northern 
        Virginia and uncoordinated assaults, the rebel attacks failed to accomplish 
        what Lee had intended. As Sedgwick retreated across the Rappahannock River 
        at Scott's Ford that night, some rebel troops harassed his units, but 
        no major engagement was fought and the Federals got away.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Battle of Chancellorsville was over, and yet again it 
        was a Union disaster. Thomas Hyde had seen battle and escaped with barely 
        a scratch. The nation, however, had not. There needed to be some good 
        news soon, or else no amount of emancipation proclamations or national 
        currency bills would save the Union.<br>
