        <font size="2">ALISON L. McCONNELL</font><font size="2"><br>
        ORIENT STAFF</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Any person on the street can tell you how enormous the costs 
        of a private college education are these days. With the economy in a slump 
        and the stock market making only minimal gains on last year's selloffs, 
        the question can't help but be begged: are Bowdoin parents feeling the 
        pinch?<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Directory of Student Aid Stephen Joyce, financial 
        difficulty is not increasing among Bowdoin parents at markedly higher 
        rates than last year. Aid numbers at the College are, for the most part, 
        comparable to last year's.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The economy certainly has affected families; we're 
        not insulated from that,&quot; he said. &quot;There has been some shift 
        toward more need and more requests for aid, but it hasn't been huge yet,&quot; 
        he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Joyce, applications for financial aid, while 
        not finalized for the 2002-2003 academic year until the spring, probably 
        won't be much different from last year. However, some parents may have 
        experienced changes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;When students are turning in their renewal apps for 
        next year, it will be very interesting to see whether the assets side 
        has changed a lot and how family expectations has changed because the 
        market is down,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One area that has seen a moderate increase is mid-year reviews. 
        Financial aid awards are designed for the full academic year, when something 
        happens to a family's situation during the term, the office will go back 
        and reevaluate the circumstances. &quot;We have had slightly more families 
        apply for a mid-year review this year,&quot; Joyce said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On a national level, the negative effects of economic downturn 
        have led increased numbers of parents to approach schools with news of 
        layoffs and inability to make payments. Joyce said that the College has 
        experienced some such problems, but hasn't seen a distinct trend. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;[Sometimes] a parent has been laid off, or gone from 
        full-time to part-time,&quot; he said. &quot;Those folks tend to come 
        to us pretty soon because they've got a real cash flow issue and need 
        help with that.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Usage of payment assistance agencies like the Academic Management 
        Service has increased nationally, in spurts upward of 25 percent in single 
        months. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We have a lot of parents who use those anyway,&quot; 
        Joyce said. &quot;The monthly payment plans allow parents to contract 
        for a certain amount of their bills; Bowdoin gets paid up front, and the 
        family pays the intermediary back on a monthly basis.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Cost is a huge factor for us; when they get up to 
        $35,000 to 38,000 a year, all of a sudden, that's a huge percentage of 
        [a family's] income,&quot; he added. &quot;Unless they're spreading it 
        out some way, either with the monthly payment plans or, more likely, with 
        loans, we get more and more families on that margin of need.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Much about next year's financial aid picture is unclear, 
        but will sharpen as spring moves in. The Student Aid Office attempts to 
        develop an idea of what assistance is required as the newest class is 
        admitted and already-enrolled students declare their needs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Returning students are asked for [financial aid application] 
        forms on March 5, and we know that some will be late because of April 
        15 and tax returns,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;We spend most of March and 
        April with the Class of 2006, making sure that they've got what they need. 
        Then we do the returning students.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since the College guarantees its ability to meet the need 
        of all returning students, one would hope that factors like the economy 
        would have been taken into consideration last year. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Indeed, Joyce said, such things were factored into budgetary 
        decisions. &quot;We budget to meet the full need,&quot; he said. &quot;We've 
        anticipated the tuition going up and the softening of the economy.&quot;<br>
