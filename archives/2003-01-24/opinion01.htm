        <font size="2">LARA JACOBS</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Affirmative action is a sensitive issue. Regardless of 
        race, it can make or seemingly break a high school student's chances for 
        admissions at prestigious colleges and universities across the country. 
        For middle to upper class students and their parents, the program has 
        the potential to prevent these students' acceptance. </p>
      <p>According to a recent article by Jacques Steinberg in the New York Times, 
        &quot;Admissions officers acknowledge that they generally demand white 
        applicants with well educated parents&quot; to have at least a 1400 on 
        the SATs, while &quot;a black applicant with similar grades&#133;.might 
        get in with an 1150&quot; (January 5, 2003). As the author of &quot;Race 
        and the Fight for Admission to the Best Colleges&quot; also pointed out, 
        &quot;In a nation of few formal class distinctions, the college sticker 
        on one's car may be the most potent [status symbol].&quot; </p>
      <p>Thus the controversy surrounding affirmative action is not really about 
        whom colleges are admitting, but rather about whom they're not-white students. 
        Two white students who were denied admission to the University of Michigan's 
        College of Arts and Sciences and Law School are suing the school, claiming 
        that they were passed over for less qualified minority students and that 
        had they been admitted, &quot;[their lives] would be significantly different.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>Regardless of the ruling, the decision will have serious repercussions 
        for higher education, either entrenching a controversial system or eliminating 
        advantages for those less privileged. Speaking out against the policy, 
        President Bush claimed, &quot;Systems that use race to include or exclude 
        people from higher education and the opportunities it offers are divisive, 
        unfair and impossible to square with the Constitution.&quot; </p>
      <p>One possible alternative, which politicians expect Bush will suggest, 
        is an elimination of affirmative action in favor of the &quot;Top 10 Percent 
        Law&quot; which guarantees admission to the University of Texas at Austin 
        for all high school seniors in Texas who finish in the top ten percent 
        of their high school classes. Theoretically, the plan levels the playing 
        field, ensuring that black students compete against black, white against 
        white, and Hispanic against Hispanic within each school. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Austin's minority enrollment is significantly lower than 
        it was before affirmative action was abolished. Texas officials tend to 
        cite the reasoning for this being that the plan ensures that only the 
        truly qualified are admitted, perhaps lowering the racial representation. 
        Nevertheless, under Texas' affirmative action program, each freshman class 
        included about 500 blacks, or 4 percent of new students. In 1997, however, 
        the year after the ruling, only 296 new students, or 2.3 percent, were 
        black. </p>
      <p>As most people know, limited diversity is a problem for the majority 
        of top schools in this country. However, I have not heard any argument 
        to decrease the number of students from prep schools and from upper middle 
        class white backgrounds for the sake of diversity at these colleges and 
        universities. Instead, Bush and his followers propose eliminating the 
        sole program responsible for making college campuses more representative 
        of the array of cultures and races within the United States. </p>
      <p>In reality, has there ever been a case made against the number of legacy 
        students admitted to these top schools? If Bush dares to call affirmative 
        action unconstitutional, what does he consider his admission to Yale-fair 
        play? </p>
      <p>Affirmative action is not ideal; yet imagine the cost of removing the 
        system. Schools would be more than willing to select self-sufficient white 
        students over lower-income and minority candidates requiring financial 
        aid, a decision affirmative action prohibits universities from making. 
        Thus, for all the students who aren't born with a silver spoon in their 
        mouths, spitting up on a Harvard bib, let's hope the Supreme Court will 
        not rule against affirmative action. While the program, as with most aspects 
        of the college admissions process, leaves much to be desired, it is the 
        only means we currently have for slightly leveling the playing field.<br>
