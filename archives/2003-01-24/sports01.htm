      Since returning from their brief winter break, the Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey 
      Team has played in six games, the last of which was a match-up against the 
      University of Southern Maine. 
	  </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears have remained undefeated thus far, boasting a 
        record of 10-0-2. The first game back from break was an exhibition against 
        John Abbott College, resulting in a 6-2 win for Bowdoin. Gill McDonald 
        '04, Marissa O'Neil '05, Ba Lanoue '03 and captain Beth Muir '03 all scored 
        in the win, with Muir posting two goals. Goalies Cat MacEachern '06 (six 
        saves), Nathalie Morgan '06 (five saves, one goal allowed) and captain 
        Emily McKissock '03 (five saves, one goal allowed) split time in net for 
        Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
      In their first game back from studying abroad, juniors Kirsten Larsen, Jess 
      Burke, and Jen Pelkey wasted no time making an impact. In her first action 
      of the season, Larsen scored against John Abbott assisted by Pelkey and 
      Burke.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Two-time NESCAC Player of the Week (December 9 and January 6) Marissa O'Neil 
      noted, &quot;With the return of the abroad girls, laughs are sure to come.&quot; 
      Without a doubt, the wins will also continue to pile up for the undefeated 
      squad.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Beginning a stretch of four away games, the Polar Bears blanked Trinity 
      4-0 with goals by Britney Carr '04, Pelkey, Muir, and Kelsey Wilcox '06. 
      Francesca Klucevsek-Whalen '03 (four saves) and McEachern (six saves) split 
      time in net for Bowdoin and posted a combined shutout. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Against Wesleyan, the Polar Bears, led by sophomore All-American Kirsti 
      Anderson's hat trick, rolled over the Cardinals and finished with an impressive 
      10-1 victory. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Katherine Duglin '05, Rebecca Selden '06, Pelkey, All-American Shelly Chessie 
      '03, and Burke all knocked one in for the Bears, and Muir added another 
      two. O'Neil and Chessie posted three assists apiece. </p>
      <p align="left">
      In a much anticipated weekend, the number two ranked Polar Bears defeated 
      Williams, and the next day tied NESCAC archrival Middlebury. At Williamstown, 
      the Bears skated past the Ephs with goals by Duglin, O'Neil, and Chessie. 
      McKissock made 21 saves in the victory. </p>
      <p align="left">
      The real moment of truth came the next day in an intense game against Middlebury. 
      Ranked two spots behind Bowdoin in the national rankings, Middlebury put 
      up 40 shots but could only sneak one puck by Bowdoin goalie McKissock. The 
      NESCAC recognized her effort by awarding her Player of the Week status. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
      Teammate O'Neil said, &quot;I think Emily definitely deserves her honor; 
      she played amazing in the Middlebury game. Big players show up for big games, 
      and she did just that.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
      Said McKissock, &quot;Our success last season has made our team more visible 
      within the league and national scene. That visibility has personally motivated 
      me, as a Bowdoin athlete, to perform at a higher level.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
      In a game that was plagued by questionable officiating and something that 
      reeked of a little hometown cooking at worst, the Bears killed two of the 
      three five-on-three opportunities for the Panthers. On the offensive end, 
      Shelly &quot;Prime Time&quot; Chessie scored unassisted in the first period, 
      providing the only offense for Bowdoin.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Despite the two ties, McKissock is pleased with the play of the team thus 
      far. She commented, &quot;The season has gone incredibly well so far. I 
      think that we've only benefited positively from any expectations about our 
      team. We have no losses thus far in the season, and we have just completed 
      a very successful weekend against Middlebury and Williams. The first years 
      are all contributing, and with four goalies we're very strong in net.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
      O'Neil added, &quot;I feel that we picked up where we left off last year. 
      It was a great jump-start to our season. Despite a few injuries to key players, 
      I feel that there is no game we can't win if we show up to play. Because 
      we are ranked second in the country, teams are really gunning for us and 
      want to hand us our first loss. We need to keep working hard despite the 
      pressure.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
      When asked about an ensuing rivalry between them for NESCAC Player of the 
      Week honors, O'Neil replied, &quot;I would say there is no competition between 
      the two of us at all, until you brought it up! Now things might get a little 
      heated.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
      However, McKissock replied, &quot;I think Marissa more than deserves the 
      award. She's a great player, and I know how hard it must be for her to get 
      noticed out there for her talent, because she's just so darn short!&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
      Be sure and check out the action this weekend as the Bears take the ice 
      at home against the Connecticut College Camels at 7 p.m. tonight and Saturday 
      at 3 p.m. in Dayton Arena.
