      <p align="left">The idle boredom of winter break often leaves students longing 
        for the comfortable immersion of the Bowdoin Bubble. And while disappointed 
        students returned this week to find the Bowdoin Pines buried under a mountain 
        of snow and ice, they also returned to find their beloved Polar Bears 
        in first place in the NESCAC standings. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite losses to Salem State College and Middlebury College during the 
        semester break, the men's hockey team is once again poised to make a run 
        for the playoffs.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;This is some of the best hockey I have ever seen,&quot; said Coach 
        Terry Meagher, in reference to the last three weeks of play, which included 
        an overtime win against rival Williams College. &quot;There are areas 
        of the game we need to work on,&quot; said Meagher, &quot;but on the whole 
        I couldn't have asked for more from these guys at this point in the season.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        After wins on the road against Skidmore College and the Massachusetts 
        College of Liberal Arts December 6 and 7, the Polar Bears took a much 
        needed break from the ice, confident in their perfect 6-0 record.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin picked up the reins after Christmas at the annual Salem State 
        Invitational Tournament on December 27 and 28, where the Polar Bears took 
        on Worcester State College and host Salem State College. The first match 
        of the weekend was highlighted by a hat trick from Albert Mayer '03, as 
        the Polar Bears pummeled Worcester State, 14-2. Freshman Andy Nelson also 
        turned in an impressive performance, and tied a school record by collecting 
        five assists in the game.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, the following day did not bring the same success, and the Polar 
        Bears suffered their first loss of the season to Salem State. Despite 
        out-shooting the host Vikings 48-27, Bowdoin was unable to get past the 
        goaltending of Kaleb Christenson, losing 5-2. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;This league is deep, and there are so many good teams,&quot; said 
        Coach Meagher about the loss. &quot;[Salem State] had a great goaltender, 
        and they played well.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nevertheless, the Polar Bears were not discouraged, and they returned 
        home to Dayton Arena on January 10 to take on UMass-Boston. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin celebrated the first match of the new year with a win, and sent 
        UMass-Boston home packing, defeating the Beacons 4-3. Captain Sean Starke 
        '03 scored the winning goal in the third period, and the Polar Bear defense 
        held off a late Beacon shooting flurry. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The next day saw even more success under the Dayton rafters, as the Polar 
        Bears beat Babson College 5-2. When the Williams hockey team arrived in 
        Brunswick on January 17, Bowdoin held an impressive 9-1-0 record on the 
        season.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Before a bustling crowd, and led by the incredible goaltending of Junior 
        Mike Healey, Bowdoin stood tied with a scrappy Williams squad at the end 
        of regulation last Friday. But just a minute into overtime, Chris Pelletier 
        '04 put the game-winning shot into the net, and carried the evening for 
        a breathtaking 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It was a great game, and it was even better to see so many fans 
        there, even before the start of school,&quot; said a grateful Meagher.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The following afternoon, the Polar Bears could not muster the same magic 
        as the previous evening, and suffered their second loss of the season 
        last Saturday to a nationally ranked Middlebury team, 4-2. Despite strong 
        performances from seniors Adam Mantin and Chad Hart, Bowdoin dropped to 
        a still impressive 10-2-0 on the season.</p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;The score doesn't reflect how close the [Middlebury] game was,&quot; 
        said Captain Jared Porter '03. &quot;Nine times out of ten, I think we 
        could have won that game. Middlebury has always seemed a cut above us, 
        and this year we proved that we can play on par with them.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the Polar Bears travel to Massachusetts to take on Tufts University 
        this afternoon, their spirits are high and their will is strong. &quot;We 
        had some big wins over break,&quot; remarked Senior Captain Ryan Seymour. 
        &quot;The win against Babson was huge. Beating Williams was amazing. Tufts 
        is going to be a challenge, and we have a huge game against Trinity next 
        week. The fate of this team is in our hands.&quot;</p>

        Go U Bears!</p>
