      <p align="left"><font size="5">Celtic critics: back off improved team<br>
        <font size="2">ERIK SPRAGUE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Critics of the Boston Celtics, including Boston Globe sports 
        writer Peter May, have levied the charge that the Celtics are worse off 
        than they were one year ago. Like May, these critics point to the lackluster 
        play of Vin Baker, the Celtics' $50 million off-season acquisition. </p>
      <p align="left">
        That's all well and good, but considering Baker was not even on the team 
        last season-unless he proves to be a distraction in the locker room (which 
        by all accounts he isn't)-the addition of Baker to the roster has not 
        made the Celtics a worse team than they were last year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        These same critics point to the losses of Kenny Anderson, last year's 
        starting point guard, and sixth-man Rodney Rodgers, who played an important 
        role in last year's stretch and playoff run by continually knocking down 
        clutch three-point shots. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As for the loss of Anderson, it was evident until recently that the Celtics 
        direly missed their previous floor general. The offense looked stagnant 
        with a lot of players just standing around and waiting for someone to 
        jack up an outside shot. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So in terms of losing Anderson, the Celtics nay-sayers appeared to have 
        a valid point. However, this obvious need at the point left by Anderson 
        seems to have been adequately filled by J.R. Bremer, an undrafted rookie 
        point guard out of St. Bonaventure. He has played superbly since given 
        the opportunity when veteran Tony Delk went out of the lineup with a sprained 
        ankle. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In fact, just this week, Coach Jim O'Brien declared that Bremer was his 
        guy and that, even when healthy, Delk would not be reclaiming his starting 
        position. Although still a raw rookie, Bremer has shown the ability to 
        set up his teammates and demonstrated a knack for hitting open jumpers 
        and taking his man off the dribble.</p>
      <p align="left">
        With regards to the loss of Rodgers, who signed with the Atlantic Division-leading 
        New Jersey Nets, he is currently sidelined with a strained left calf. 
        Additionally, he is only averaging 7.6 points per game, down significantly 
        from the 11.9 points he averaged with the Phoenix Suns and Celtics last 
        season. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Moreover, while he is a big body, and the Celtics are still in need of 
        imposing prescences inside to rebound, Rodgers never did much of that 
        anyway when he was with Boston. Conversely, he primarily did most of his 
        work from the perimeter with the three-point shot. </p>
      <p align="left">
        While Tony Delk struggled with his shot last year, Rodgers provided a 
        valuable shooting threat from outside. This season, however, Delk has 
        more than come out of his horrendous shooting slump and has regained his 
        status of one of the premiere outside shooters in the Eastern Conference. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        May charged that the Celtics are worse team than they were one year ago. 
        While a certain amount of criticism of the Celtics is expected and probably 
        warranted, for May to conclude that they will not repeat their success 
        of last year, culminating in a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, 
        is undeserved halfway through the season. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Based on record alone, 24-17, they are currently in second place in the 
        Atlantic Division and in fourth place overall in the Eastern Conference. 
        They trail the conference-leading Indiana Pacers by five games, which 
        places them right in the thick of the race. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If they were ten games out or more, or if there was concern over the effort 
        they were exuding, then I could understand May's comments. But that's 
        not the case here, and so his criticism seems to be off base.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Moreover, this is the NBA, not the NFL; thus, the season is a marathon, 
        not a sprint. The season is 82 games long, and it is almost impossible 
        to predict what is going to happen over the next 41 games. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nonetheless, for the time being, the Celtics seem to being playing at 
        a high level, on a par with the other Eastern Conference powers, such 
        as Indiana, New Jersey, and Detroit. And they have won four in a row, 
        which puts them in a tie with Dallas and San Antonio for the current longest 
        winning streak in the league. </p>
      <p align="left">
        More important than the record, though, is the fact that they are starting 
        to gel together as a group, which was a foreseeable problem going into 
        this year, considering the different makeup of the team following off-season 
        acquisitions. While the Celtics will still only go as far as Paul Pierce 
        and Antoine Walker take them, they are receiving key contributions from 
        role players like they did during their stretch and playoff run last year. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Celtics appear to have found something special in Bremer, who, in 
        light of his rookie status, could be wearing Celtic green for some time. 
        And Kendrick Brown, now in his second year, is finally becoming a factor, 
        especially on the defensive end. He is proving to be a force on defense 
        with his raw athletic ability. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Brown is easily the fastest player and highest leaper on the Celtics, 
        which allows him to come up with important steals and loose balls, as 
        well as rebounds. Lastly, Delk has reestablished himself as a threat from 
        outside and, like Bremer, is hitting the open shot when Pierce gets double-teamed. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        One thing is for sure: for better or worse, the Celtics are a different 
        team from last year. And while the result at the end of the season will 
        be the final word as to whether they are a better or worse them than one 
        year ago, May might be changing his tune very shortly. Let's hope so.
