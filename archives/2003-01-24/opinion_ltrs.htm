      <p align="left"> To the Community: </p>
      <p> The academic integrity of the College relies heavily on student effort, 
        however that integrity would falter without the dedication and the commitment 
        of the Bowdoin faculty. The faculty's tireless effort to guide and instruct 
        the work of their students, their unending pledge to increase intellectual 
        curiosity on campus and their wealth of both knowledge and energy often 
        go unrecognized. BSG (Bowdoin Student Government) would like to recognize 
        those faculty members who have done an outstanding job, those professors 
        who have put in the extra effort, those mentors who have made a deep impact 
        on the lives of their students. </p>
      <p>With this in mind, BSG has established the highly coveted Professor of 
        the Semester Award. At the end of the past semester, all students had 
        the opportunity to vote and share personal stories about the professor 
        that influenced them most profoundly over the past semester. Many professors 
        were nominated and many compelling stories were told. However, after careful 
        review of all submissions, two professors were selected: Professor Jonathan 
        White, Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and 
        Anthropology and Professor Jeffrey Nagle, Professor of Chemistry. BSG 
        would like to formally congratulate Professors White and Nagle for all 
        of their hard work. We would like to further thank the faculty at large 
        for their time and dedication; it has not gone unnoticed. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Defending defibrillator equipment</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Editors:</p>
      <p> Recent submissions to the Orient by Kerry Elson (&quot;College installs 
        emergency defibrillator equipment&quot;) and Jim McDonald (&quot;Drop 
        the slogan and skip a week&quot;) deserve corrections and clarifications 
        on the function and role of an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED). 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Early defibrillation is the single most important factor for a patient 
        to survive cardiac arrest (Emergency Care, 2001). Although Elson said 
        &quot;the apparatus is usually used as a last resort if the patient does 
        not respond to 'Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation',&quot; a defibrillator 
        is the only viable method for creating normal heart rhythms. CPR alone 
        will rarely save someone in cardiac arrest. Further, the AED may not restore 
        a patient's consciousness, and those patients who are restored to a normal 
        heart rhythm are at high risk of going back into ventricular fibrillation. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Elson also noted that the &quot;AED monitors the breathing and heart rate 
        of the individual in order to administer electrical shocks.&quot; Defibrillators 
        recognize the most common normal and abnormal heart rhythms, whereas the 
        detection of an abnormal rhythm by the AED will allow the patient to be 
        shocked. If the AED does not detect a &quot;shockable&quot; rhythm, it 
        will not allow the rescuer to proceed. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Given that people of all ages may experience cardiac arrest, the AED is 
        not a &quot;mobile electric chair&quot; as McDonald said, but rather a 
        lifesaving tool that is important to have on our campus. No one said, 
        &quot;a sixth grader could use this instrument;&quot; there are certain 
        precautions that need to be carefully followed. First of all, emergency 
        medical services and security should be contacted immediately. Secondly, 
        before CPR or rescue breathing are initiated, it should be confirmed that 
        the patient is unconscious, not breathing, and does not have a pulse. 
        Thirdly, in the event that the AED finds a shockable rhythm, it is essential 
        that all rescuers be clear of the patient and anything that may conduct 
        electricity. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Automatic External Defibrillator is an important and lifesaving piece 
        of equipment. Cardiac arrests outside of the hospital occur at a rate 
        of around 1000 a day, and evidence shows that after ten minutes, the survival 
        rate drops to less than 2 percent without defibrillation (Heart Disease 
        Weekly, 2002). </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the first ten months following the installation of AEDs in Chicago's 
        O'Hare Airport, nine of 14 cardiac arrest victims were saved using the 
        AED, a 75 percent survival rate. AEDs have been proven to save lives; 
        training for using an AED can be pursued through the American Red Cross 
        and the American Heart Association. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
