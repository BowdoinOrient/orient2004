      Although his films won countless special awards, Alfred Hitchcock was never 
      recognized as the best director in the United States. However, most would 
      agree that suspense film as we know it today would not exist if it were 
      not for Alfred Hitchcock, the director, producer, screenwriter and actor. 
      <p align="left">
      There's an enormous possibility that everyone has been exposed to a Hitchcock 
      film at one time or another, but for those of you who never have, now is 
      the time. I urge you to go for the obscure films just as much as the famous 
      ones. Each film has its own charm and mystery. Even sixty years after their 
      creation, these films are more entertaining and more skillfully presented 
      than some of the garbage put out today.</p>
      <p align="left">
      For example, why would someone even think of remaking Psycho (1960) to fit 
      a modern world? Psycho (1998) was a complete disaster to American viewers 
      who recognized that it could easily be put to shame next to Hitchcock's 
      timeless classic. Besides, the original Psycho has more drama and suspense 
      than any other movie of its time, possibly more than most films that came 
      after. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Hitchcock's films were the first step towards the development of the genre 
      of thrillers, and to a large extent, they remain the best of their kind.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Alfred Hitchcock uses many different techniques that contribute to the success 
      of his suspense thrillers. He provides information for his audience by drawing 
      attention to details. This gives the audience an inside look at information 
      that his characters themselves are not aware of until it is too late. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Almost all of Hitchcock's films are psychological thrillers. Hitchcock uses 
      camera techniques to convey unspoken truths. A good portion of his best 
      known films were shot in black and white, and the director was a master 
      at using shadows and lighting in order to enhance the effect of the photography 
      in his films. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Hitchcock became a full fledged director in 1921 producing nine silent films 
      early in his career. Even in the absence of words, these films provided 
      anticipation and suspense because of the eerie images projected to the audience. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
      Hitchcock's first movie incorporating sound was Blackmail (1929). It is 
      still considered a masterpiece because of the way that Hitchcock carefully 
      and artistically uses sound to tell a story. His films' soundtracks magnify 
      essential themes in the plots of his mysteries. </p>
      <p align="left">
      For those looking to rediscover the world of genuine suspense, and master 
      filmmaking, films like North by Northwest (1959), Rear Window (1954), and 
      Vertigo (1958) are classics that should not be missed. The third is my personal 
      favorite of Hitchcock's pieces, with Psycho coming in at a close second. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
      Famous actors that frequently appear in Hitchcock films include Anthony 
      Perkins, James Stewart, Cary Grant. Hitchcock is also famous for putting 
      himself conspicuously into his own movies. With the exception of a few, 
      like Notorious (1946), he has cameos in all of his films. Other works of 
      his that are worth looking at include To Catch a Thief (1955), The Man Who 
      Knew Too Much (1934), The Birds (1963), Strangers On A Train (1951), and 
      Dial M for Murder (1954). Each of these will leave you on the edge of your 
      seat. And don't worry, for all of you who can't sit through a movie without 
      a love scene factored into the plot, all of these fulfill the necessary 
      requirements.
