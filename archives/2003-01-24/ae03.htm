      Bet you thought you'd never live to see Richard Gere, that sexy chick-flick 
      favorite dance up and down lighted steps while singing at the top of his 
      lungs over and over again. Yet here it is, in Rob Marshall's highly anticipated 
      film Chicago. 
      <p align="left">
      This is the Hollywood actor's ultimate talent show, headed up by newfound 
      divas Catherine Zeta-Jones and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger, in stagy leotards 
      and fishnets, belting it out harder than Bridget Jones ever did. It's not 
      a drama, a comedy, a chick flick, or a thriller, but a rarely seen genre 
      spectacle. Ladies and gentlemen, for your entertainment, Hollywood proudly 
      presents the amazing, state-of-the-art, hyper-realistic&#133;modern musical! 
      (Applause).</p>
      <p align="left">
      Enjoy this little taste of novelty while you still can, because only one 
      significantly popular musical seems to come out each year, if any at all: 
      Moulin Rouge in 2001, Dancer in the Dark in 2000&#133;South Park: Bigger, 
      Longer, and Uncut in 1999? </p>
      <p align="left">
      In any case, it's a meager dose, redeemed only by its excellent record come 
      awards season; last year's installment got eight Golden Globe nominations 
      and won three, while this year's received three out of seven, including 
      Best Picture: Musical or Comedy. Not too shabby for a first-time director, 
      not to mention a whole cast of first-time singers. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Chicago is a story about getting away with murder...in style. Roxie Hart 
      (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) is a heartless murderess with dreams of stardom 
      on Chicago's jazz stage. After killing her lover in cold blood she faces 
      a possible execution after a long stay in a women's prison. Her idol, singer 
      Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), is confidently awaiting trial for some 
      of her own bad girl behavior. Things look bleak for Roxie until she hires 
      Velma's lawyer, the famous Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), who turns her into 
      a sympathetic media celebrity, tugging on public heartstrings in a jazzy 
      spectacle that ultimately rips the blindfold right off of Justice herself.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Now, don't get me wrong; everyone involved in this film was phenomenal in 
      their own, musical way. But by no one's standards did Richard Gere &quot;act&quot; 
      better than Nicolas Cage in Adaptation, or Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love. 
      His rendition of &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; beat out Sandler's &quot;Lunch 
      Lady Land&quot; in overall male vocal performance, sure, but that doesn't 
      make him worthy of the gilded goblet he received. </p>
      <p align="left">
      On another note, Queen Latifah, though she can sing like no other and managed 
      to say her twenty lines in Chicago with a certain amount of flair, is not 
      in the same boat as her fellow Supporting Actress nominees. Her performance 
      was good, but not award good. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Roxie Hart-now that went beyond Global merit right 
      into Oscar territory. She's proven once again her versatility as an actress, 
      able to leap from romantic tart (Jerry Maguire) to depressed singleton (Bridget 
      Jones's Diary) to this year's bad starlet in a single bound-or six years-with 
      some unfortunate comic pitfalls in between, whatever. </p>
      <p align="left">
      Same could be said for Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose vampy vigor showed just 
      as well in her eyes and her moves as in her lines. This is a story without 
      heroes, and, true to form, every character, from our sly little lawyer to 
      Roxie's husband, the pathetically gullible Mr. Cellophane (John C. Reilly), 
      is deliciously despicable, a trait the cast pulls off wonderfully.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Probably the most important element in film musicals is the look. Unless 
      it's cinematically ravishing, exploiting everything that film has to offer, 
      the whole thing may come off looking like a couple of cameramen taped it 
      straight from Broadway, which would make it pretty stupid and useless, not 
      to mention a huge waste of both filmmakers' and viewers' precious time. 
      But Marshall got right down to the nitty gritty, the skeletal screenplay, 
      and played around with structure, editing, and other celluloid polish to 
      make this old story shine again, even brighter than before. </p>
      <p align="left">
      The cutting room replaces scene changes and the greater speed and flexibility 
      of this movie musical gives a more narrow and potent sense of excitement. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">
      The result is edge-of-your-seat musical mayhem that doesn't quite give you 
      time to take it all in, until the very end when you slowly stand up and 
      let out a long, satisfied sigh. Chicago will make you want to break into 
      the nearest costume closet, make off with a glittery white leotard, slick 
      your hair, wear your buckle shoes&#133;and all that jazz.
