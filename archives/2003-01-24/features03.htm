      <p align="left">History moved fast during that summer of 1940. On August 
        13, a few weeks before Bowdoin began its 139th academic session the Battle 
        of Britain began. Across the Channel that had been sailed for centuries 
        a new invading armada swept towards Dover's white cliffs. Long ago it 
        had been the Romans with their ships and legionnaires. In 1940 it was 
        the Luftwaffe, buoyed by its recent crippling of Allied operations in 
        France that tried its hand at conquering the British homeland. Preliminary 
        bombings had alerted the British to what was coming but many were still 
        unprepared for &quot;Eagle Day&quot;-August 13-when 1,400 German planes 
        from France flew to their targets in England. To fight this aggressor 
        from the sky the Royal Air Force mobilized its Spitfires and Hurricanes. 
        The heavens were darkened by the flying machines as they attempted to 
        come to grips with each other for the rich fields of the island empire. 
        The fighting in August raged on into the fall as Germany threw its fighters 
        and bombers against Britain's best-the men Churchill had proclaimed &quot;the 
        few&quot; who were owed so much by so many. Night bombings over London 
        became a common occurrence as the RAF struck back with bombing raids against 
        Berlin and the German homeland. Radar became a valuable weapon for the 
        British military while civilians became accustomed to the sounds of anti-aircraft 
        fire. The fighting raged on into the winter.</p>
      <p align="left">
        On the Bowdoin College campus there was also cannon fire; a battery of 
        sixteen guns fired a salute which echoed across the quad and could be 
        heard miles away. In a sense this was a fitting harbinger to what was 
        to happen in the next few years but for the Class of 1916, celebrating 
        their twenty-fifth reunion, it was simply to commemorate their love for 
        Bowdoin. One hundred and seventy-six members of the Class of 1944-among 
        them 21 sons of graduated Bowdoin men-joined the College that year. While 
        there were the usual tensions of a new academic session there was extra 
        trepidation that year; even the Orient admitted that it did not know how 
        to greet the first-years. &quot;We aren't quite sure if we should congratulate 
        you or pity you,&quot; an editorial noted. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The passage of the Selective Service Bill has made us see clearly that 
        we cannot be at all sure of the future. You have entered college during 
        a period of uncertainty and indecision. For this we pity you. But, we 
        do congratulate you for starting off on the opportunities which four years 
        of college will offer you. You will have limitless opportunities and, 
        come what may, there will always be a place in the world for the college 
        man as you will soon discover if you have not done so already.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Selective Service Bill, recently passed by Congress was, in a sense, 
        to show the American people that the Roosevelt Administration was not 
        sleeping on the job. War had broken out in Europe and all sides knew, 
        whether they wanted to believe it or not, that one way or another America 
        would be dragged into the conflict. As per the state's new law about one 
        hundred and sixty-three men from the College journeyed to the Brunswick 
        town hall to register for the draft. While there were conscientious objectors 
        the process went smoothly.</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were other new options for those students who did not wish to be 
        stuck in the infantry, for instance the Marine Corps or the infant Air 
        Force. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (C.A.A.) aided the College 
        in putting together a training course for students who were interested 
        in learning how to fly as a preparation for further military service. 
        The Controlled Pilot Training Course gave students a chance to soar to 
        the skies for up to fifty hours on seaplanes-another seventy-two hour 
        ground crew course along with a twenty-four hour study on air regulations 
        were also required to actually receive a private pilot's license. There 
        was, however, a limit to the number of men who could actually take the 
        course. When the cap was raised from fifteen to twenty, however, the course 
        was quickly filled. Bowdoin students, it appeared, enjoyed flying!</p>
      <p align="left">
        There were, however, dangers associated with this new found pleasure. 
        Robert Gaston Page '41 learned that lesson the following May when his 
        plane's engine stalled while he was practicing maneuvers above Topsham. 
        As his plane began to descend Page knew that he had to either jump or 
        find a place to safely set the plane down. The plane glided gently in 
        the breeze as it swung, without power, above pine trees and lakes. Page 
        was lucky, however, and found a small pasture, which seemed to be an adequate 
        landing spot. Summoning all his training and concentration Page attempted 
        to land, even though there was a pond, which flanked the pasture, and 
        made the descent even more hazardous. Slowly the plane, under the control 
        of a nervous Bowdoin senior, glided towards the pasture, touched the sought 
        ground bringing its tail down with a rough tug, rolled along the uneven 
        ground and came to a halt. Page, keeping his composure, walked to a nearby 
        farmhouse and telephoned for assistance. When the Orient interviewed the 
        lucky senior and asked what he felt, Page replied simple, &quot;All I 
        wanted was a cigarette.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Whether or not the United States was going to commit itself to another 
        World War was certainly a topic of discussion that revolved around the 
        possibility of having a new man in the White House. Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
        sought an unheard-of third term as President of the United States and 
        many feared that the dictatorship they saw rampant in Germany would happen 
        here at home. Bowdoin's students certainly felt that way as expressed 
        in an Orient poll conducted in the fall of 1940. According to the polling 
        numbers Bowdoin students greatly favored the presidential hopeful Wendell 
        Willkie by an overwhelming 78 percent. Everett Pope '41, captain of the 
        tennis team and now a senior expressed his opinion in a letter to the 
        editor:</p>
      <p align="left">
        President Roosevelt is seeking a third term. Even for a man with an excellent 
        record behind him to ask as much would offend Americans of both parties; 
        for this administration to attempt to perpetuate its tenure and its policies 
        is asking too much of a once-tolerant public. &#133; I ask you all to 
        do your best to disrupt our present scheme, and to return to the American 
        way with Wendell Willkie.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Among the faculty there was also discussion. While Prof. Orren C. Hormell 
        favored Willkie like the majority of the students, Prof. Athern Daggett 
        supported FDR for another four years; the Orient printed both opinions 
        in one of its issues before the November election. The fact that the Bowdoin 
        College students' opinions did not reflect national consensus should not 
        come as a surprise to anyone; Roosevelt returned to the White House and 
        would win one more election before his untimely death on the eve of victory 
        in Europe. </p>
      <p align="left">
        That the war was coming was a known fact by many. While some joined National 
        Guard units others considered different military branches. Some of those 
        who joined the National Guard were called up immediately and did not return 
        to Bowdoin till well after the war. The common feeling among the students 
        was that they should have a chance to control their own fate rather than 
        waiting to be called up in a lottery-this sentiment rang especially true 
        for the seniors who were soon to graduate into the dark, dark world beyond. 
        Both the Navy and Army came to Bowdoin to recruit for different branches 
        of both arms. For many Bowdoin men, however, they chose a lesser-known 
        branch of the armed forces. On a spring day, near the midpoint of the 
        second semester Everett Pope '41 found himself staring in awe at a handsome 
        visitor to the campus who wore a dark blue tunic and light blue pants 
        with stripes down the sides. Wondering about the identity of this striking 
        figure, Pope soon learned that he was a Marine recruiting agent. Here 
        began Pope's involvement with the Marine Corps. Others in his class, including 
        the beloved Andrew Haldane also signed up to serve.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Some house cleaning was done in the last weeks that the members of the 
        Class of 1941 spent on campus. A young Richard Carlton Johnstone of Waltham, 
        Massachusetts, Class of 1944 was elected to be the president of the sophomores 
        for the upcoming year while Haven G. Fifield was elected the life president 
        of the Class of 1941. Among the other life officers of the Class of 1941 
        were Everett Pope (Vice-President), Henry A. Shorey III (Secretary-Treasurer), 
        and Lendall B. Knight (poet). And almost as if four years passed in the 
        blink of an eye, the Class of 1941 prepared to leave Bowdoin's nurturing 
        halls and walk out into the uncertain world. Baccalaureate day dawned 
        with mixed emotions in the air. As the graduates and their guests solemnly 
        processed into the First Parish Church-the church that had seen so much 
        of Bowdoin's history-there was gloom and happiness but most of all, uncertainty. 
        Kenneth Sills in all his wisdom and prestige rose, as humble as he had 
        always been, as troubled now, as he had been in the days before the Great 
        War came to America. Choosing the subject of duty as his topic Sills began 
        to address the Class of 1941 for the last time as his beloved undergraduates.</p>
      <p align="left">
        When one passes to the consideration of the duties of citizenship one 
        enters a field of controversy and honest difference of opinion&#133;. 
        In the first place a man is born into a country as into a family, and 
        that simple statement implies certain obligations that no one can escape 
        and if he changes his country and adopts another he enters into the same 
        obligations. When young men become twenty-one they are now subject to 
        the Selective Service Act. Not many of you here have any great enthusiasm 
        for that act. Some of you are probably resentful, feeling that the act 
        is unnecessary and that it is unfair to take away one or two years form 
        a carefully planned life. &#133; Living in a democracy that after all 
        so far has done something for you and yours, you must obey the law; but 
        living in a democracy you also have the privilege of trying to change 
        the law if you so desire, of trying to persuade a majority of your countrymen 
        to get Congress to repeal the law. Do you think for a moment you would 
        have such a chance in Germany, or in Italy, or in Russia, or in what was 
        once Austria, or Poland or Czecho-Slovakia, or Jugoslavia, or Norway, 
        or Denmark, or Holland, of Luxembourg, or Belgium, in what was once and 
        pray God will be again beautiful and free Greece? &#133; There is no danger 
        of losing or impairing our freedom and our democracy unless we prove ourselves 
        to be a people too lazy and too inept to keep democracy. &#133; You know 
        what the right is, and, in the words of Burke, it is your duty to make 
        the right prevalent. That is a great challenge worthy of the sons of a 
        great college, and in meeting it, may God bless you.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Born in Bethel, Stanley Willis Allen '39 knew what is was like to wake 
        in the dark Maine night and feel the cool breeze slide swiftly over soft 
        human skin. The pine trees as the lakes and the coves were his home in 
        this state that had become a part of him. Even while in College at Bowdoin, 
        Allen did not leave his state. When not in school he worked as the manager 
        of Bethel Restaurant, and saved up for a future he must have dreamed of. 
        But Stanley Allen was a young man in troubled times and he knew his duty. 
        Whether this last was inspired by the revered President Sills or the friendly 
        and kind Dean Nixon, or whether Allen had himself been conscientious of 
        what he needed to do to ensure his future and the future of the United 
        States, he volunteered in the Navy after graduating in the Class of 1939. 
        Allen went through the training, probably thought of home and the cool, 
        clean Maine air on occasion and rose to the rank of ensign. His command 
        was the battleship U.S.S. Oklahoma, based at Pearl Harbor.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Like the armada that swarmed the British homeland, this smaller wave of 
        fighters, bombers and torpedo planes came across water to reach their 
        target. Thinner than the ranks of the Luftwaffe, these pilots were more 
        determined and had traveled much further to accomplish their mission. 
        Having left their aircraft carriers at sea, the planes-marked by a red 
        circle on their tails to designate the might of the rising sun-narrowed 
        in on their targets. Their flight path took them past some of the most 
        beautiful scenery on earth-untapped forests of tropical splendor, across 
        rocky beaches where the bounty of the mighty Pacific was thrown. For the 
        pilots, it must have felt like the flight took forever. Soon, however, 
        they saw dwellings, civilians, unsuspecting or disbelieving citizens who 
        looked upon these chariots in the sky with awe and sudden pangs of dread. 
        The planes moved on and from afar they could make out the United States 
        Pacific Fleet, in dock, moored to the shallow defenses of Pearl Harbor. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        It was Sunday, December 7, 1941-the day of infamy. Shortly before 8 A. 
        M. the first bombs were dropped. From afar and to the untrained eye of 
        a civilian, it may have seemed as if it took forever for the projectile 
        to descend. Perhaps this illusion was due to the magnitude of the event-was 
        this really happening? Who would dare disrupt the glorious might of the 
        greatest nation on earth? But slowly, helped by the physics of gravity 
        the bomb would descend, pre-aimed by the pilot, and find its target. The 
        explosions came from all around and bombs and torpedoes smashed into steal, 
        ripped apart living quarters, armaments, human beings. Many of the Fleet's 
        officers were ashore for the weekend and the ships were under the command 
        of young men who had never heard a gun fired in anger-men out of college 
        like Stanley Allen. Air bases on the islands of Hawaii were simultaneously 
        struck by the Japanese attackers. The reign of terror from the sky wrecked 
        dozens of planes that were still resting peacefully in the glittering 
        sunlight. For those who were there, it must has seemed like the world 
        was falling apart. Oklahoma took two hits and was already in bad shape 
        when a third struck just below the center of the vessel. The senior commander 
        onboard assessed the situation and realized that there was nothing he 
        could do. &quot;Abandon ship!&quot; he ordered in an attempt to get the 
        men to safety before it was too late. Shards of metal, pieces of dirt, 
        debris and clothes flew everywhere as the darkened halls tilted under 
        the ship's punctured hull. As the men were in the process of evacuating 
        a fourth torpedo struck and blew the battleship slightly upwards. When 
        Oklahoma landed, she turned on her side and capsized. The men who had 
        been holding onto the railings slid forward and fell towards the water, 
        their ship coming down upon them. The Arizona, most famous of the wrecked 
        battleships was struck by a bomb in its forward magazine. The eruption 
        could be heard even over the sound of the raging battle. As the ship exploded 
        from within it took with it 1,500 of its crew. Four hundred members of 
        the Oklahoma perished with her. The final count found 3,600 casualties 
        along with six battleships destroyed, more than half a dozen other vessels 
        damaged, and almost two hundred planes burning in the Sunday afternoon. 
        Clouds of thick black smoke billowed from the wreckage as oil and blood 
        filled with harbor and the sirens and alarms began to be heard over the 
        cries of the wounded and the dying. As the smoke rose above the battlefield 
        it clung against waving U.S. flags and then continued to rise, following 
        the wind that blew it, along with news of the attack, towards the continental 
        United States. To the nation Franklin Roosevelt would declare that America 
        had entered the war and to Bowdoin College, the news would later confirm 
        that Stanley Willis Allen had been one of those killed in action onboard
