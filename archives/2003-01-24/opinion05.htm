        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> There were many things that I realized I had forgotten 
        about Bowdoin while I was abroad. I forgot how wonderful Pat, who checks 
        cards at Moulton is, I forgot how awful the parking situation is, and 
        I forgot that at Bowdoin it is quite normal to overhear conversations 
        that go something along the lines of: &quot;Dude, she has a slammin' bod, 
        I'd totally do her-but personality-wise she sucks. I can't believe anyone 
        would date her.&quot; Likewise: &quot;Oh my god, I have such a crush on 
        him-I'd never hook up with him of course, but I totally want to go out 
        with him.&quot; Moreover, that there are couples that have a great sex 
        life and don't interact outside of that, as well as very intimate friendships 
        that are, for all intents and purposes, a relationship without the hookups. 
        After a brief glimpse into the real world, such seeming contradictions 
        are suddenly brought to my attention. So for my first column this year, 
        I would like to talk about THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ATTRACTION. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As the college students with raging hormones that we are, the most obvious 
        attraction is lust-pure, &quot;I want you&quot; lust, which is often referred 
        to as sexual tension. Meghan doesn't know what to do about Jason: &quot;I 
        don't think he's particularly good-looking and I don't think I'd ever 
        go out with him, but for some reason I am so physically attracted to him! 
        I don't know why! Every time we're around each other we just flirt like 
        crazy.&quot; Not that Jason is really ugly or isn't &quot;cool&quot; enough 
        for Meghan, they just don't really have much to talk about except for 
        the fact that they are attracted to each other. It's pretty obvious that 
        before they graduate, these two are definitely going to hook up-in fact, 
        I'm surprised it hasn't happened already.</p>
      <p align="left">
        I would like to commend Meghan for at least realizing that this kind of 
        attraction does not constitute a relationship. It is unfortunate that 
        at Bowdoin there are far too many people who do not have such insight. 
        Lust is healthy and normal and may be satisfied by random hookups. However 
        I cannot even try to list all of the &quot;relationships&quot; I know 
        of that are based on sexual tension alone. The couples do not particularly 
        care how each other feels (these are often those couples that don't acknowledge 
        each other in the dining hall) and just enjoy falling into bed together 
        when they're drunk, or taking cute pictures together before the Junior-Senior 
        Ball. Lust is fleeting and should not be confused with any sort of meaningful 
        connection.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Then there are some people who suffer from the Head Cheerleader + Football 
        Captain = Prom Court syndrome. That is, they think that they &quot;work&quot; 
        together for one reason or another. I guess this is some sort of attraction, 
        in a twisted like-attracts-like or image-lust kind of way. Such people 
        are not actually attracted to the mind or even the body of someone, but 
        rather the way a guy or girl's image will complement their own. For example, 
        I am pretty sure that Chip and Anne are together because they both wear 
        pink pants with ribbon belts and look really good together sailing Chip's 
        dad's sailboat from his summer house on MDI to her family compound in 
        Nantucket. They get absolutely hammered every night before they go to 
        bed because otherwise they would probably just lie there with nothing 
        to say to each other. At least they can stand each other; they've been 
        together almost a year and finally they are becoming friends. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are lots of people who have friends of the opposite sex (or same 
        sex if they happen to be gay) with whom they share a bond but there is 
        no chemistry. Let me assure you, this is possible-although as I argued 
        last year, it is also possible to be attracted to a friend and not have 
        that affect the friendship, but that was another article all together. 
        It's a shame that the ability to have great conversations with someone 
        is frequently mistaken for a reason to start a relationship. This doesn't 
        make that much sense to me-if a straight guy is lonely, he doesn't decide 
        to become gay and date one of his roommates; if you are not attracted 
        to someone, you should not try to be their boyfriend or girlfriend. Carrie 
        explains, &quot;I have so many guy friends whom I really care about but 
        just, for whatever reason, do not want to go out with. I don't know why, 
        but I guess it's that we don't have that special spark.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Which brings me to the conclusion that a relationship should be based 
        on something special, something that makes both people inexplicably happier. 
        It is not found between friendship and lust so much as it is found when 
        some perfect combination, which may change with each person and each relationship, 
        creates that spark. It is rare. This means that meaningful relationships 
        may not be as plentiful as one would like to think, but this is okay! 
        Be friends with people you care about but don't have any chemistry with, 
        hook up with those you are really attracted to and sooner or later you 
        will find someone you genuinely click with-you'll know when you do. </p>
