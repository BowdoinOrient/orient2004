      <p align="left"> <br>
        Wednesday morning, every member of Bowdoin's faculty and staff received 
        a personally addressed envelope containing a letter from President Mills 
        announcing the College's intentions to eliminate 25-30 positions. This 
        letter, now posted on the College's website, expressed the need to cut 
        spending in anticipation of the 2003-2004 fiscal year, which begins July 
        1.</p>
      <p align="left">
        According to Mills, the layoffs are intended to better prepare Bowdoin 
        for an uncertain future. While the proposed 2003-2004 budget represents 
        a response to the unpredictable state of the national economy, Mills describes 
        it as &quot;an optimistic budget that really supports what this College 
        is about.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        In order to secure funding for academic and financial aid programs, which 
        Mills cites as essential to the College's core mission, $1.3-1.5 million 
        must be cut from operating costs before the start of the coming fiscal 
        year. Though the College aims to eliminate 25-30 positions, this does 
        not necessarily translate into the 25-30 layoffs. The College will examine 
        all possibilities in reducing positions, including the option of leaving 
        current vacancies unfilled.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees was made aware of the 
        possibility of layoffs, and the potential for reductions to various campus 
        services, at their regularly scheduled meeting in Boston last Friday. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        As the Executive Committee expressed support for these initiatives, it 
        is likely that the full Board will approve the proposed 2003-2004 budget 
        which requires position and program reduction when they convene on February 
        7. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Though official notification of job termination will not occur until after 
        the anticipated approval of the budget, affected employees could receive 
        informal notification as early as next week. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Decisions pertaining to layoffs will be made by senior administrators 
        working with department directors, though final discretion rests in the 
        hands of five members of the administration: Dean of Student Affairs Craig 
        Bradley, Senior Vice President of Finance and Administration and Treasurer 
        Katy Longley, Dean for Academic Affairs Craig McEwen, Dean of Admissions 
        and Financial Aid Jim Miller, and Senior Vice President for Planning and 
        Administration and Chief Development Officer Bill Torrey. </p>
      <p align="left">
        According to Torrey, &quot;cuts will be program based,&quot; which means 
        that cuts will not be based upon the performance of individuals. </p>
      <p align="left">
        As stated in a press release dated January 22, &quot;Eligible employees 
        who do lose their jobs will receive eight weeks of severance pay plus 
        one additional week of pay for each year of service up to 26 weeks of 
        pay. The College will also provide affected employees with an amount equal 
        to the cost of two months of health and dental insurance and job counseling.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite the apparent suddenness of the announcement of intentions to eliminate 
        positions, members of the Bowdoin community have known of the financial 
        state of the College for some time. With endowment returns lower than 
        expected and the additional burden of raised taxes and rising utility 
        costs, the College is forced to re-evaluate the allocation of its resources. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;It would be a major mistake to mortgage the future,&quot; said Mills.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Top administrators stress the necessity of these measures in order to 
        maintain the quality of the student experience. Funding for academic programs 
        and financial aid will remain untouched, and the restoration of the Chapel 
        towers and the groundbreaking for Kanbar Hall remain scheduled to begin 
        in March. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Under the proposed 2003-2004 budget, funding for major maintenance will 
        increase by approximately three percent, and administrators and support 
        staff will receive a modest increase in pay.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Student jobs will not be in jeopardy, as Manager of Employment and Human 
        Resources Services Kim Bonsey predicts the creation of more on-campus 
        jobs for students.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The last round of layoffs conducted by the College spanned from 1991 to 
        1994, eliminating the jobs of 69 individuals. </p>
