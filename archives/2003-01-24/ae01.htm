      <p align="left">Despite the busy flurry of starting classes, a select group 
        of Bowdoin students did manage to attend to the memory of a great figure 
        not only in American History but also in Human History. He was a man who 
        was able to see beyond petty day-to-day troubles and turn his own eyes 
        - and the eyes of a nation - towards greater and more magnanimous goals. 
        For those of you who let the day go by without remembering, Monday, January 
        20 was Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.</p>
      <p align="left">
        In Pickard Theater, performances by the Poeting club, a talk by Phil Hansen 
        ('64), and a solo performance by Kimberly Johnson (06) pulled together 
        the spirit of King's vision. Janelle Charles (06) began the evening with 
        opening comments. Moved to tears by the indescribable nature and implications 
        of the day of remembrance, Charles noted that, at times &quot;we forget 
        that the fight is not over.&quot; By her very tone, Charles demanded the 
        attention of the audience. If any attendee had come feeling indifferent 
        to the day, Charles' comments erased this indifference. &quot;This day 
        means something to me&quot; she said, &quot;let it mean something to you 
        as well.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alkhaaliq Bashir (05) carried on Charles' energy in his performance piece. 
        One phrase seemed to sum up the passion behind his message: &quot;what 
        do I want&#133;I want freedom.&quot; Bashir commented afterwards that 
        Poeting employs &quot;activism, poetry and other aspects of performance 
        to bring awareness and attention to the effects and existence of discrimination 
        and other political ideas.&quot; In terms of King specifically, Bashir 
        commented that this figurehead of the Civil Rights movement &quot;gives 
        me a continuous flow of inspiration for poetry and conduct. I used to 
        be the one ready to throw a fist but after it just made more sense to 
        talk out differences if possible.&quot; Martin Luther King Jr. day is 
        &quot;a day to recharge our passion&quot; and &quot;to better our country 
        by coming closer to racial equality.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like Bashir, Michael Chan (05), another Poeter, commented that he thought 
        that &quot;the event was very successful yet it lacked the attendance 
        that it had last year.&quot; However, Chan also commented that he aspires 
        to affect people deeply and that numbers do not matter. Whether it is 
        one person or the kind of crowds that King spoke to, Chan is satisfied 
        being a part of the process of making people aware of the fight that still 
        continues on today against discrimination. On the other hand, Chan did 
        note that &quot;the subtleties that have become so characteristic of racism 
        in America&quot; are, in some ways, far more dangerous than the open forms 
        of discrimination that people faced in the 1960's. &quot;For one,&quot; 
        said Chan, &quot;they are far easier to ignore.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Phil Hansen (64), an alumnus of Bowdoin College gave a historical perspective 
        to the Poeters' performances. With his anecdotes about participating in 
        a student exchange program with a historically black college, Morehouse 
        college, he added substance to the passion of the celebration thus far. 
        During the exchange, Hansen participated in a picket line among black 
        students. As the only white protesting, he was singled out by an angry 
        white man in the surrounding crowd who screamed into his face &quot;nigger 
        lover.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        It was at this point, said Hansen, that he made a conscience decision 
        to claim a moral standpoint and to stand firmly behind it. He called such 
        moments as these &quot;Huck Fin moments,&quot; in reference to one of 
        Mark Twain's fictional characters who decided that he would rather go 
        to hell than turn his friend in as a runaway slave. Hansen noted that 
        &quot;all of us grow up at some point and each of us has a Huck moment.&quot; 
        For him, it was facing up to the angry mob member and not being afraid 
        anymore.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The evening concluded with a solo performance by Kimberly Johnson who 
        sang with heart wrenching fervor. A reception followed in Drake Lobby 
        and a Discussion Group met in the Caf&eacute; Lounge of David Saul Smith 
        Union following the Campus Celebration. </p>
