        <font size="2">KATHERINE CRANE</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> George W. Bush, master of unintentional irony, has declared 
        Sunday, January 19 to be &quot;Sanctity of Human Life Day.&quot; Were 
        it not for the day's oh-so-coincidental placement three days before the 
        anniversary of Roe v. Wade, it might be tempting to wonder what human 
        life Bush could possibly be thinking of.</p>
      <p>But no, this is just another unneeded signal that with the blessing of 
        the religious right, Bush intends to do all he can to overturn Roe vs. 
        Wade. And there is no point in speculating about any other meanings that 
        might be attached to the day, because it is fairly evident that the life 
        of a fetus (or unborn child, as the anti-abortion people insist on calling 
        it) is the only life that Bush really considers to be valuable.</p>
      <p>First of all, it should really be &quot;Sanctity of American Life Day,&quot; 
        since Bush obviously has no qualms about killing, say, Iraqis, whether 
        they happen to be old, young or unborn. Even American fetuses grow up 
        to be people, though, so let's take a look at just how sacred the unwanted 
        but unaborted fetus is after it leaves the womb.</p>
      <p>There is a good chance these days that a woman who has an unwanted pregnancy 
        will be poor. Since our government does not support the kind of welfare 
        that would allow her to take care of her child without working, she will 
        be forced to go back to work as soon as she can after giving birth. Odds 
        are there won't be a husband to help her out, and the child will either 
        come along to the mother's job, or stay with whoever is handy.</p>
      <p>This will continue until the child is old enough to go to public school. 
        But since Bush would rather give tax money back to the rich than spend 
        it on the poor, public schools don't have the money to offer a very good 
        education. Maybe this child (let's say she's female) will have one extraordinary 
        teacher, who will inspire her to spend hours in the library learning on 
        her own, to take all the hard classes that are offered and to ace them 
        all, while working to earn the money and win the scholarships to put herself 
        through college.</p>
      <p>But chances are against that happening. More likely, she will be one 
        of the children who, having neither parents who can instruct her nor teachers 
        who can afford to pay special attention to her, simply floats through 
        school without learning much of anything. If she is abused at home, as 
        frequently happens to unwanted children who are seen as financial burdens, 
        this will certainly lessen her chances of success.<br>
        <br>
        When this child gets sick, as children do, who's going to pay her medical 
        bills? Not George W. Bush. And what if, like her mother before her, she 
        gets pregnant at a young age? If Bush has his way, there won't be any 
        legal way for her to get an abortion. </p>
      <p>If, however, she is determined not to keep the child, there will be only 
        a few options for her. She can carry the baby to term and give it up for 
        adoption, but this would probably mean dropping out of high school. Her 
        other choices are to have an illegal and probably dangerous backstreet 
        abortion, or to perform an abortion on herself which might well result 
        in her death.</p>
      <p>All this can happen, not because Bush believes in the sanctity of human 
        life, but because he doesn't. To the religious right, a baby in the womb 
        is a powerful symbol. Once that baby leaves the womb, they couldn't care 
        less what happens to it.<br>
