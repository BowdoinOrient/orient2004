      It's a new year, and once again we all promise ourselves that this will 
      be the year we will rid our lives of bad habits. We're going to get in shape, 
      get over the ex, study more, or quit smoking. While all of these are great 
      ideas, those who make these routine resolutions often lose steam quickly. 
      Then we feel like failures, and when we're ringing in 2004 we'll be making 
      the same promises. This year, make a new resolution and kick the tired promises 
      to the curb. Everyone listens to music, so why not make your resolution 
      to listen to more? More music = happier you. Finally, a resolution that 
      is both beneficial and feasible: an eight-step regimen to a melodious 2003. 
      <p align="left">
      1. Make a list. Sit down and think of all those CDs you've wanted for so 
      long and for some reason haven't gotten around to purchasing. What feeling 
      is worse than thinking, &quot;I'm really in the mood for (insert much loved 
      band name here), too bad I didn't think to buy it.&quot; You rummage through 
      your CD collection hoping for something to satisfy your urge, but it's hopeless. 
      You get pissed and cranky and sulk for the rest of the night. The album 
      now sits at the top of your list. </p>
      <p align="left">
      2. Edit your collection. Haven't listened to it in years? Then put it in 
      the Bull Moose pile. They buy your old Whitney Houston's, and you get money 
      to buy The Liars-more than a fair deal.</p>
      <p align="left">
      3. Share. Introduce people in your house or dorm to your music. There are 
      several possible benefits to this gratuity. Firstly, they might get hooked 
      on music you really like. Then, when you visit them, you can relax instead 
      of feeling like you need half a bottle of Advil from hearing too much Nelly. 
      Another benefit of sharing might be that they have a secret to let you onto 
      as well. There is more music being made in the world than can be imagined-how 
      much do you think actually makes its way to every Bowdoin student? It's 
      a shame. </p>
      <p align="left">
      4. Use your computer. If money doesn't grow on trees for you, steps four 
      and five provide wonderful alternatives. Not only does downloading music 
      save you cash, it also lets you listen to a band before you fork over the 
      fiftenn bucks. Take a break from your papers, surf indie label websites 
      and give their bands a listen. </p>
      <p align="left">
      5. Set radio to WBOR. Unless you like junior high pop or country, Maine 
      radio stations are slim pickings. Never fear, WBOR is right here. Some of 
      Bowdoin's biggest music fans share their knowledge and music that you're 
      not going to hear on Clear Channel stations. Not to mention, if you're not 
      into the fusion jazz you hear when you turn BOR on, just wait an hour and 
      it might be followed by hip hop, or drum and bass, or Australian indie rock, 
      or&#133; Ah, something for everyone.</p>
      <p align="left">
      6. See live music! Granted seeing a live band in Brunswick means three bald 
      men playing Springsteen covers, but Portland and Boston aren't all far away. 
      Checkout the listings, find a show, recruit musical friend(s), go.</p>
      <p align="left">
      7. Splurge. I realize this is not the most economically conservative of 
      suggestions, especially after coughing up $300 for books. But forgo dinner 
      out with friends and buy music. You can either buy the album you listed 
      in step number 1, or, for the more daring Bowdoin student, surprise yourself. 
      Take a suggestion from a reliable friend, or a trusted magazine, and buy 
      a band's album you know nothing (or very little) about. What's the worst 
      that could happen? You could hate it and be out of a little cash. But maybe 
      you'd find a new love&#133; What a rush.</p>
      <p align="left">
      8. Open up. While all of these steps are to enhance your musical collection, 
      expanding musical horizons is also crucial. If you're a folk fan, listen 
      to some rap. If you're a punk fan, check out some gospel. No one says you 
      have to like it, but at least you can say you tried.</p>
      <p align="left">
      Resolutions always seem to be about adding something new to your life, or 
      taking something out completely, this way you can just enhance what's already 
      prevalent. Now you'll have an album for every occasion and, finally, a resolution 
      you actually kept. Come December, maybe you'll still smoke a pack a day 
      and be a C student, but just think of all the musical prowess you'll have 
      gained.
