        <font size="2">PAT ROCKEFELLER</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As U.S. forces mass on the borders of Iraq, the tirade 
        of anti-war sloganeering continues, questioning the legitimacy of action, 
        particularly concerning inconsistencies in policy between Iraq and North 
        Korea. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The argument goes something like, &quot;Well, if we are going to invade 
        Iraq for trying to get nukes, why not North Korea, since it already has 
        them, and is planning on making more?&quot; This pathetic jab from the 
        anti-war crowd is just far too weak to be repeated as often as it is, 
        in many cases by otherwise intelligent people. </p>
      <p align="left">
        At the most basic level the answer is &quot;because North Korea already 
        has nuclear weapons.&quot; The most fundamental reason behind the invasion 
        of Iraq is to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is important 
        to act now, before the Butcher of Baghdad has the chance to build one, 
        because once he does, the stakes of invasion are dramatically increased. 
        The world faces very narrow options with North Korea precisely because 
        it is a nuclear state, and no serious person actually thinks we should 
        invade. </p>
      <p align="left">
        A nuclear armed opponent limits the options of the U.S., U.N., and the 
        rest of the world. Were Saddam Hussein in control of nukes, he could run 
        rampant around the Middle East with impunity. Some claim deterrence would 
        work for Iraq as it did for the Soviet Union. This is shortsighted. First 
        off, a new cold war is hardly an appealing thought. Secondly, Hussein 
        is a gambler, and he would be right to gamble. If he had nukes, and re-invaded 
        Kuwait or Iran, what would the U.S. do? Nothing. We would not be willing 
        to risk a nuclear exchange. In fact, we could use ours in response, but 
        it would be nice to have a solution to the problem that wasn't dependent 
        upon our turning Baghdad into a glow in the dark tomb. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are of course other factors to consider as well. North Korea has 
        other strong states surrounding it that can put pressure on it to act 
        responsibly-China, its closest proximity to an ally, is a good example. 
        There are no similar states in the Middle East to keep a nuclear Iraq 
        in check, and the United Nations has proven itself quite incapable or 
        unwilling to play the role it set out for itself at the end of the Gulf 
        War. </p>
      <p align="left">
        So, is the President's foreign policy inconsistent? Of course. Just as 
        it should be. Whoever said foreign policy had to be consistent was a fool. 
        The idea of always using force or never using force, regardless of the 
        situation is absurd. Indeed, after the President's much maligned &quot;Axis 
        of Evil&quot; statement most pundits worried that the President was coloring 
        three very different countries exactly the same. They said that they each 
        needed to be treated differently in accordance with the particular problems 
        each country posed and faced. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Now that the President has done just that-treating each case individually-many 
        of the same are shouting that it's unfair to invade Iraq, but not Korea, 
        or for that matter China, Pakistan, Israel, etc. Unfair indeed. This is 
        a child's argument. Bobby gets to stay up later, why not me? North Korea 
        gets to develop nuclear weapons, why not Iraq? </p>
      <p align="left">
        The idea that the President may actually understand these complexities 
        never seems to occur to his critics. Either he does not know he has to 
        treat different countries differently, or he is treating them differently 
        for selfish reasons (oil and dad). In reality, he has handled the Axis 
        of Evil regimes in the most appropriate manner possible. Iraq will be 
        confronted with the military, North Korea with diplomacy, and the people 
        of Iran will be encouraged to revolt against their leaders. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Of course most people who use the &quot;inconsistency&quot; argument are 
        not actually calling for an invasion of North Korea. On the contrary, 
        they are trying to cast doubt on the validity of action in Iraq. Fine. 
        But one must wonder what audience they are appealing to with this miserable 
        argument, and in what low esteem they must consider this audience if they 
        count on them not being able to reason a difference between the two scenarios.
