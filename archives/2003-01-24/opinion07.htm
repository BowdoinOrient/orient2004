        <font size="2">BENJAMIN KREIDER</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In typical Republican fashion, President George W. Bush 
        has proposed a second tax cut in two years. He alleges that lower taxes 
        will stimulate the nation's ailing economy and create thousands of jobs. 
        Perhaps Bush has forgotten that he made the same promise when the last 
        tax cut passed, yet the nation's economy has still not improved.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush feels that the proposed $674 billion tax cut will spur consumer and 
        business spending and create jobs. As part of the plan, taxes on stock 
        dividends will be eliminated, and small businesses will be able to deduct 
        more money from their taxes. In fact, half the tax cut comes from the 
        elimination of taxes on dividends. In other words, the plan greatly benefits 
        the wealthy Americans who already reaped the rewards of Bush's last tax 
        cut.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The elimination of dividend taxes is another clear example of the Bush 
        administration's coziness with the wealthy. The President himself told 
        reporters that &quot;It's a plan that's good for all Americans.&quot; 
        Yet millions of poor Americans cannot even afford to put food on the table, 
        let alone purchase stock. How would such a tax cut help them?</p>
      <p align="left">
        Increasing the cap on small businesses tax deduction does not help the 
        poor, either. This is just another initiative that the administration 
        has developed to help the same business community that largely financed 
        Bush's campaign. In addition, the White House claims the new tax plan 
        will give small business owners an average tax cut of over $2,000. The 
        Urban Institute-Brookings Institution, however, found that the majority 
        of small businesses would actually save only about $500.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush has gotten economists from various universities and the Federal Reserve 
        Board to endorse his plan, hoping this will increase public support for 
        the cut. How is this supposed to assuage the fears of Americans who don't 
        support the tax cut? Economists are notoriously conservative, both those 
        at universities and in the private sector. No economist with any amount 
        of sense would actually oppose the president's plan to his face.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Both Bush and his economist buddies seem to ignore the massive budget 
        deficits that have built up in the past several years. The President's 
        budget director admitted that the federal budget deficit will continue 
        into the &quot;foreseeable future.&quot; He also said that the shortfalls 
        will be far greater than the $200 billion to $300 billion projected for 
        this fiscal year and the following one. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Let's get this straight: The deficit is getting bigger, yet Bush thinks 
        it is a priority to cut taxes? Cutting taxes will decrease the federal 
        government's revenue, exacerbating already huge deficits. The timing is 
        particularly bad, as the country is preparing for a likely war in Iraq 
        that will cost billions of dollars. The simultaneous large tax cut, massive 
        budget deficits, and increase in defense spending occurred before and 
        during the Reagan era. Reaganomics, of course, resulted in a recession 
        in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If members of the Bush administration really paid attention to history, 
        they would realize how foolish this tax plan really is. They would understand 
        that it is a pipe dream to simultaneously cut taxes and increase spending. 
        Yet the administration is advocating huge increases in defense spending 
        and an overall four percent jump in spending next year.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Many on Capitol Hill believe that the plan will not pass. Democratic Senator 
        John Breaux of Louisiana, who backed Bush's last tax cut, believes the 
        measure will not pass. Even Republican Finance Committee Chairman Charles 
        Grassley maintains this same view.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This measure will mainly help the wealthy, not everyone, as Bush claims. 
        Not even those who favored the last tax cut believe this one will pass. 
        The current proposal is unlikely to pass, so it must be reconsidered. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Whatever happened to Bush's philosophy of compassionate conservatism? 
        It seems these days that he only shows compassion towards the wealthy 
        and the business community, hardly parties that deserve compassion.</p>
