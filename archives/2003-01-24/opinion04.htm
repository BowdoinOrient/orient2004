        <font size="2">JAMES BAUMBERGER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> In a Martin Luther King Day address on racial equality, 
        President Bush said that &quot;even though progress has been made there's 
        more to do.&quot; Since the Trent Lott catastrophe, Republicans have promised 
        to do more to make minorities a priority in national policy. However, 
        we have seen in recent weeks that the Bush Administration is doing little 
        to combat racial inequality.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The Lott scandal was a giant misstep for the Republican leadership. The 
        controversy emerged following Senator Trent Lott's comments expressing 
        regret that segregationist candidate Senator Strom Thurmond was not elected 
        president in 1948.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A series of increasingly remorseful apologies and an appearance on Black 
        Entertainment Television were not enough to quell the relentless media 
        coverage. The incident and subsequent reaction played as the top news 
        story for two weeks. By the time Lott resigned his leadership post, the 
        damage had already been done.</p>
      <p align="left">
        While President Bush attempted to keep his distance, his failure to call 
        for Lott's resignation spoke for itself. He denounced Lott's remarks, 
        yet had no public qualms about the ability of a racist to perform the 
        duties of Republican leader in the Senate.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Only days after Lott's racist blunder, Republican Congressman Cass Ballenger 
        told the press that he despised a certain black congresswoman so much 
        that he had &quot;segregationist feelings.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Ballenger and Lott, by the way, are both still in office.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Surely only a small number of elected Republicans are racist, but in order 
        to convince the nation that their party stands for all people, the Republicans 
        will need to adopt a no-tolerance policy when it comes to the racist views 
        of its elected officials. Tolerance, we know, is a tacit form of acceptance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A more conciliatory tone emerged from the Republican leadership following 
        the Lott debacle. But after promises to pursue minority-friendly policy, 
        recent political developments reflect a not-so-changed party.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite massive opposition from the black community, the newly elected 
        Republican governor of Georgia is planning on offering a referendum to 
        reinstate the old state flag. If the measure is passed, the new flag would 
        be set aside in deference to the old one, which boasts a significantly 
        larger image of the Confederate flag.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Also surprising was the President's re-nomination of conservative judge 
        Charles Pickering to the federal bench. His previous nomination failed 
        last year after strong opposition to his stance on civil rights. Pickering 
        is opposed by both the NAACP and the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Lastly, the Bush Administration signed on to a Supreme Court case that 
        seeks to challenge the affirmative action program at the University of 
        Michigan. Colin Powell, the highest ranking African American in the administration 
        has publicly expressed his disagreement with the decision. Bush's decision 
        would not be so egregious if his administration was otherwise seriously 
        committed to providing equal opportunity for all.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Politically speaking, African-American support is not essential to a Republican's 
        chances of reelection. After all, only 9 percent of blacks voted for Bush 
        in the 2000 election.</p>
      <p align="left">
        More important, however, are the non-minorities who view racial issues 
        as important. Many of these voters will not vote for a candidate if they 
        feel he does not serve the best interests of the nation's minorities. 
        The Republicans will risk alienating these voters if they do not hold 
        true to their promises.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking to the 2004 presidential race, the Republican effort to hold on 
        to their already small support from minorities will be tougher if Sen. 
        Joe Lieberman wins the Democratic nomination. Currently the front runner 
        among the large contingent of Democrats seeking the nod, Lieberman seems 
        to have inherited the Clinton-Gore popularity among blacks. Unless the 
        policy direction starts to change, race could be a defining issue in 2004.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bush and his colleagues now face a test. We will find out exactly how 
        important achieving racial equality is to the &quot;Party of Lincoln.&quot; 
        They will be graded on their success, or lack thereof, in the next election.<br>
