        </font></p>
      <p align="left">While I was listening to Ryan Adams' debut solo album, <i>Heartbreaker</i>, 
        I kept thinking of John Cusack's opening monologue from one of the greatest 
        music movies ever, High Fidelity. Cusack's character intuitively observes 
        that pop music (pop music in the broad sense, not N'Sync), rather than 
        being happy and full of bubblegum, is more often than not quite depressing, 
        with &quot;literally thousands upon thousands of songs&quot; about love, 
        unrequited love, pain, loss, and heartbreak. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="right">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/ae02_adams.jpg" width="250" height="188"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Adam's debut album, <i>Heartbreaker</i>, incorporates 
            elements of blues, country and rock to create a soulful collection 
            of love songs. (<a href="http://www.mtv.com">mtv.com</a>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">This album, the first from the former front man of the alt-country 
        band Whiskeytown, is perhaps the ultimate in the catalogue of depressing 
        pop albums, although some may not consider Adams pop. Adams, who wrote 
        most of <i>Heartbreaker</i> directly after a difficult breakup with his 
        girlfriend, fills the album with some of the saddest songs I have ever 
        heard. On &quot;Why Do They Leave,&quot; Adams sings, &quot;Oh, why do 
        they leave, on the day that you needed them the most.&quot; Songs such 
        as &quot;AMY,&quot; &quot;call me on your way back home,&quot; and &quot;come 
        pick me up,&quot; just drip with sadness, with Adams often issuing lines 
        like &quot;I love you Amy, do you still love me?&quot; and &quot;I just 
        want to die without you, honey that ain't nothing new.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Admittedly, Adams is at times quite self-indulgent, and 
        perhaps he writes one or two too many songs dealing with the same issue, 
        but the emotion he puts into his lyrics, and his understated guitar playing, 
        indicate that his sincerity should not be questioned. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even so, if every song on this album was about his lost 
        love and his heartbreak, this album might not have succeeded. Adams demonstrates 
        his considerable ability to write in the voice of someone else, a Dylanesque 
        talent that has been sorely missing from more recent musicians, with the 
        notable exception of Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. Perhaps the most touching 
        song on the album is &quot;In My Time of Need,&quot; where Adams assumes 
        the character of a poor old farmer singing to his wife during a drought 
        that has left them without food or money. &quot;Damn, Sam (I love a woman 
        that rains),&quot; &quot;Bartering Lines,&quot; and &quot;Shakedown on 
        9th Street&quot; see Adams' writing from many different perspectives.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">From his own perspective too, Adams writes at times with 
        surprising diversity. On &quot;To Be The One,&quot; Adams considers the 
        feelings of a woman who has left him. &quot;And I don't know which is 
        worse, to wake up and see the sun, or to be the one, that's gone.&quot; 
        Oh My Sweet Carolina is the musical centerpiece to Heartbreaker, and Adams 
        sings not about lost love, but about his home, tracking his journey around 
        the country. The great country singer Emmy Lou Harris sings haunting backup 
        vocals on the track. Adams' lyrical talent is considerable, but it is 
        the music that surrounds the words that really make one sit up and take 
        notice.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Adams is, rightfully or not, placed in the &quot;Alt-Country&quot; 
        category of music. I must say I think that is a stupid label and has no 
        right even existing. He does have a lot of country influence, but it is 
        not the type of country that one would hear on the radio stations around 
        Brunswick. His music is nothing new, and recalls early acoustic blues, 
        the beginnings on Rock n' Roll, and country folk singers, people like 
        Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan. Many of his songs are simply 
        Adams' plain, warm voice, and his simple but delicate guitar. This, and 
        his rough harmonica again recall Dylan. The difference is that Adams can 
        sing. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Like his lyrics, Adams shows a surprising amount of musical 
        diversity. He is able to write soft, lyrical ballads, and also hard, tough 
        as a nails blues-country tunes, such as &quot;Bartering Lines.&quot; &quot;To 
        Be Young (is to be sad, is to be high) and &quot;Shakedown on 9th Street 
        show that Adams has no problem rocking out. Musically though, some of 
        the songs do become slightly repetitive. I found it difficult to attentively 
        sit through the entire album several times. The danger in the simplicity 
        Adams' strives for is repetition, and this album is a little bit long 
        winded, but the songs are short enough to not be too exhausting.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the weaknesses of this album, it will be remembered 
        as a classic, a piece of work inspired by that traditional muse of pop 
        music; heartbreak. Adams has since released another album, <i>Gold</i>, 
        but before you listen to that (and you have probably already heard his 
        single from it, &quot;New York, New York), listen to Heartbreaker. It 
        is overflowing with raw emotion and musical beauty, and it will break 
        your heart. </p>
