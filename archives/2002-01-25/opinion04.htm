        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>In the weeks and months that followed the events of September 11, it 
        was difficult to turn on the TV or open a newspaper without Donald Rumsfeld 
        or George Bush assuring me that U.S. Special Forces would capture Osama 
        bin Laden. They were very emphatic about this; whether it was Bush speaking 
        from a convenience store in Crawford, Texas, or Rumsfeld from a podium 
        in Washington, D.C., the message was clear: &quot;We'll get bin Laden.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>I was, and still am, convinced that we will never find bin Laden. I also 
        feel that our government's strong rhetoric served only to mythologize 
        a man who I would rather forget. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Originally, I passed off the irrational pipedream of catching bin Laden 
        in an area-most of Afghanistan and its border region with Pakistan-which 
        is as lawless and unregulated as any on earth, as just that: an irrational 
        pipedream. But I have recently realized that Bush and his cronies are 
        not that stupid. In fact, I believe the opposite to be true. Bush surely 
        is not a well-spoken or extremely intelligent man, but he is a shrewd 
        businessman with a keen political sense that allows him to pursue his 
        conservative agenda within the workings of our American political system. 
        Bush understands how political relationships work, the earliest proof 
        of this being his defeat of the immensely popular Ann Richards in the 
        1992 race for Texas governor. He won the race largely because of his ability 
        to rally popular Texas Democrats to his side.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Giving Bush the benefit of the doubt, or at least accepting that he understands 
        how to play the political game, led me to understand his comments in regard 
        to bin Laden's capture as a public relations campaign designed to calm 
        the shaken American people and reassure them that the U.S. would stop 
        at nothing to eliminate evil from the planet. As innocuous as this may 
        seem, I fear that it will have lasting policy implications as our government 
        moves its focus away from Afghanistan and reshapes its anti-terrorism 
        agenda. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Like any public-relations campaign, &quot;We'll get bin Laden&quot; came 
        and went. What is left is a country full of people seeking retribution 
        for a horrible act and once again believing that America represents inherent 
        good in pursuit of pure evil. Again, putting a little faith in Bush or 
        at least the hawkish political players he has surrounded himself with, 
        I find it hard to believe that officials in the White House and Pentagon 
        ever genuinely believed that bin Laden would be captured. Instead, I see 
        the reinvention of evil, rather then a clear articulation of actual policy 
        and governmental goals, as the primary motivation for the consistent mention 
        of bin Laden and his impending capture.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I find it hard to argue that Osama bin Laden is not evil. He trained 
        men to carry out a mission designed to kill as many innocent civilians 
        as possible-if that's not evil, then I really don't know what is. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Still, just because bin Laden is evil, I don't think that those who oppose 
        him are inherently &quot;good.&quot; This is the dichotomy that Bush and 
        Rumsfeld's rhetoric continues to create. Not since communist Russia was 
        dissolved and democratized has the American government faced an enemy 
        as recognizable and contemptible as bin Laden. In many ways, the fall 
        of the USSR signified the death of evil in foreign policy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Consequently, this ended our government's ability to assume the role 
        of &quot;good guy&quot; simply by default. A dichotomy does not stand 
        up without both its prongs. It is far more difficult to assure 270 million 
        Americans that you are acting in the name of justice and good when your 
        actions are not juxtaposed by those of a force generally regarded as evil.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The foreign policy &quot;blank check&quot; that formed our opposition 
        to the inherent evils of communism has been absent since communism fell 
        in the early '90s, and who would be more aware of this than Bush and his 
        team of unilateral Cold War thugs? Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, John 
        Ashcroft, and the rest of Bush's cabinet are all keenly aware of the political 
        benefits of having an enemy who exists but cannot be eliminated in any 
        definitive way. They have to know that we will never catch bin Laden, 
        but they think that to express this to the American people isn't an option. 
        Instead, the current administration will use the search for bin Laden 
        and the pure evil he represents as leverage in pursuit of its conservative 
        agenda.</p>
