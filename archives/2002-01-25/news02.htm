      <p align="left">Due to the whims of the calendar, one often finds Martin 
        Luther King Day at the end of Bowdoin's winter break. This year, though, 
        the first day of classes ended with students filling Pickard Theater to 
        listen to speeches and hear music commemorating what would have been the 
        civil rights leader's 73rd birthday.<br>

      </table>
      <p align="left">The keynote speaker for Monday's program was Robert Johnson 
        '71, the head of the Africana Studies Department at the University of 
        Massachusetts at Boston. Johnson, whose recent scholarship has addressed 
        the issue of government reparations for slavery, as well as repatriation 
        in Africa, spoke on the parallels between present-day civil rights struggles 
        and those of King's time. Johnson addressed the Enron debacle, the war 
        in Afghanistan, and debt relief for developing nations, and argued that 
        King would disapprove of how the U.S. has addressed these problems. Johnson 
        spoke at one point of &quot;the callous attitude of the Bush administration 
        towards the world.&quot; He also touched on last summer's United Nations 
        Conference on Racism in South Africa.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Johnson also drew connections between the life of King and 
        that of John Brown Russworm, Bowdoin's first black graduate, in the early 
        19th century. He reminded the audience that King himself had visited Brunswick 
        and Bowdoin in 1964, months before his reception of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
        A short video produced by the College included alumni anecdotes of King's 
        visit, in which he spoke on campus and held a discussion session with 
        students in Maine Lounge. &quot;We were a college of white men with little 
        concern for the world around us,&quot; Steve Munger '65 said in the video, 
        &quot;but gradually that changed as the next four years unfolded.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The program also included segments from the PBS documentary 
        <i>Eyes on the Prize</i>, a solo piano performance by Associate Professor 
        of Music Robert Greenlee, an original poem spoken by Ramona Pina '05, 
        and performances by the Chamber Choir.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Wil Smith '00, Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs, 
        emceed Monday's event and said he was glad to see more attendance than 
        usual. Smith pointed out that since classes were alredy in session on 
        the day of the holiday, the event was placed in a larger venue than in 
        past years. &quot;Bowdoin often gets a bad rap for being apathetic about 
        issues of race and civil rights,&quot; Smith said. &quot;We might feel, 
        at times, removed.&quot; But, Smith said, the turnout and response to 
        Monday's event suggested otherwise.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Next week, the African-American Society will bring to campus 
        another famous civil rights figure. James Meredith, the first black student 
        to attend the University of Mississippi in 1962, will speak at Common 
        Hour on February 1. Meredith participated in civil rights marches throughout 
        the 1960s, but by the 1980s had moved toward a more conservative political 
        stance and worked for Republican North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms from 
        1989 to 1991.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kijan Bloomfield, president of the African-American Society, 
        said that a member from Mississippi knew Meredith, who expressed an interest 
        in speaking at Bowdoin. Other events in February, National Black History 
        Month, include the semiformal Ebony Ball on February 16 and the Black 
        Arts Festival on February 21. <br>
