      <p align="left"><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: What's the story with food allergies? 
        Are they more common- or more dangerous- than they used to be? -JRW</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Dear JRW: Although a great many people believe themselves 
        to be allergic to certain foods, studies show that only 6 percent of children 
        and 1 or 2 percent of adults actually have true food allergies. True allergies 
        involve an immune reaction to specific proteins. Other non-allergic reactions 
        to food include food intolerances (from a lack of digestive enzymes, such 
        as lactose intolerance), reactions to food additives (like MSG), or naturally 
        occurring food components (like tyramine in cheese), or actual food poisoning 
        (caused by microbes contained in the food and not the food itself). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In an allergic reaction to food, certain cells in the gastrointestinal 
        tract (mast cells) release chemical mediators (especially histamines) 
        which induce local, and sometimes systemic, allergic symptoms. Initially, 
        these symptoms might include transient itching and swelling of the lips, 
        mouth or throat. When the offending food passes into the stomach and intestines, 
        however, nausea, vomiting, cramping pain, abdominal distention and diarrhea 
        may result. Allergic reactions to food can also cause hives, swelling 
        of the hands or feet, or an asthma attack. Rarely, food allergies can 
        result in anaphylaxis: extreme shortness of breath, heart beat irregularities, 
        and, if untreated, shock and ultimately death.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most people with food allergies are allergic to fewer than 
        4 foods. The most common adult food allergens are peanuts, tree nuts (like 
        walnuts or almonds), fish and shellfish. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Allergic symptoms generally develop within minutes to 2 
        hours after eating, but may vary greatly depending on the manner in which 
        the food was prepared, the amount consumed, and what else was also eaten 
        during the same meal. For these reasons, foods suspected of being allergens 
        may fail to provoke consistent allergic reactions. Food allergies are 
        diagnosed through selective hypersensitivity skin testing or &quot;RAST&quot; 
        allergy blood tests or through placebo-controlled food challenges or dietary 
        restrictions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At present, there is no cure for food allergies. Avoidance 
        is the only way to prevent an allergic reaction. Sometimes, that can be 
        more difficult than one might expect. For instance, some &quot;artificial&quot; 
        nuts, like mandelonas, are sold as peanut substitutes, but in fact are 
        themselves just peanuts that have been deflavored and then reflavored 
        (with almond oil, in the case of mandelonas). They are just as potently 
        allergenic as natural peanuts. Fish-allergic people can react to non-fish 
        food that has been unknowingly contaminated by a spatula, cooking oil 
        or grill previously exposed to fish. Worcestershire sauce usually contains 
        anchovies.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anaphylactic allergic reactions must be treated promptly 
        with epinephrine. People with a history of severe food allergies should 
        always carry a couple of Epipens and should also wear a Medicalert bracelet. 
        Anaphylactic reactions cannot be reliably prevented by taking antihistamines 
        before eating, nor by inducing vomiting after food has been ingested. 
        Those at risk should take epinephrine as soon as they suspect they have 
        eaten a problem food or feel a reaction starting. Even if the reaction 
        is stopped by the epinephrine, they should be transported immediately 
        to the nearest Emergency Room for further evaluation and observation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It may not have been scientifically demonstrated (at least 
        yet), but it certainly seems that food allergies are more common nowadays. 
        This may be a result of the innumerable chemical manipulations of our 
        food that take place commercially (everything from the genetic modification 
        of crops to the addition of beef extracts to McDonald's fries). It has 
        been clearly shown, however, that the most effective primary prevention 
        of food allergies comes from extended breast feeding of infants and then 
        delaying and moderating their introduction to table foods.<br>
