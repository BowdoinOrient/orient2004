      <p>Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey has never seen a season quite like this. After 
        14 games (including a three game road trip over winter break to Minnesota) 
        the Bears stand at 13-1; the only loss was at the hands of the undefeated, 
        top-ranked Middlebury Panthers. This is the best start ever for the team 
        and they have maintained a #2 ranking in the National Poll since early 
        in the season. The season grinds on, but the Polar Bears keep winning.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Leading scorer on the team Shelly Chessie ('03) says, &quot;We are peaking 
        at the right time.&quot; Indeed, the entire season seems to have been 
        a peak thus far. Chessie attributes the success to &quot;a group of solid 
        individuals who combine to make a great team, moreso than any other year 
        in my career here. There is absolutely no weaklink.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The highlight of the winter break was the team's trip to Minnesota. There, 
        they faced competetion from St. Thomas (Minn.), Wisconsin-River Falls 
        (tied for 10th nationally), and Gustavus Adolphus (ranked 5th nationally). 
        Each matchup lead to a 4-3 win for Bowdoin. The games were &quot;challenging 
        and full of tough competition,&quot; says Chessie. The team was impressed 
        with the number of Bowdoin support while in Minnesota. Not only were a 
        few current Bowdoin students in attendance, but a strong following of 
        Bowdoin Alumni were also present. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bright spots for the team in the bleak Minnesota weather included a trip 
        to the Mall of America (where both Chessie and Kirsten Larsen '04 found 
        &quot;great deals on jackets&quot;) and the repeated stops at Barbara 
        Jean's Diner. Larsen boasts &quot;The french toast was madd good!&quot; 
        So good in fact that the team had to go back for more than one meal at 
        the sweet Mom and Pop restaurant. The final word on the trip came from 
        Jen Pelkey ('04) who said, &quot;You're good, you're good, you're good...you're 
        on someone's lawn.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Upon their triumphant return to campus, the Bears proceeded to defeat 
        Trinity and Wesleyan. The ended their break with a win over the University 
        of Southern Maine and a pair of wins over Connecticut College. Next up 
        for Bowdoin is a match-up this Friday night with Amherst College. In their 
        previous meeting this season, Bowdoin came away with a 4-0 victory. Your 
        attendance on Friday in Dayton Arena will guarantee you an evening filled 
        with high quality, constant action leading to a satisfying outcome. How 
        often do you get that guarantee on any night?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Other key match-ups left in the season include playing Colby at home 
        on Thursday, February 12 immediately followed by a weekend roadtrip to 
        face-off with arch-rival Middlebury and NESCAC contender Williams. The 
        ever-confident Larsen claims, &quot;We are going to kick Colby's ass.&quot; 
        The White Mules are currently ranked 8th nationally and sit tied for 2nd 
        in NESCAC with our very own Polar Bears. <br>
      </p>
      <p>All in all the Women's Ice Hockey season is history in the making. You 
        owe it to them and mostly to yourself to witness the magic. <br>
