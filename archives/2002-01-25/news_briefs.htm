      <p align="left"><font size="4"><i><b><font size="3">Search for anthrax mailer 
        continues, reward beefed up</font></b></i></font><br>
        While several months have passed since the last known mailing of anthrax 
        contaminated envelopes, the F.B.I. continues to pursue the unknown sender 
        in the New Jersey area.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fliers have been distributed around central New Jersey and 
        nearby parts of Pennsylvania. The search focuses upon the Hamilton Township, 
        the location of the post office from where the letters were first processed.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The fliers bear images of those envelopes that were recovered, 
        and offer a reward of $2.5 million for information leading to the arrest 
        of the terrorist in our midst.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To date, the anthrax-contaminated mail accounts for five 
        deaths and several hospitalizations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The reward, which has recently been doubled, comes from 
        a joint $2 million pledge from the United States Postal Service and the 
        F.B.I. As well as a $500,000 offer from the private mailing organization 
        of Advo Inc.</p>
      <p><b><i><font size="3">Bush to ask for increase in military budget</font></i></b><br>
        This past Wednesday, President Bush announced that he plans to ask Congress 
        for a $48 billion increase in military spending. If approved, the military 
        budget would reach a staggering $380 billion, the highest it has been 
        since the last days of the Cold War under the Reagan administration.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This proposed increase comes as little surprise to many, following the 
        increased military activity in the wake of the September 11 attacks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Due to increased security measures on the American homefront, Bush also 
        announced aspirations to hire 30,000 new airport security personal, as 
        well as to recruit 300 new F.B.I. agents. </p>
      <p><b><i>Fired Enron auditor seeks refuge behind Fifth Amendment<br>
        </i></b>David Duncan, who served as an auditor for the Houston-based Enron 
        Corporation, was subpoenaed by The House Energy and Commerce Committee 
        last Wednesday. Duncan was fired for destroying Enron documents that might 
        have protected the investments of thousands of Americans.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Duncan's lawyers, he will seek immunity from questioning, 
        because information he gives might be self-incriminating.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Enron declared bankruptcy on December 2, marking the largest bankruptcy 
        in the history of American commerce. The bankruptcy is gaining notoriety 
        for Enron's contributions to the Bush campaign and for the ethical practices 
        that involved the well-being of stock-holders and investors. </p>
      <p><b><i>'Hockey Dad' sentence expected soon<br>
        </i></b>The Boston court case that has come to be known as the &quot;Hockey 
        Dad&quot; trial is expected to draw to a close in the near future. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On January 11, Thomas Junta was convicted of involuntary manslaughter 
        in the severe beating and killing of Michael Costin following an argument 
        over a youth hockey practice in which their respective sons participated.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When Judge Charles Grabau sentences Junta, he could face anything from 
        probation up to a 20 year prison sentence. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Junta has plead self-defense and has shown a great deal of remorse and 
        sorrow for his actions which grew out of hand at the Reading, MA ice rink 
        in the summer of 2000. </p>
      <p><b><i>Gov. King's laptop initiative may take shape<br>
        </i></b>Maine Republican leaders are attempting to stall Governor King's 
        plan of putting free iBook computers on the desks of seventh and eighth 
        graders throughout the state.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maine has a $37 million contract with Apple that would provide computers 
        to nine test schools throughout the state.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Currently $30 million is allotted for this program, though it is being 
        stalled by Republican leaders for fear that this initiative would dip 
        into funding for Medicaid.</p>
      <p><b><i>Williamstown bar ban sends students back to the dorms<br>
        </i></b>Canterbury's Pub, a popular hangout for Williams College students, 
        was placed on probation by the Williamstown Board of Selectmen early last 
        week. As a result of the decision, Canterbury's may no longer hold its 
        celebrated Thursday night &quot;Club Canterbury&quot;, which allowed underage 
        patrons to enter the pub.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The popularity of this night and the influx of minors that ensued resulted 
        in several accounts of underage drinking, as well as fights between patrons 
        and accusations of illegal gambling.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The increase in fights between patrons enjoying Thursday night &quot;Club 
        Canterbury&quot; came to a head in late November when a brawl broke out 
        just outside the pub, engaging between thirty and forty people. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Canterbury's Pub will remain on probation for the remainder of the year, 
        until their liquor license is up for review next December. <br>
