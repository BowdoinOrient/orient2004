        <font size="2">ANDREW MINESS</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST<br>
        </font><br>
        As a professional tennis fan, I find myself defending the sport to those 
        who claim that it requires less skill and endurance than the typical major 
        sports. Of course tennis does not have the same aesthetic appeal as a 
        bone crushing hit in football, or a reverse dunk in basketball, or even 
        a diving catch in baseball; but one must appreciate the gracefulness, 
        athleticism and concentration required to return a 140 mph serve or to 
        make a diving volley on break point. Coaching is not allowed, nor is an 
        extended timeout for what is termed &quot;a lack of conditioning&quot; 
        (better known as cramping). Thus, to those skeptical of the skill needed 
        to play professional tennis, I merely have to point you to a great such 
        as Pete Sampras. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sampras embodies the ingredients needed to become a legend 
        in professional tennis. His composure, matched with uncanny quickness 
        and toughness has catapulted him to the top of tennis record books. He 
        has won 13 Grand Slam titles in his career, more than any man to ever 
        play the game. However, Sampras has often been criticized for failing 
        to bring a strong personality to the game. He has let his racket do the 
        talking, instead of becoming wrapped up in the commercialized corporate 
        world that has turned many professional tennis players (namely Andre Agassi 
        and Anna Kournikova) into celebrities rather than pure athletes. That 
        is why I have respected Sampras so much over the years; he never made 
        himself bigger than the sport - that is up until the 2002 Australian Open 
        when he sewed American flags over Nike emblems on all his clothing.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Sampras ended his eight-year contract with Nike, citing 
        that, &quot;At the end of the day you have to feel good about the deals 
        that you do, and as regards to Nike, I don't.&quot; That is fine; Sampras 
        does not have to continue his sponsorship with Nike if he does not wish 
        to. But give me a break, please do not sew an American flag over the Nike 
        swoosh on your playing shirts and attire because now it is convenient 
        for you! With the current status of America, the flag has certainly taken 
        on new meaning to many people. Many Americans have decided to attach American 
        flags onto their cars and houses since the attacks of September 11. In 
        doing so, Americans have made a concerted effort to show their patriotism 
        and respect for those men and women risking their lives to protect this 
        country. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I feel like Sampras decided to place the flags on his Nike 
        attire for the wrong reasons. It seems like more than a coincidence that 
        Sampras had the flags sewn on after his contract expired, rather than 
        doing so at season ending tournaments in 2001. In my opinion, it shows 
        a lack of sensitivity on the part of Sampras. It appears that he did what 
        was popular merely because it played in nicely with his contract problems 
        with Nike. The American flag is about patriotism and respect for this 
        nation's history, not a fashionable design sewn onto clothing to cover 
        a company's name. In this case, Sampras allowed skeptics of professional 
        tennis to criticize the sport, and rightfully so. America is at war over 
        competing ideologies and to retaliate after September 11. Therefore, the 
        flag should be a symbol of America's solidarity and pride; not a symbol 
        hiding a Nike swoosh. Thus, the advantage does not go to Sampras... <br>
