      <p align="left">Elsewhere in this week's <i>Orient</i>, Professors DeCoster 
        and Hornsten discuss negative consequences of grade inflation: Diminished 
        ability of employers to differentiate between more and less promising 
        candidates; increased reliance on non-academic measures of success; and 
        reduced incentives for top students to excel. While acknowledging David 
        Vail's findings (also in this issue) that different faculty members have 
        different conceptions of the meaning and purpose of grades, it is nonetheless 
        important to understand why a widespread increase in grades, or &quot;grade 
        creep,&quot; has occurred over the past years.<br>

      <p align="left">As an analogy, consider a crowded football stadium in which 
        an eager fan in the front row stands up to see slightly better. Those 
        seated behind this fan, their view obstructed, also stand. This process 
        propagates to the back of the stadium. The end result: Everyone can see 
        exactly as well as they could before the standing process began, but now 
        everyone is standing and, presumably, less comfortable. While a given 
        person sees a benefit in standing up-regardless of whether others are 
        standing or not-that individual does not face the cost (an obstructed 
        view) imposed on others. It is this &quot;externality,&quot; or ignored 
        cost, that leads to the socially undesirable outcome where all are standing.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Similarly, grade inflation tends to arise from individual 
        incentives. While individual faculty are the ultimate arbiters of grades 
        in the short run, they are guided by the grading conventions of their 
        respective departments. Each of these groups benefits from increasing 
        grades slightly, irrespective of others' grading policies, but does not 
        personally face the full social costs of grade inflation. Grade inflation 
        has a tendency to occur because there are numerous incentives in favor 
        of, and very few against, the progressive inflation of grades at these 
        different levels.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some students put subtle or overt pressure on faculty to 
        increase their grades in order to increase their success in the job market 
        or graduate school admissions, or to assure their parents of their achievement. 
        Students also &quot;vote with their registration cards&quot; to some extent: 
        all else equal, they are attracted to classes that give the highest grades 
        for the least amount of effort. Assuming equal quality of instruction 
        by two different professors or departments, and equal interest in the 
        subject matter, prospective students are attracted to the course or major 
        where good grades are easier to come by. They can thus allocate more of 
        their time to the myriad extracurricular obligations- social, athletic, 
        or other?our students undertake.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Individual faculty members have a strong incentive to inflate 
        grades. It is easier for a professor to acquiesce in any given case than 
        to deal with an anxious, even angry student. David Vail's survey of the 
        faculty suggests that teaching evaluations are seen (by at least some 
        faculty) as positively affected by relaxed grading standards and that 
        the classroom environment is more congenial when stress about grades is 
        reduced. In addition, students appear to be achieving at a high level 
        as grades increase nominally, which reflects positively upon the professor. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At a departmental level, course enrollments and the number 
        of majors are often used as the basis for addition or retention of faculty 
        positions, as well as for allocation of other resources. Competition for 
        students causes departments to relax grading standards; the grading reputation 
        of departments and individual faculty likely spreads quickly and is incorporated 
        into students' selection of courses and majors. Students receiving high 
        grades in a department's introductory classes are also more likely to 
        feel they are competent to pursue a major in that subject.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While both professors and departments see benefits from 
        inflating grades slightly, neither of them directly feel the negative 
        impacts of grade creep. Despite the knowledge that grade inflation erodes 
        the value of the grading signal in general, and may have negative social 
        consequences in the future, there is no direct feedback mechanism that 
        causes an individual professor or department to incorporate these ill 
        effects into their grading policies. In economic terms, though the social 
        costs of grade inflation may outweigh any benefit received by grade-givers, 
        the private costs are small and do not eclipse the private benefits.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The outcome of these incentives is a grading d&eacute;tente, 
        as described by Professors DeCoster and Hornsten, with grades increasingly 
        compressed at the top end of the grading scale and decreasingly useful 
        as a means of distinguishing between students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Assuming grade creep is worth stopping, how can it be stopped? 
        It is not necessary to impose a particular interpretation of grades on 
        faculty members, provided their interpretation remains consistent. Rather, 
        an effective policy would reduce the incentives individuals and departments 
        have to increase grades, or?to use David Vail's term?deflate their grading 
        standards over time. </p>
      <p align="left">One possible step is to follow Professors DeCoster and Hornsten's 
        suggestion that grades be reported in a relative context. With this additional 
        information, Cs would lose their &quot;punitive connotation.&quot; Individual 
        faculty members would realize that by inflating one student's grade they 
        are disadvantaging the others and possibly, in the long run, themselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Modifying grading policy is complex and likely contentious. 
        In the stadium, a simple shout of &quot;Down in front!&quot; might suffice.</p>
