      <p>The Golden Globes are nothing more than a wanna-be serious awards show-and 
        everyone knows it. When Hollywood starlets win an Oscar, the shiny talisman 
        sits on the mantle over the fireplace in a display case protected by its 
        own laser security system. A solitary Golden Globe, on the other hand, 
        gathers dust on a wooden shelf low enough for the dog to reach. Putting 
        a G. G. on the mantle means that was as far as they got-they didn't get 
        an Oscar-they weren't good enough for the real thing. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, the G. G. s provide an actor or movie-maker with nothing more than 
        delusions of grandeur-at least until March, when the almighty Little Golden 
        Guy judges his or her true worth. The winners cry and stutter and thank 
        the Academy. The losers shrug and say, &quot;It was an honor just to be 
        nominated,&quot; which is crap. Their G. G. sans Oscar becomes a torturing 
        reminder of what could've been. So give it to the dog-and better luck 
        next year. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This past Sunday some lucky people received that symbol of hope-Hollywood's 
        most precious scratch ticket-the Golden Globe. For what it's worth, I 
        present some of the highlights from the show.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The obvious conversation piece is that brilliant Aussie Russell Crowe. 
        He was sporting something awfully close to a mullet, but we'll ignore 
        that for his sake. His role as the schizophrenic John Nash in <i>A Beautiful 
        Mind</i> was one of the greatest male performances I've ever seen. Playing 
        the crazy guy is the surest way to an Oscar, just ask Jack Nicholson. 
        Crowe has little to worry about come March.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's thanks to his and Jennifer Connelly's G. G.-honored performance 
        that the film ended up with the coveted Best Picture-Drama award. Ron 
        Howard as a director doesn't get anywhere unless he's got some stunning 
        actors to make his overdramatic storylines realistic. Thankfully, he didn't 
        get the directing nod-he doesn't deserve it. That one went to Robert Altman 
        for his exceptional work in the smart social satire <i>Gosford Park</i>-which 
        is something like Clue with a graduate degree from Oxford, a monocle, 
        and a generous helping of British accents. <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Gosford Park</i> was nominated for a category unique to the Golden 
        Globes: Best Picture: Musical or Comedy. It faced some tough competition, 
        particularly from <i>Moulin Rouge</i>, another electrified Baz Luhrmann 
        freak show, and <i>Shrek</i>, the Disney-bashing animated blockbuster 
        with a good heart and plenty of laughs. The winner ended up being one 
        of the most unappreciated good movies of the year: <i>Moulin Rouge</i>. 
        Some hated it because it was fast, others because it had Nicole Kidman, 
        and others would rather die than sit through a musical. Well, not only 
        did it get Best Musical/Comedy, but Kidman, whose dress I want to steal, 
        also won Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical. So, to anyone who told me it 
        wasn't worth anything, I say a whiny &quot;I told you so.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <table width="250" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="left">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/ae01_tenenbaums.jpg" width="250" height="200"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">The Tenenbaum family gathers for a tension-filled 
            discussion with its patriarch. (<a href="http://www.hollywood.com">hollywood.com</a>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>I must confess that I was upset that <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>, the 
        year's smoothest intellectual comedy, didn't get the G. G.-but at least 
        Gene Hackman was recognized. He was so perfect as Royal Tenenbaum, the 
        ignorant father of a family of geniuses who also happens to be the only 
        character who laughs. <br>
        Every year, there are always one or two new and obscure winning actors; 
        you can tell by the way the Hollywood audience applauds this victory that 
        they don't welcome the new competition. This year that &quot;honor&quot; 
        went to Jim Broadbent for his performance in <i>Iris</i>. The fact that 
        I had never seen him before made me more bitter towards him than the other 
        nominees were. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Thankfully, I was armed with knowledge and appreciation for Sissy Spacek's 
        award-winning performance in <i>In the Bedroom</i> (which I saw Sunday 
        afternoon at The Eveningstar-close call). A warning: don't think that 
        <i>In the Bedroom</i> is some sort of sexual thriller. The title actually 
        refers to lobster fishing, of all things. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Now that the Golden Globes ordeal is over, the countdown begins to the 
        biggest night in Hollywood-the real thing-the Academy Awards. </p>
