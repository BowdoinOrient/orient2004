      <p align="left">The New England Small College Athletic Association presidents 
        met on December 13 in Boston to discuss admissions procedures for rated 
        athletes. Bowdoin College President Barry Mills said that a few important 
        developments emerged from that meeting.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We had a follow-up discussion about the issues related 
        to admissions,&quot; he said. &quot;At that meeting, Williams, Amherst, 
        and Wesleyan announced a reduction in the number of rated athletes that 
        is consistent...with what Bowdoin is doing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;It was gratifying to see that these other three schools 
        are going to take similar kinds of action,&quot; Mills said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Ten days prior to the meeting, Bowdoin Dean of Admissions 
        Jim Miller announced that the College would admit 20 percent fewer rated 
        athletes next year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The only other NESCAC school aside from the aforementioned 
        institutions to make such a statement at the December 13 meeting was Middlebury. 
        &quot;Middlebury announced that they were going to take similar actions, 
        but they were less specific in their actual goals,&quot; Mills said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The numbers aren't as important as the principle that 
        they're going to do this,&quot; Mills said. &quot;There was general agreement 
        around the table that the level of reduction for rated athletes would 
        be about the same as it was here at Bowdoin.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">No other specific commitments have been publicized from 
        the six other schools in the league.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Mills, the presidents agreed to continue meeting 
        and talking about admissions systems and the definition of rated athletes. 
        A rated athlete is one marked as 'desirable' for admission by a coach. 
        &quot;We want to understand the vocabulary when we talk together,&quot; 
        Mills said. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Giving an example of such difficulties in school-to-school 
        comparison, Mills cited Williams and Amherst: schools that do not count 
        legacies in their number of rated athletes. &quot;That's one of the reasons 
        we want to get the admissions people together and make sure we're all 
        talking in the same way,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mills indicated that the process would continue through 
        this year and into the future. &quot;We need to continue to talk about 
        appropriate candidates for admissions,&quot; he said. The presidents need 
        to agree that the basic principle upon which the NESCAC was formed-that 
        students who are at any of these schools and participate in athletics 
        should be representative of the student body as a whole-continues to be 
        a principle that we believe appropriate for the NESCAC.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The next presidents meeting will take place sometime in 
        the spring. Meanwhile, the College administration plans to keep the discussion 
        ball rolling.<br>
        &quot;I think we're going to continue in our goal to reach this NESCAC 
        standard,&quot; Mills said. &quot;We have to make sure that we understand 
        and support the importance of athletics on this campus. I'll be working 
        with Jeff Ward and Jim Miller, and we're going to be focusing on ways 
        to create better communication between coaches and faulty.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We'll be working on ways to enhance both the athletic 
        and academic experience for people who participate in athletics on this 
        campus,&quot; he continued. &quot;I think it's very important for us to 
        recognize the value that both the coaches and the faculty have here as 
        teachers. We're all working toward the same goals and creating greater 
        levels of communication to try to reach those goals.&quot;<br>
