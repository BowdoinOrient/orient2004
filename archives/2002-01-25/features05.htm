      <p align="left">March 1862. The Union Army of the Potomac under the command 
        of General George McClellan set off for the York-James Peninsula to advance 
        against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. In this army was 
        young Major Thomas W. Hyde of the Bowdoin class of 1861. His regiment 
        was the Seventh Maine, a part of the Sixth Army Corps. An enthusiastic 
        supporter of the War, Hyde had volunteered early on but had seen no action.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was on the Peninsula that Hyde first came into contact 
        with rebel troops. At Yorktown, his men skirmished with the enemy defenders. 
        &quot;I saw my first man killed that day,&quot; Hyde later wrote about 
        his adventures in front of Yorktown, &quot;a shell cut him in two. I think 
        he was the first man killed in the Army of the Potomac-Joe Pepper, of 
        Bath. He used to work for us at home, and when I went out to help bury 
        him that night and took his wife's picture from his bloody pocket, for 
        a moment I would have given all I had in the world to get out of the army; 
        the horror of it was so cruel.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">George McClellan set down to put Yorktown under siege. At 
        the time, the city was defended by a mere ten thousand men, but the Union 
        commander did not know that. McClellan kept guessing the true Confederate 
        strength till the rebels pulled out of Yorktown on their own. The armies 
        met again at the town of Williamsburg. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Seventh Maine along with other elements of a force commanded 
        by General Winfield Hancock, moved towards the left of the rebel line 
        and finding it unoccupied, advanced towards the exposed Confederate flank. 
        The Confederates slowly became aware of their exposed flank and sent troops 
        to fight off the threat. The Seventh Maine was ordered to lie flat on 
        the ground, and thus it was concealed as the rebels collided with elements 
        of two other Union regiments. As the Union troops fell back and the rebels 
        came forward across the Seventh's front, General Hancock signaled for 
        the Maine men to charge. Hyde followed his regiment as it went forward. 
        He later wrote that, &quot;the foe&#133;seemed to dissolve all at once 
        into a quivering and disintegrating mass and to scatter in all directions. 
        Upon this we halted and opened fire, and the view of it through the smoke 
        was pitiful. They were falling everywhere; white handkerchiefs were held 
        up in token of surrender.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I went over the field,&quot; Hyde recalled, &quot;and 
        tried to harden myself to the sights of horror and agony. One gets accustomed 
        to such things, just as doctors get accustomed to the dissecting table&#133;&quot; 
        That night as the men bedded down, &quot;beside their dim watch-fires 
        murmurs of hushed conversation arose, and the phosphorescent flow on the 
        faces of the dead in the fields beyond became more weird as the night 
        sped on.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As the rebels retreated to Richmond the Union army followed. 
        McClellan was still overly cautious even though he had scored a victory 
        at the Battle of Fair Oaks. When the rebel army's commander was wounded, 
        Virginian Robert E. Lee was put in his place.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Union army would not stay long in front of Richmond 
        for Lee counter-punched McClellan's superior forces until the Union general 
        went trembling back down the Peninsula to his new base on the James River. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Union advance had halted. The initiative was now all 
        Lee's, for McClellan was stuck in the mud, crying for more troops.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Earlier that year, smaller defeats in other theaters of 
        the War had caused concern for the future of the nation. William Pitt 
        Fessenden, himself a Bowdoin graduate (18 years before Hyde was even born) 
        was by now a senior Republican senator who was in control of the powerful 
        Senate Finance Committee. To him fell the task of funding the entire war, 
        and, thus, he had reason to be unhappy with the military's lack of progress. 
        Fessenden was thus more than happy to lend his support to the founding 
        of the Committee on the Conduct of the War.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With three of his sons (all Bowdoin graduates, the youngest 
        being Sam Fessenden, who was a classmate of Thomas Hyde's) in the armed 
        forces, Fessenden also felt a need to see to it that the War was being 
        run by someone who knew what he was doing. He interviewed Lincoln's second 
        Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, before he approved of him as a replacement 
        for the incompetent Simon Cameron.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was also during this time that the purpose of the War 
        itself came under discussion in Washington. Fessenden was beginning to 
        have ideological disagreements with some of the more radical members of 
        the Republican Party who believed the War should only be about the abolition 
        of slavery. For Fessenden, it was still about preserving the Union and 
        staying strictly within the bounds of the Constitution.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On the Senate floor, Fessenden supported the Internal Revenue 
        Bill, which increased taxes on a number of items. The funding of the War 
        was his top priority as he stated early in 1862. &quot;My great anxiety 
        now is about money&#133;A few months will, I fear, see the country bankrupt&#133;&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Fessenden worked hard as Chairman of the Senate Finance 
        Committee and soon after Congress closed its doors for recess, the senator 
        sat back to watch the military situation unfold. &quot;I have no confidence 
        in McClellan,&quot; he confided and later, after the failure of the Peninsula 
        Campaign was evident, &quot;Richmond could have been taken in three weeks 
        from the time he landed. His caution, however, amounts to timidity and 
        has well nigh ruined one of the noblest armies in the world.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But there was another fight coming, and this time it would 
        involve another Union army in the lead role. Its adversary was of course 
        Robert E. Lee and, as the nation braced for the new surge of Confederate 
        arms and confidence, William Pitt Fessenden must have shivered for perhaps 
        he was aware that something catastrophic was in the air. <br>
