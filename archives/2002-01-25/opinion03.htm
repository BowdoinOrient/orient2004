      <p align="left"><font size="5">Debate, discuss national holidays like Veterans, 
        Labor Day</font><br>
        <font size="2">TODD BUELL<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Readers of this newspaper are probably not surprised that I was utterly 
        disappointed in Robert Johnson's speech on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
        His overt, unveiled, and partisan disdain for the Bush administration 
        was inappropriately divisive for a holiday that is meant to unite. Certainly 
        Prof. Johnson is as entitled to his opinions as I am, but the speech made 
        me wonder why it is that the College does not do more to encourage debate 
        and discussion surrounding this and all other national holidays. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a holiday that we should recognize with 
        a gathering or celebration, but so are numerous other holidays that we 
        choose to ignore. Labor Day, Veterans Day, and Presidents Day present 
        themselves with people, movements, or monumental achievements that should 
        be fairly celebrated and critically analyzed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I asked a member of Bowdoin's special events staff why we only recognize 
        the King holiday. He answered that he didn't know the precise reason, 
        except that over 20 years ago, students and other members of the community 
        decided that it was a worthwhile holiday to celebrate. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As a college, we should treat national holidays with both a celebratory 
        and critical eye. Despite the universal agreement that civil rights for 
        African Americans are good, debate on Dr. King's legacy should contribute 
        to all celebrations. As a school, we should engage in healthy discourse 
        over what Dr. King would think about slave reparations or affirmative 
        action. This celebrating of achievements and confronting of contemporary 
        questions brings meaning to all holidays. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As we commence a new academic year, we should engage ourselves in a serious 
        discussion as to the meaning of Labor Day. Critically examining issues 
        that focus on the workplace should be of paramount importance to us because 
        that is our post-&quot;Bowdoin bubble&quot; destination. We should pursue 
        questions about the role of unions in the &quot;New Economy,&quot; or 
        think about the type of environment in which we wish to be employed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As autumn leaves drift off the trees and daylight dwindles, Veterans 
        Day comes upon us. Considering the number of Bowdoin men who have served 
        in wars, including one of our most storied alumni, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, 
        it is almost unconscionable that we do nothing to honor these brave individuals. 
        Much of the video during the Martin Luther King Jr. celebration focused 
        on the bravery of King and other civil rights leaders who knew they were 
        putting their lives and families in peril by supporting justice. The same 
        sacrifice is made daily by all of our military men and women. We are remiss 
        and ungracious as citizens if we do not recognize those who have faced 
        unimaginable dangers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the midst of winter lies the month of February, which is the birth 
        month of three of our great Presidents: Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln. 
        Fifty years ago there would have been no debate regarding the need to 
        celebrate the birthdays of these magnanimous figures. Today, possession 
        of slaves obscures Washington and Jefferson's greatness. The fact that 
        Washington freed his slaves upon his death does little to preserve his 
        image among some liberal politicians and commentators. Such myopic scribes 
        refuse to acknowledge the courageous dispositions of these great men. 
        Washington displayed his prowess on the battlefield leading an undermanned 
        and poorly equipped army to victory over imperial forces. Jefferson helped 
        mold the Declaration of Independence and immortalized the American ideal 
        that &quot;we are all created equal.&quot; Although some view the phrase 
        as a lie because he held slaves, the fact is that Jefferson and many other 
        founders knew slavery was wrong but believed that it would be better to 
        erect a union based on the principles of freedom than destroy the dream 
        of the United States over one issue. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Their prescience manifested itself during the Civil War when Abraham 
        Lincoln preserved the Union against the South's insurgence. Lincoln loathed 
        the practice of slavery. He said so outright in his 1854 &quot;Peoria&quot; 
        speech against the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, where he calls slavery 
        a &quot;monstrous injustice.&quot; Our failure as a school to recognize 
        his birthday and accomplishments, especially considering our school's 
        connection to Abolition vis-&agrave;-vis Harriet Beecher Stowe, is troubling.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Clearly, some of my statements regarding these historical figures and 
        even the premise that we should recognize holidays in an intellectually 
        balanced manner are controversial. However the grappling and debating 
        of different topics is the epitome of a liberal arts education, and what 
        better time is there to pursue this scholarly ideal than in the context 
        of world-renowned figures and causes immortalized in national holidays.</p>
