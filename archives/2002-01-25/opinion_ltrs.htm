      <p align="left"><font size="5">The debate continues</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I am writing in response to the recent article detailing a number of 
        professors' thoughts on the place of athletes (and for that matter, athletics 
        as a whole) at Bowdoin. Let me first make clear that I believe that academics 
        are the centerpiece of life at Bowdoin and should undoubtedly remain as 
        such. We all, as students before anything else, come to Bowdoin for an 
        education, and it would be a mistake to suggest that any other pursuits 
        have priority over academic responsibilities. However, I think there are 
        problems with some of the examples given in the NESCAC study, such as 
        the use of SAT scores. Bowdoin doesn't even require SAT's for admission, 
        so why should it use them to judge a student who's already enrolled? <br>
      </p>
      <p>My argument, however, does not revolve around the merits or shortcomings 
        of the data in the study. My musings instead address the sentiments of 
        various professors towards student athletes (and athletics as a whole), 
        and the recent actions taken by the administration and admissions office. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Let's face it, college is not ENTIRELY about academics. If we all marched 
        in straight lines from our dorms to the dining hall, to classes, and then 
        to the library, our four years would be entirely useless. We all might 
        have our periodic tables permanently etched onto the interior of our skulls, 
        or perhaps the ability to write half-accurate critiques of Finnegan's 
        Wake (most likely not), but would we have really learned anything? Would 
        we be able to start and hold a meaningful conversation about anything 
        other than the merits of democracy?Could we bring real-life experiences 
        to discussions of academic ideals and as a result evaluate the validity 
        of various theories? Would we learn about teamwork and unified progress 
        towards an established goal? <br>
      </p>
      <p>The answer is clearly no. What students do outside of the classroom is 
        one of the most important aspects of college. The lessons learned in social, 
        club, and yes, athletic activities, are vital to the development of students. 
        To be called a well-rounded college student is a high compliment, and 
        is something we all should strive for. Conversely, to suggest that a student 
        is &quot;too well-rounded to get a grip on&quot; implies that having serious 
        aspirations outside the academic sphere is a mistake.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In becoming professors, instructors at Bowdoin have clearly chosen academics 
        as their vocation. As such, it is understandable that they value intellectual 
        pursuits above all else. As students, I would venture that we all respect 
        that decision, just as we hope that professors would respect our decision 
        to include athletics as a significant part of our lives. I would also 
        expand this statement to include the idea of athletic success, not simply 
        participation. It would be a waste of money (and other resources) to maintain 
        intercollegiate athletics simply for exercise or diversion. Student athletes 
        at Bowdoin should be encouraged not only to play sports, but also to play 
        to win-just as professors encourage students in the classroom to excel 
        beyond mediocrity and a passing grade to a higher level of academic pursuit. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The measures adopted by the administration and admissions office (which 
        limit the number of &quot;rated&quot; athletes at Bowdoin) unduly cripple 
        Bowdoin's athletic programs and at the same time do not guarantee any 
        substantial academic improvements. The measures limit the student athlete's 
        ability to excel and succeed, not only in terms of raising a NESCAC trophy 
        or earning an NCAA tournament berth, but also regarding personal and team 
        goals. Competing on a team under such restrictions is akin to trying to 
        write a complete plot synopsis of a novel that's had the last few chapters 
        torn out. You can apply yourself as hard and long as you want and get 
        some of it right, but it will never be complete and you'll never gain 
        any real satisfaction. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Most Bowdoin athletes play because they love their sports, but there's 
        a limit to that love. Take away their ability to compete for meaningful 
        goals, and they'll eventually recognize that they can't win. Maybe it'll 
        be next year, or maybe in three, but it will happen. So student athletes 
        will dial it down a notch, lower their athletic aspirations, and maybe 
        spend a little more time in the library, or maybe not. But what real lesson 
        will they learn: one of success or failure? Will those student athletes 
        be better prepared for life after college? And will Bowdoin be a better 
        place for limiting their hopes and goals because they were not just students, 
        but student athletes? There's no easy answer, but I believe that these 
        questions need to be considered in addressing any perceived academic discrepancies 
        between student athletes and others.</p>

      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>I recently received a letter signed by several hundred students, faculty, 
        and members of the Bowdoin College community expressing a deep and profound 
        concern about climate change.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Climate change is a serious and growing problem. Global temperatures 
        have increased by approximately one degree over the last 100 years. According 
        to the scientific community, it is likely that much of this warming is 
        due to human activities that have increased atmospheric greenhouse gas 
        concentrations. This warming is expected to accelerate: the best predictions 
        forecast an increase in global temperatures of anywhere from 2.5 to 10 
        degrees by the end of the next century.<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to a report recently prepared by the National Academy of Sciences, 
        such warming could well have serious adverse societal and ecological impacts, 
        including droughts, floods, sea level rise, and far reaching changes to 
        ecosystems.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Addressing this problem involves developing a national energy policy 
        that increases our energy efficiency and develops our renewable energy 
        resources. With the Senate's nearly even division of Democrats and Republicans, 
        any progress on this front will be forged at the center. I have joined 
        Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York, in proposing a balanced, 
        bi-partisan energy plan that increases efficiency, promotes alternative 
        energy sources, and protects the environment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Our best strategy for meeting energy needs and reducing greenhouse gas 
        emissions, particularly in the short term, is to increase conservation. 
        If we had to meet all needs by increasing supply alone, we'd have to build 
        one power plant a week every week for the next 20 years. While additional 
        power plants are necessary, we won't need to build nearly so many if we 
        adopt good conservation measures.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If every American household were to replace just four 100-watt incandescent 
        light bulbs with compact flourescent bulbs, we'd eliminate the need to 
        build 30 new power plants. By adopting new efficiency standards for refrigerators 
        and air conditioners, we can eliminate the need to build 170 power plants. 
        By passing the Energy Efficiency Buildings Act, we can eliminate the need 
        for even more.<br>
      </p>
      <p>U.S. businesses, municipalities, and educational institutions are finding 
        that investments in energy efficiency cut power bills and provide rapid 
        payback while reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Even upgrading 
        the light bulbs in public buildings can save thousands of dollars annually. 
        That's a lot of money to save just by changing light bulbs!<br>
      </p>
      <p>We also need to further develop our renewable energy resources. As co-chair 
        of the Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, I have been 
        a leader in promoting renewable energy technologies. I led a successful 
        effort to pass an amendment to the FY 2002 Budget Resolution that would 
        increase funding for renewable energy and other measures to reduce greenhouse 
        gas emissions. The amendment provides $4.5 billion over the next ten years 
        to bolster essential federal investments in renewable energy technologies, 
        climate change research, and other essential programs. I was the first 
        Republican to cosponsor this amendment. In passing it, we sent a strong 
        message that theUnited States Senate takes the issue of climate change 
        very seriously.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Energy conservation and renewable energy technologies will reduce the 
        pressure to drill in wilderness areas while increasing our nation's energy 
        independence. I am working for tax incentives that encourage the production 
        and purchase of cars powered by fuels other than gasoline, so-called alternative-fueled 
        vehicles. Estimates show that those incentives could conserve many times 
        the amount of energy we would obtain by drilling in Alaska's Arctic National 
        Wildlife Refuge.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When combined with increased fuel economy standards for automobiles, 
        which I also support, we could significantly reduce our reliance on foreign 
        oil without drilling a single drop from the Arctic Refuge.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have a lot of work to do in order to create a comprehensive energy 
        plan for America. I hope to work with the President and Congressional 
        leaders on both sides of the aisle to draft a plan that will garner broad 
        bipartisan support and create a secure energy future for America. By doing 
        so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save millions of barrels of 
        oil and billions of dollars, reduce the need to erect new power plants, 
        help our economy, and preserve our natural environment.</p>

      <p align="left"><font size="3">To the Editors:</font></p>
      <p>I read Ludwig Rang's article on &quot;Returning to the U.S., a nation 
        in shock&quot; [December 7, 2001]. In reference to the Kennedy assassination, 
        he mentioned the Dallas schoolchildren who clapped when they heard the 
        news. I have been refuting that old story for years. <br>
      </p>
      <p>I was living in Dallas and was out shopping that morning. There were 
        many school-age children dressed in Sunday clothing around, and I asked 
        a salesclerk why this was. She replied that the children were going to 
        see the parade when Kennedy drove through downtown. I was very impressed 
        that everyone was dressed up for the event.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Later, when my husband called to tell me to turn on the TV, I sat and 
        cried with everyone else. Many of us living in Dallas were not Kennedy 
        supporters, but we greatly mourned the death in our city of our young 
        president. The children who clapped were not told the whole story and 
        were clapping because school was dismissed early.<br>
