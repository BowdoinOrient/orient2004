      <p align="left"><font size="5">Reflections on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
        Day</font><br>
        <font size="2">EIDER GORDILLO<br>
        </font><br>
      </p>
      <p>Monday's ceremony of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day gathered various 
        members of the Bowdoin community at Pickard Theater for songs, a video 
        of King's life, a tune played by Bowdoin's own Professor Robby Greenlee, 
        and a talk by Bowdoin alum and trustee Dr. Robert Johnson-the first president 
        of the African-American Society at Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The tunes resounded in the pretty-looking auditorium, and it was special 
        that people actually showed up-something that does not surprise me. I 
        want to reiterate the importance of such a gathering. To be frank, I did 
        not learn much, or feel something particularly new. Still, the symbolism 
        and potential effect of such a gathering, which ended in the traditionally 
        African-American struggle chant &quot;We Shall Overcome,&quot; may either 
        disappoint or enrich this community in the coming years. <br>
      </p>
      <p>To be clear, I believe it speaks to the new face of Bowdoin, its current 
        struggles to &quot;diversify,&quot; and the paths we shall continue. In 
        the past years, students have been in awe at the slightly more brown and 
        yellow faces suddenly appearing as each class arrives (like, &quot;Where 
        did you pop from?&quot; or, &quot;Am I still in the same Nalgene-carrying, 
        varsity-tripping, Newsweek-climbing, L.L.Bean funding-school?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The international community may resound: &quot;Stop making such a big 
        deal! Why don't you just get over the race thing and be a 'healthy' community?!&quot; 
        This happened last semester with interesting email battles. To this I 
        say that the realities of racial inequality, gender inequality, and all 
        the other terrors of inequality are yet to be addressed in Bowdoin College. 
        We cannot go to a country and expect that the current discourse does not 
        apply to us in some fashion or another, or that it is simply &quot;political.&quot; 
        If I go to Ireland, especially Northern Ireland, I cannot expect to enter 
        and avoid being surrounded by the tumult and frenzy between Catholics 
        and Protestants. Consequently, I could not tell them to &quot;stop making 
        such a big deal out of it,&quot; and that, &quot;you're both seeking Jesus, 
        anyway!&quot; No. The problem is larger, and it blesses or curses those 
        of us that are here as if it were a nylon umbrella--whether we choose 
        to acknowledge it or not, now or later.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I contend that there is still more room to explore the steps that Bowdoin 
        has taken towards being a college that is inclusive and representative 
        of people who make up this country, including immigrants. And these steps 
        I deeply applaud, for it is an echo of the College's decision in the early 
        '70s to welcome women. During that time, black students were also recruited 
        from New York City, among other places.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And all of this for what? To fulfill the Common Good ideal in terms of 
        inclusion? To bless the network that was already here and to better prepare 
        them for the &quot;real&quot; world? I don't quite know. I do think that 
        it is not to &quot;prepify&quot; minorities of sorts. Rather, the extensive 
        and difficult effort seems to create an environment that is intellectually 
        stimulating from various standpoints. Perhaps things felt incomplete or 
        boring. <br>
      </p>
      <p>My contention to the discourse of cultural diversity is basic: To continue 
        the success of a culturally diverse intellectual body, we must continue 
        conversation about it. Not just, &quot;how has it been for you?&quot; 
        or &quot;tell me more about yourself so that I can tell my friends back 
        home that I met you!&quot; Instead, let's, you and I, meet halfway. Yes, 
        my friends, I hate to sound cheesy or unoriginal, but I can't help to 
        motivate such simple things as &quot;keep talking.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>For this, of course, it requires that people move out of their racial 
        comfort zones. I say &quot;comfort&quot; carefully. Many minorities (or 
        as the school addresses them, &quot;people of color&quot;) understandably 
        find comfort with people of similar racial/ethnic identities. There comes 
        a time, though, where the lack of interaction will lead to a lack of understanding, 
        cultural or otherwise. A lack of understanding will lead to fear and conflict. 
        Fear and conflict, whether within a particular group or outside of it, 
        will lead to escalated racism and assumption, which are the very things 
        the College is trying to avoid (by College I mean not just administration). 
        Indeed it is a harmful cycle that may face Bowdoin if discourse does not 
        continue/expand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What I speak of, I think, is very real. Bowdoin, with its Maine qualities 
        of isolation, may find some of these &quot;issues&quot; to be irrelevant, 
        as mentioned earlier. The reality is that issues of social equality continue 
        to be at the forefront of American discourse, be it of nationality, policy, 
        justice (take the Supreme Court's appointment of Justice Thomas), or otherwise. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, I hold that the &quot;issues&quot; that are dealt with on 
        MLK Jr. Day, a day that a good chunk of the nation has off, are everyday 
        concerns for minorities, and for some of the majority. The concern is 
        clear: civil equality, as granted by the Declaration of Independence. 
        Let's have our women make the whole dollar that men make (rather than 
        roughly half); let's establish college admissions criteria that include 
        rather than exclude, while maintaining the &quot;quality.&quot; Etc., 
        etc.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Social equality is a concern for many, not because people really want 
        to be concerned with apparent fallacies of identity, or because there's 
        nothing else to do with their silly selves, but because the way one looks 
        racially and one's economic background are often intricately connected 
        to one's everyday interactions (Words like &quot;dawg,&quot; for example, 
        are often strange to Bowdoin). It has to do with where one was born. And 
        they aren't just about race, as some may pretend. They are almost entirely 
        not about that. Race, as we know, complicates sexuality, gender identity, 
        ethnic constructions of identity, and even good ol' patriotism, which 
        is losing its charge as Arizona drinks and Domino's remove their &quot;God 
        Bless America&quot; stickers. If Bowdoin is to continue to expand with 
        this sort of glory, of diversifying, as it were, which I believe will 
        go beyond visual landscapes and numbers, social class-and the conversation 
        of it-becomes central. </p>
