      </p>
      <p>The topic of Bowdoin students' well-roundedness, brought up at last month's 
        faculty meeting, deserves a brief discussion. The professors who are skeptical 
        of the overwhelmingly optimistic view of well-roundedness are probably 
        right: Bowdoin students tend to be so well-rounded that they often spread 
        themselves too thinly. Sometimes students are so busy that they seem like 
        they're back in high school, living for the sake of their college applications-now 
        it's their resum&eacute;s and their graduate school applications. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin students would probably do themselves some good if they would 
        ease up on their multitude of activities and focus on just a few activities 
        that they can devote fuller and more meaningful attention to. Now, at 
        the beginning of a new semester, is a good time to question why we do 
        things here, and maybe to consolidate our schedules a bit.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The professors who favor less well-roundedness, however, are very wrong 
        in thinking that we should give up student activities in order to devote 
        more time to classes. Classes can be worthwhile and offer substantial 
        intellectual development, but classes are no more important to our education 
        and personal development than the activities outside of class. In fact, 
        many students will say that their extracurricular activities are the most 
        meaningful and most educational aspects of their college careers.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Forcing students to become superstar academics would only make Bowdoin 
        more of a preparatory school for graduate school than it already is. We 
        do learn a practical trade at Bowdoin: we learn how to be professional 
        students. (And that's not to say we learn to be lifelong learners. That's 
        a virtue you either choose to have or don't; no one teaches you that-not 
        Bowdoin, nor any other school.) Our extracurricular activities offer a 
        way to get real, practical experience in fields unknown in the Bowdoin 
        classroom. For example, since the College refuses to offer classes in 
        journalism, the only way for a student to get experience in the field 
        while here is to join one of the student-run publications.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It's a good idea for both students and faculty to reconsider well-roundedness. 
        Faculty need to understand that classes do not have to be our top priority, 
        and students need to start making some choices.<br>

      <p><font size="5"><a name="ed02"></a>Six 10-page papers? <i>Drop.</i></font></p>
      <p>Today ends the first of our two &quot;shopping&quot; weeks for classes. 
        Most people are content with their four chosen classes by now, but the 
        rest of us have another week to bail out and add on. And for seniors with 
        additional credits, we've also got another week to discover the glory 
        of just dropping a class and taking a reduced course load of three classes. 
        That our two-week add/drop period is far shorter than most other schools' 
        is essentially beside the point; that just makes it all the more important 
        for us to choose our classes wisely now. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Choosing is not always easy, though, especially when a class's syllabus 
        is so scary that we are forced to drop the class. Some classes that may 
        in practice be wholly worthwhile very often seem on paper to be nothing 
        more than a chore; other times a bad class is rightly flagged by a foreboding 
        syllabus. In fact, some professors intentionally try to scare us off in 
        the first day of class by imposing unreasonable regulations and requirements. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>When we look at a class's syllabus, instead of getting a wholesome view 
        of the class, we see it as a list of things that constitute a grade. We 
        get a complicated description of a compartmentalized class, broken down 
        neatly into formalized, required, and nearly always graded parts. In addition 
        to the standard fare of class sessions, labs, essays, quizzes, and exams, 
        there are class participation requirements, class presentations, class 
        discussions led by students, various mock things, group projects, study 
        groups, discussion sessions, required evening lectures, and so on. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Some classes have so many components to them that the various parts substitute 
        for education rather than promote it; sometimes the more innovative, public, 
        and fragmented the course becomes, the farther we get from what's fundamental. 
        We have unaffectionately called the phenomenon, since elementary school, 
        busywork. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course this is not true in all classes-there are many classes that 
        are taught extremely well and efficiently, with respect for the individual 
        student's private, idiosyncratic learning style, as well as his or her 
        time. In some courses, though, we might be getting an education that is 
        not necessarily greater than the sum of its parts.<br>
