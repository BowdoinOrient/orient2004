      <p align="left">To paraphrase Mark Twain, grading, like sausage making, 
        should not be watched too closely. It's an inherently subjective and imprecise 
        weighing of many aspects of student performance. It's highly quantified 
        in some fields, inescapably qualitative in others. And it serves multiple 
        purposes, with no consensus about their relative importance. <br>

      <p align="left">Other articles in this week's <i>Orient</i> highlight Bowdoin's 
        grade inflation. This one documents a widespread deflation of standards: 
        As and Bs received for work that falls below the standards spelled out 
        in the College Catalogue. In 1998, following an earlier grading debate, 
        the faculty set high standards for A and B work:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;A, the student has mastered the material of the course 
        and has demonstrated exceptional critical skills and originality;<br>
        &quot;B, the student has demonstrated a thorough and above average understanding 
        of the material of the course.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Some of us supported this wording in the hope that it would 
        counter grade inflation. It hasn't worked out that way. In 1997-98, 85 
        percent of all grades were As and Bs; last year the fraction was 87 percent. 
        At Bowdoin as in Lake Wobegon, nearly everyone is above average - and 
        getting better.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To get a handle on the apparent gap between grading rhetoric 
        and practice, several Economics Department members surveyed faculty late 
        last fall. 82 colleagues responded, just under half of the fall teaching 
        staff. This article interprets their responses, without addressing basic 
        survey research issues such as sample biases and statistical significance.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Based on 81 faculty members' practices, deflated standards-i.e. 
        inflated grades-are nearly universal. 85 percent of respondents acknowledge 
        that they have given As to students who did not fully meet the Catalogue 
        description of A work; 80 percent say the same about Bs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The responses indicate that deflated standards are not a 
        rarity. For 40 percent of responding faculty, at least one in ten A students 
        fall short of the Catalogue standard; for 20 percent of teachers, this 
        holds for at least one-quarter of As. In the case of Bs, for 48 percent 
        of respondents, at least one in ten B students falls short. And, for 31 
        percent of faculty, this holds for one-quarter or more of all Bs. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few noteworthy patterns stand out in the responses. Although 
        the accompanying tables show that arts and humanities faculty award the 
        largest proportion of As and Bs, comparatively few of them (80 percent) 
        say they have given As for below-standard performance; and, just 15 percent 
        of the arts and humanities respondents give one-quarter or more such &quot;below-standard-performance&quot; 
        As. In contrast, math and science grades are comparatively low, even though 
        more math and science teachers (93 percent) give &quot;undeserved&quot; 
        As and fully 37 percent give at least one-quarter such As. Social science 
        grading falls in the middle. For below-standard Bs, there's a roughly 
        similar pattern across academic divisions.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The big question is why nearly all Bowdoin teachers violate, 
        and many routinely violate, &quot;legislated&quot; standards. Our open-ended 
        questions seeking explanations elicited diverse, thought provoking, and 
        often eloquent responses. Due to space limitations, I will indicate just 
        the most frequent responses from those teachers who award at least 25 
        percent of As and Bs to students with below-standard work. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More than half of those who award many below-standard As 
        stress that it is not reasonable to expect &quot;exceptional creativity 
        and originality&quot; in some courses, particularly at the introductory 
        level. From this perspective, the problem is with the Catalogue definition. 
        However, one-third of this group articulate strategic motives for giving 
        &quot;easy&quot; As. These rationales range from a frank desire for good 
        course evaluations and high enrollments to the common view that it is 
        not smart (or fair) to diverge too far from college-wide practice. <br>
        Among the many respondents who frequently give Bs for below-standard work, 
        three-fourths sounded variations on the theme that B is Bowdoin's de facto 
        norm for competent-&quot;average&quot;-performance. But here, too, one-third 
        of the responses were colored by strategic thinking, akin to the logic 
        for giving below-standard As.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The search for systematic differences across the academic 
        ranks (non-tenure track, tenure track, tenured) turned up nothing dramatic 
        or statistically significant. For example, these self-reported data do 
        not support the hypothesis that tenure-track faculty &quot;go easy&quot; 
        on students to bolster their enrollments and teaching evaluations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What practical insights can we take from the responses? 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most basically, the disparities in grading practices among 
        faculty and the divergence between Catalogue standards and common practice 
        argue for a broad stakeholder dialogue?including students?about appropriate 
        standards and how to apply them equitably and consistently, particularly 
        across disciplines and course levels.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Specifically, in the name of intellectual and moral integrity, 
        we should lower either grade distributions or the Catalogue standards 
        (or both). The solution will not be simple. For instance, keeping current 
        Catalogue standards but lowering grades would paradoxically require the 
        biggest downward adjustment in math and science, which already have lower 
        grades than the other divisions.<br>
        De facto, Bowdoin's grading has collapsed to a two point system. This 
        spring the faculty will consider the marginal refinement of adding plus 
        and minus grades. Since many faculty currently round grades upward and 
        since Cs are widely viewed as punitive, pluses and minuses, in my view, 
        would help- a little- to make grades better reflect differential performance 
        and to enhance fairness.<br>
      </p>

        questions, will be made available on a website.<br>
