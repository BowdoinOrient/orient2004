      <p align="left">If high ability students possess a distinct advantage in 
        the competition for grades, then attaining high grades can be a straightforward 
        means to signal ability level to interested outside observers (prospective 
        employers, graduate schools, etc.). However, for grades to provide a significant 
        amount of information to outsiders, it is necessary that lower ability 
        students not be able to feign high ability by achieving a high grade point 
        average. Unfortunately, this is exactly what is currently happening at 
        Bowdoin due to rampant grade inflation.<br>
        Grade inflation results in fewer distinctions between students since nearly 
        everyone receives high grades regardless of ability (see accompanying 
        statistics). Consequently, the information content of grades is severely 
        degraded. About the only information communicated by grades in such an 
        environment is that the few students whose transcripts notably lack A's 
        are quite unlikely to be high ability. Thus, high grades are reduced to 
        a necessary condition for serious consideration for employment, or admission 
        to attractive graduate programs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The information loss associated with grade inflation has 
        a number of undesirable effects. Not only are high ability students harmed 
        by the destruction of the signaling function of grades but employers, 
        and others, lacking the objective information that could be provided by 
        non-inflated grades, must turn to other strategies for identifying high 
        ability individuals. The importance of connections is enhanced. Statistical 
        discrimination is a more likely occurrence. (Statistical discrimination 
        occurs when employers make hiring decisions based not on an individual's 
        qualities, but on the statistical characteristics of the individual's 
        gender, race, ethnic origin, athletic affiliations, etc.) In addition, 
        graduate school admissions will be based more heavily on letters of recommendation, 
        which emphasizes whom, as opposed to what, a student knows.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is also probable that high ability students will recognize 
        that there is little payoff to excelling. Their attention to academic 
        pursuits will likely be diminished resulting in a decline in the intellectual 
        environment at the College. These consequences of grade inflation harm 
        us all. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Any information provided by grades in a college-wide inflationary 
        environment is further degraded by differential grade inflation. When 
        departments across campus employ dramatically different grading standards, 
        course selection as much as ability determines grade point averages, and 
        it becomes impossible to render comparative ability judgments based on 
        grades. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That differential grade inflation is a problem at Bowdoin 
        is clear (see accompanying statistics). Of course, it might be argued 
        that the higher grades in some departments are due to a greater concentration 
        of high ability students in those departments. The logic of a signaling 
        model, however, suggests that the opposite is almost certainly the case.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Relatively weaker students most need opportunities to mask 
        their true ability level through attainment of high grades. Hoping to 
        enhance their GPAs, they will gravitate to departments offering the combination 
        of high mean/low variance grading. Conversely, high ability students benefit 
        from the opportunity to distinguish themselves, and so, on the margin, 
        will be attracted to departments offering higher variance grading.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The predicted result is, therefore, an inverse relationship 
        between grades and student ability across departments. Unfortunately, 
        outsiders do not possess the information necessary to distinguish departments 
        based on grading practices. So important information that could be conveyed, 
        for example, by major, is not available to those who need it. Again, when 
        the objective information grades could provide is eliminated, employers, 
        and others, will resort to more subjective, and potentially problematic, 
        alternative screening mechanisms. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is worth noting that some have argued that current high 
        mean/low variance grading practices are due to a secular increase in student 
        quality, and thus not a problem. Even if student quality has improved, 
        however, the need for outsiders to acquire information regarding relative 
        ability remains. That is, employers and others may be quite pleased that 
        the overall pool from which they select is of enhanced quality, but be 
        assured that they still have a strong interest in identifying an individual's 
        relative ranking in the pool. So the fact that student quality may have 
        improved does not eliminate the important signaling function of grades.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Neither Bowdoin, nor American higher education more generally, 
        possesses any sort of general exit evaluation of graduating seniors. Among 
        other things, this assures that empirical verification of the preceding 
        analysis is essentially impossible. The theoretical conclusions are, however, 
        unambiguous. To the extent that signaling analysis is applicable, grade 
        inflation must have highly undesirable implications.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The obvious solution to grade inflation is institution of 
        a rigid grading curve. However, we suspect that such a proposal would 
        be unpopular. The most feasible alternative is to increase the information 
        content in grades by attaching benchmark information to student transcripts. 
        Providing interested outsiders with information about grade distributions 
        in a student's major department, as well as the College, would enhance 
        signal quality and enable departments to offer students the benefits of 
        high variance grading.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Interestingly, signaling theory implies that this strategy 
        could produce grade deflation as departments attempted to attract the 
        high ability students who most benefit from a tough grading policy. Perhaps 
        counter-intuitively, the winners would be Bowdoin's most able and diligent 
        students since our grades would provide the outside world with information 
        not available regarding students at other schools.</p>
