      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever caught the wind with a crack of the sails and 
        felt a boat lurch beneath you as it seized onto the gusts? Ever felt the 
        sunlight whip around you the same way the wind does? How about when that 
        wind dies, a cloud devours the sun, and you're left with nothing but the 
        gray ocean mildly lapping at your thwarted sailboat? What do you do then?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; My backup plan is my sister. She isn't an accomplished sailor, 
        nor is she an Olympic swimmer. She doesn't even have divine command over 
        the elements. In fact, her presence would doubtlessly have no physical 
        effect on the situation at hand. So why Katherine? Well, it's simple really: 
        she's a goofball fueled with a boundless supply of creativity. Presented 
        with the situation, she would probably spring up, whirl to the front of 
        the boat, and entice the rest of us into playing pirates. Though we may 
        be stranded for hours, the situation would never be bleak, never boring. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this isn't a story glorifying my sister's comical 
        personality. I want to bring to light a tragedy that could have been avoided. 
        This past weekend at Colgate University, four students died in a car crash 
        on the short drive home from a party. It was raining, and the driver and 
        his two friends picked up four girls who had just started to climb up 
        the long hill back to their dorm. The car hit a tree, spun around, and 
        skidded into another tree. Three were ejected from the car, and when everything 
        came to a rest, three of the girls and one of the boys were dead, two 
        were unconscious, and one had to look on the ruin that lay before him 
        as he waited for help to arrive. There was no going back, no possibility 
        of undoing the situation. I am sure, though, that one person in particular 
        would change one decision that he made that night, if he were ever given 
        that chance. He wouldn't have gotten into that car drunk, he wouldn't 
        have turned the keys, he wouldn't have put his foot on the gas, and he 
        wouldn't have lost four of his friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While the news is devastating, my first thought upon hearing 
        it was one of relief. You see, my sister goes to Colgate. Had she been 
        there, I am certain she would have accepted the ride if she didn't know 
        the driver was drunk. Wouldn't anyone? It's a quarter-mile climb up that 
        hill, and it was raining. It really made me realize how lucky I am for 
        every second I have with my family and my friends.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I have met such interesting and caring people in my life, 
        and I know I don't tell them enough how much I love them. I find that 
        I've come to accept their company as a given, and I often put off really 
        getting to know them until that time when I have fewer assignments, less 
        commitments. But they might not be here tomorrow. I might not be here 
        tomorrow. I'd better take every chance I have to love my sister, because 
        I'll need those memories for those times when I'm alone, when the wind 
        has died, and the clouds have devoured the sun…. for those times when 
        I'm just drifting. </p>
