      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Monday representatives from industrialized nations 
        gathered at The Hague in the Netherlands to hammer out an agreement for 
        implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement reached in 1997 that 
        outlines standards for greenhouse gas emissions. Under this agreement, 
        the United States was supposed to reduce its emissions to seven percent 
        below 1990 levels by the year 2012. Regrettably, the U.S. Senate never 
        ratified this treaty and therefore our nation has not been obligated to 
        reduce emissions. Given our status as the world's leading producer of 
        carbon dioxide, arguably the most harmful greenhouse gas, the United States' 
        apathy and inaction are shameful. We must accept accountability for our 
        pollution and set a good example for other nations, especially developing 
        countries which are beginning to burn fossil fuels at alarming rates.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change, otherwise known as global warming, threatens 
        to drive species to extinction, increase extreme weather incidents, melt 
        polar ice caps, raise sea levels, flood coastal communities, increase 
        the spread of disease, push ecosystems northward, and devastate critical 
        habitat. The scientific community generally agrees that climate change 
        is not a natural phenomenon, but rather a direct consequence of anthropogenic 
        greenhouse gases. The 1990s have been the warmest decade on record, and 
        climatologists forecast that global surface temperature will increase 
        between 2.7 and 6.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. By comparison, 
        the temperature difference between today and the peak of the last Ice 
        Age-about 20,000 years ago-is only 9 degrees Fahrenheit. As the World 
        Wildlife Fund explains, "Greenhouse gas emissions are now exceeding the 
        capacity of natural systems like forests and oceans to absorb them."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Here at Bowdoin, the college's community has participated 
        in several events this fall aimed at voicing concern for global warming 
        to elected officials. Student interns for Green Corps, the environmental 
        school for grassroots organizing, have coordinated these activities. In 
        September, students called the White House, demanding that President Clinton 
        take a tougher stance on greenhouse gas emissions. In October, students 
        emailed world leaders, urging them to attend The Hague and commit to rigorous 
        reductions. Just last week, students enjoyed EcoJam, a combination concert/raffle/informational 
        fair in Smith Union that raised awareness of climate change. On Tuesday 
        the 21st there will be a rally protesting global warming in Portland, 
        with vans leaving from the Polar Bear at 11:30am. All are welcome and 
        urged to attend. Hopefully the persistence and voice of Bowdoin students 
        will pay off this week as leaders at The Hague negotiate the health and 
        future of the earth's environment. </p>
