      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ciao. Hola. Bonjour. Ni hao. Kalimera. Zdravstvuite. Jambo. 
        Konichiwa. Sekoh. Aloha. Shalom. P‰iv‰‰.. Hello. Hey. Hi. Howdy. Wassup? 
        How you doin? (The last being my personal favorite, spoken, of course, 
        with an eyebrow raise and a hint of suggestion).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, before I research and find the way to say hello in 
        a hundred other languages, I'll stop there and leave the list at some 
        of the ways you could possibly greet someone, be it in Italian, Spanish, 
        French, Chinese, Greek, Russian, Swahili, Japanese, Mohawk, Hawaiian, 
        Hebrew, Finnish, English, or Bowdoin lingo. But to what end do I list 
        the possibilities of greetings that exist in spoken languages? They are 
        listed with the full intention of having them employed around the Bowdoin 
        campus. That's right. Since people at Bowdoin don't quite know how to 
        say hello, pick your favorite and utilize it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We Bowdoin students seem to be engaged in an unspoken showdown 
        here, living out some wild fantasy of Western shoot outs as if we ourselves 
        were starring in the The Quick and the Dead. Our weapons are not guns, 
        but simple hellos, and the game: to determine who utters the first word 
        when passing each other. Giving in and offering up the initial salutation 
        is to die, as firing a hello is the greatest faux pas on this campus. 
        To speak or not to speak is undoubtedly the most complicated question 
        around.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It is without a doubt the dilemma of whether or not you should 
        say hello to someone you see in passing. Do I know this person well enough? 
        I don't know this person at all, should I still smile and say hi? I recognize 
        this person, but they probably don't know me, is a hello appropriate? 
        All of these questions run through your mind in the split second that 
        you have to decide whether or not you will engage in a simple hello with 
        this person. And the answer that Bowdoin defaults to: let's pretend I 
        never even saw the person. That's right, the "I didn't even notice you 
        were there" excuse. "I wasn't looking at you, but rather the silly leprechaun 
        dancing on your shoulder." Sure. That's believable.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The Quad inevitably brings to light all the reservations you 
        have about greeting people. For it is on the quad that you cannot readily 
        avert your eyes from someone who is oncoming, on the same (oh, unlucky 
        you) walkway as yourself. It's all so familiar: you're walking swiftly 
        to class, pretending to be in a rush as an excuse to not say hello. You 
        see an oncoming student, you think you remember this person from a party 
        from last weekend, the key word being, of course, that you "think." You 
        don't contemplate the fact that you are not going to say hello to this 
        person. The dilemma: how do I make it look like I didn't notice them? 
        I could a) stare at the pavement. Who knows, it could have changed color 
        since the last time you walked on it or maybe there's this big pebble 
        waiting to trip you up; or, b) look at your watch, even though you know 
        you are not wearing one; or, c) check up on your hectic schedule by pulling 
        out your assignment book from its convenient location in your over-the-shoulder 
        sash. The most utilized option: making sure that the ground suddenly does 
        not disappear from under your feet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If that's what you decide to do, why not look up to 1) make 
        yourself look like you're permanently out to lunch and 2) make sure the 
        sky doesn't fall down on you. Obviously, the answer to all of these ridiculous 
        aversions would be to simply say hello to people in passing, even if you 
        don't know them. A smile and a friendly greeting are sure to get you a 
        long way on this campus, and, if nothing else, it will elevate you above 
        the Western gun fight we are constantly dueling. Don't worry if the person 
        you say hi to doesn't respond-they are probably too busy watching leprechauns.
