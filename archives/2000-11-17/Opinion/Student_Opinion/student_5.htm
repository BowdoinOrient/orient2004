      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked my head up out of the pool of Guinness I have been 
        floating in lately to realize that my country doesn't have a president-elect. 
        The debacle that was and continues to be (as of 14th November) the Florida 
        election has provided me with plenty of entertainment and a feeling of 
        immense satisfaction. Why immense satisfaction out of this seemingly unsatisfactory 
        situation? I will try to answer that to your…liking. You see, I have been 
        one of the hated - if you've read the pre-, and I imagine post-election 
        Orient articles - Naderites or Nader Raiders or Ralphing Nads (if you 
        really want to hurt my feelings) since this spring; the ones that were 
        supposed to spoil the election for Gore. Even here in Ireland, my support 
        for Nader was answered by the "a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush" argument 
        in some form or other, from Americans and Europeans alike. Most of the 
        time, that was that; any attempt to explain myself almost always fell 
        on deaf Gore-supporting ears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In a very few cases, the fact that I was registered in Massachusetts 
        (yes! A Bowdoin student from MA!), a Gore-safe state, seemed to mitigate 
        this crime. But much worse were my ideological reasons for voting Nader, 
        such as utter repulsion from Bush and his massacre of the English language 
        and not-quite-utter-but-really-very-thorough repulsion from Gore and his 
        disheartening dash to the center or my disgust with the reek of corporate 
        interests emanating from both major candidates. These merely elicited 
        remarks of "…but Bush for four years?!?" etc. Even my political science 
        teacher from high school, who despite his occupation's necessity for impartiality 
        in the classroom, always decorated the walls of his class with posters 
        of JFK and Eugene McCarthy, informed me, however reluctantly, that his 
        vote was going to Gore as well.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;After such harassment and disillusionment, this narrow margin 
        of votes between "the robot and the moron" (love that one) only serves 
        to prove Nader right all along: that the two candidates are far too similar; 
        and that Gore did blow the election (an incumbent VP with the best economy 
        in years should win in a landslide versus a simpleton with one of the 
        worst gubernatorial records in the States). The sweet smell of vindication 
        still hangs in the air.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I then turned to Bowdoin College, home of Maine's Greens founder 
        John Rensenbrink and an environmentally-aware campus, for some back up; 
        some voices that would restore my confidence in the voting public. Imagine 
        my surprise a few days after the election when I opened to the Opinion 
        section of the October 20 Orient kindly mailed by the Off-Campus Studies 
        office (thank you)…No, I'm not talking about the exposé on long lines 
        in Thorne Dining Hall, although I was quite upset at that too. I am referring 
        to the manner in which multiple articles denouncing Nader and imploring 
        Greens to back Gore. One writer even expressed desire for Nader to "drop 
        out and publicly - and I mean very publicly - endorse Gore with all his 
        might." Is he talking about a naked Nader press conference at the 50-yard 
        line during half time of Monday Night Football? How public and how mighty 
        did he want this endorsement?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;All this defeatist (defended as "realistic") political advice 
        about choosing the lesser of two evils to avoid the election of W really 
        disheartened me. Why doesn't Gore have to earn your vote, whereas it seems 
        as though you really have to believe in Nader to vote Green? What happened 
        to voting your conscience? Or, more "realistically," what happened to 
        strategic voting, at the very least? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you may ignore this trans-Atlantic rant of mine since 
        it is coming after the election, but to do that would be to ignore what 
        Nader was running for. The Green party wasn't running Nader to win. Third 
        parties barely ever run to win. (Psst! That's why it's called a "two-party 
        system"). The Greens (and Libertarians, Socialists, etc.) run their campaigns 
        to raise issues. They attempt to open up political discourse because the 
        major players have attempted, and in this campaign succeeded in suppressing 
        outside political views. Even Ralph Nader, shortly after the results came 
        in that there was evidence of him "spoiling" the race for Gore, stated 
        that he and the Greens were mobilizing a progressive movement with long-term 
        goals. In the angry shouts of Zach de la Rocha, "it has to start somewhere, 
        it has to start sometime, what better place than here, what better time 
        than now." The reform and progress the Greens hope to achieve is gaining 
        its energy from events like Seattle and Prague and Washington D.C. This 
        is a process that will go on longer than the four-year term of Bush or 
        Gore (it will be four grid-locked years, whoever wins). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that many people have ignored the fact that the system 
        and its inherent corruption will go on longer than any Gore or Bush administration. 
        Yes, Bush's plans make any half-way intelligent person wonder how such 
        man could even be nominated as president. And yes, Gore "is a heck of 
        a lot greener than Bush," but what happens if the voices of Greens and 
        other outsiders continue to silence their true opinions (as the low Green 
        results indicate happened on the 7th) and just go along for four years, 
        eight years, or more? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't take a Bowdoin education to see that Bush is probably 
        the least qualified presidential candidate for decades, maybe ever. But 
        Gore also supports the death penalty, he has continually downplayed his 
        environmental roots, he supported the nomination of conservative Justices 
        Scalia and Thomas, he plans to increase military spending, he will continue 
        the pathetic war on drugs in the same failing manner, and he took almost 
        as much money from corporate interests as did Bush. Under Bush or Gore, 
        the political discourse will remain centrist and unoffending to the middle 
        class and the "undecideds" of America. We will not hear about gay rights, 
        while only one state recognizes civil unions for gay and lesbian couples. 
        We will not hear about universal health care, while millions of children 
        go {ithout and suffer the consequences. We will not hear about drug law 
        reform, while our prison population swells with 85% of all convicts incarcerated 
        for non-violent drug offenses. <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;A vote for Nader wasn't a wasted vote. It wasn't a vote for 
        Bush. It didn't cost Gore the election (that was Gore's own doing). On 
        November 7th, a vote for Nader was a vote for reclaiming our democracy, 
        for environmental friendliness, for change and reform. But it was only 
        the beginning of a new progressive movement. </p>
