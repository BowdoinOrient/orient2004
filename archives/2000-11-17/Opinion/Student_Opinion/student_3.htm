      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;School sucks right now. Don't you agree? Yeah, I know you 
        do. It seems as if every single person on this campus (with the exception 
        of one of my roommates who had time to watch two "X-Files" episodes last 
        night) is swamped with work, stress, and worry. Not only have I had to 
        read books, write papers, and attend meeting upon meeting, but I was sick 
        on Sunday, AT&T cut off my phone service (their fault, not mine), and 
        my grandmother had a heart attack last night. Does everything have to 
        happen this week?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, I have had to do loads of work over Thanksgiving 
        Break, but, this year, my wonderful professors (you know who you are!) 
        have decided to take it easy. This is good, inasmuch as my Thanksgiving 
        "break" will be shorter than my Fall "break." (I took two extra "mental 
        health days" at the beginning and at the end of Fall Break, which is why 
        it was so long.) And I can only imagine the poor students who have to 
        travel farther than I do: our schedule releases us on the day before Thanksgiving 
        (who the hell goes to class that day, anyway?), which makes it exceptionally 
        hard for many of us to travel home. I know we've debated it and debated 
        it, but I just thought I'd twist the dagger even more. So, here's a shout-out 
        to the people who plan the schedule: YO! Give us a break! Literally! I 
        mean, an actual break, where we are granted more than a simple turnaround 
        trip! As much as I love driving five hours to go home, spending three 
        days, and then driving back, it would be nice for us to perhaps - gasp! 
        - have the whole week off! Hmmm. Yeah. And then once we get back, we have 
        to plow through more work, more tests, more exams...Last year, I got the 
        flu the day before Reading Period ended. Could this time of year suck 
        any more? Bring on December!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;School is going really well right now. It's senior year and 
        I've never been busier, but I'm amazed that I'm handling it all. A few 
        weeks ago, I wrote a seven-page paper in 48 minutes! I could have never 
        done that when I was in high school! If Bowdoin has taught me anything, 
        it's taught me how to be efficient. I've had some really good Writing 
        Project meetings this week, and I'm slowly recovering from the gastrointestinal 
        mess that overshadowed the latter half of my weekend. On Saturday night, 
        I'd like to go see "Best in Show" again - would anyone like to come with?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm glad that I'll be spending time with family this Thanksgiving. 
        My grandmother had a heart attack last night, but we're planning, if all 
        goes well, to spend the holiday with her and my aunt in New Jersey. On 
        Friday, I might go visit my friends Ira and Julie and their baby, Ryan, 
        who's not much of a baby anymore. I saw a picture of him a few weeks ago, 
        toddling around and playing on the slide. He's cute as a button, that 
        Ryan. It's going to be a short holiday, to be sure, but I won't have a 
        lot of work to do. And, hey - once we come back, there will only be three 
        more weeks until they let us loose again!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;On January 10, instead of returning to the Bowdoin classroom 
        for my final semester here, I'll be student teaching in an eighth grade 
        classroom up in Richmond. I've been hanging out with these eighth graders 
        since September, and I can't wait to spend five days a week there. It 
        should be fun, tiring, exciting, confusing...It should really put my knowledge, 
        endurance, compassion, and motivation to the test. What a perfect way 
        to end my time at Bowdoin: by not being at Bowdoin exactly, but having 
        enough of this place inside of me and surrounding me that I can feel confident 
        enough to go out into the real world. It's a good feeling, a nice feeling. 
        Bring on December! </p>
