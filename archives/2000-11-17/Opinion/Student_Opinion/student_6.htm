      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, Thanksgiving break is almost upon us, the implications 
        of which for many of us include: Days off from class! Football! Time to 
        work on papers/problem sets! Food! Imperialist clichés about "giving thanks!" 
        For some, these days mean SHOPPING. Friday, Nov. 24 will be, without question, 
        the absolute hugest shopping day of 2000-the consumerist tradition of 
        day-after Thanksgiving shopping has indeed existed for years. This year, 
        it's time to make a change; celebrate BUY NOTHING DAY on Nov. 24th, sponsored 
        by the Bowdoin Democratic Socialists. We urge you to either avoid making 
        purchases or seriously reconsider the necessity and use of what you're 
        planning to buy.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, you're probably thinking to yourself: why does 
        this matter to me? Well, consider the fact that about 20 percent of the 
        world's population devours 80 percent of its resources. Consumer culture 
        runs rampant in this country; it is shoved down our throats as we walk 
        through cities, watch TV, or surf the internet. On a more practical note, 
        shopping on Nov. 24th entails traipsing through malls, talking to irritable 
        people, dealing with traffic, and spending your hard-earned money. Consider 
        your less-consumerist (and more relaxing) options. As noted by AdBusters, 
        "BUY NOTHING DAY is a simple idea with deep implications. It forces us 
        to think about the 'shop-till-you-drop' imperative and its effects on 
        the rest of the world. On Buy Nothing Day enjoy a break from the shopping 
        frenzy. Relish your power as a consumer to change the economic environment." 
        So, use your brain instead of your wallet and feel empowered!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Buy Nothing Campaign in Seattle distributed 
        the following checklist to allow shoppers to consider things they were 
        thinking of buying.</p>
      <p>-Do I need it? <br>
        -How many do I already have? <br>
        -How much will I use it? -How long will it last?<br>
        -Could I borrow it from a friend or family member? <br>
        -Can I do without it? <br>
        -Am I able to clean, lubricate and/or maintain it myself? <br>
        -Am I willing to? <br>
        -Will I be able to repair it?<br>
        -Have I researched it to get the best quality for the best price? <br>
        -How will I dispose of it when I'm done using it? <br>
        -Are the resources that went into it renewable or nonrenewable? <br>
        -Is it made or recycled materials, and is it recyclable? <br>
        -Is there anything that I already own that I could substitute for it? 
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, consider your options. Give gifts of:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;TIME: We all know how difficult it is to find time to spend 
        with friends and family. Use the time you would have spent standing in 
        line and signing credit card receipts to actually have a conversation 
        over coffee, cocoa, tea, or what have you.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;SERVICE: At a time when emphasis is placed on the accumulation 
        of stuff, remember that people exist who cannot afford to purchase a meal, 
        much less a CD burner. Donate your time or funds in the name of friends 
        or relatives to nonprofit groups that truly need these items, rather than 
        multi-billion-dollar corporations. Or, consider handing out those nifty 
        chore coupons (you know, the ones that offer "one free car wash" or "one 
        free homemade dinner").<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;SELF: Hopefully by now we're beginning to realize that those 
        cheesy homemade gifts really are more appreciated than any amount of plastic 
        stuff. Choose to write a poem, frame a little sketch, knit a hat, or recite 
        a monologue. Not only will they bring tears to the eyes of your more sensitive 
        friends and relatives, but these gifts are also relaxing to produce!<br>
