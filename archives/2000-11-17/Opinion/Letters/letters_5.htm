      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Orient has printed numerous attacks on conservatives 
        and conservative ideas. Earlier in the year, the editors wrote a scathing 
        review of the talk Lawrence Lindsey '76 gave on the economic and social 
        gains this country would acquire under a Bush Administration. It insinuated 
        that Mr. Lindsey brought shame and dishonor to his Bowdoin degree by supporting 
        a candidate who did not seem, in the eyes of the Orient editors, to serve 
        "the common good." Both the College Democrat and Republican groups on 
        campus condemned this editorial for being unfair, nasty, and inappropriate 
        at a college that claims to support diversity. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, despite the efforts of both political organizations, 
        this newspaper and some of its writers have failed to learn the lesson 
        that personal slander against a candidate and its supporters is not an 
        acceptable way to represent an opinion. Specifically, I am criticizing 
        the pre-election editorial that portrayed Gov. Bush's face on a Budweiser 
        label and last week's column by Gyllian Christiansen in which she equates 
        College Republicans to "guests on the Ricki Lake Show." Do Ms. Christiansen 
        and this newspaper realize that these few "out-of-work actors" represent 
        an organization of over fifty individuals who proudly and openly call 
        themselves Republicans? This does not even include people who would like 
        to claim allegiance to the Republican party but who are scared to as a 
        result of the fear of social ostracization that this newspaper seems to 
        endorse implicitly. As we stated earlier this year, we are not evil, we 
        do not want to put a gun in every child's hand, and we do not want to 
        destroy the environment. In our organization, most members even take the 
        position of supporting a woman's right to choose. Our organization also 
        was one of the first student groups to endorse Question 6, the ballot-initiative 
        that unfortunately failed passage. This question would have given fundamental 
        civil rights to homosexuals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;These beliefs may surprise many readers and hopefully some 
        editors and contributors to this newspaper. Some might not understand 
        how most people in our organization openly endorsed Governor Bush for 
        the presidency. I will not take the liberty of explaining everybody's 
        reasons for supporting Bush. I can say, though, that with the exception 
        perhaps of the abortion issue and maybe Question 6 (even there I think 
        there is more ambiguity than liberals would have you believe), the same 
        can be said for Governor Bush. However, one's reasons for supporting Gov. 
        Bush are obviously personal and it would be inappropriate of me to ascribe 
        beliefs to an entire organization. However, I can say strictly for myself 
        that I reconciled differences between my own beliefs and Gov. Bush's beliefs 
        by reminding myself that he is interested in seeing more freedoms go to 
        the individual and fewer to the federal government. His tax, social security, 
        and education plans, plus his desire to increase our military readiness, 
        convinced me that he was better than the three other candidates running. 
        Some members of Bowdoin's faculty share these beliefs. In addition, many 
        distinguished scholars at other institutions endorsed Bush, including 
        some Nobel laureates.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I know that these arguments on all sides of the election have 
        saturated this campus and the nation. I imagine many students are tired 
        of hearing them. However, if you are one of those who enjoy making disparaging 
        remarks about Republicans, I hope that you realize that not only are you 
        demeaning a legitimate point of view, but you are also denouncing the 
        principles of diversity that this campus rightfully holds to be sacrosanct. 
        Would this campus stand for such prejudiced commentary if the victim were 
        black, homosexual, or any other minority? I would hope not and trust that 
        on this campus I would be correct. Why is the standard different for intelligent 
        political disagreements? Let us remember that it is one thing to disagree 
        on issues. This is acceptable and should be encouraged in a liberal arts 
        environment. However, writing that implies a group of people holding an 
        opinion are stupid, crosses the line from critique to slander and should 
        not be tolerated. I look forward to more intelligent discourse with my 
        more liberal colleagues on this campus for the next two years in the hope 
        that diversity can be represented not only by skin color but also by a 
        plurality of ideas. </p>
