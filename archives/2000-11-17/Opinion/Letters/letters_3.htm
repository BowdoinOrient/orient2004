      <p>To the Bowdoin Community: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week's opinion article by Edward Bair, in addition to 
        many recent comments around campus and in the media, expressed a desire 
        to dismantle the time-honored Electoral College. I feel compelled to use 
        this space to offer a different perspective on the method of electing 
        the President of the United States. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the current Electoral College system offers 
        many advantages over a popular vote. In our republic, a citizen who resides 
        in a state with low population deserves just as much representation as 
        a citizen in a city. Though at first glance it may seem that a popular 
        vote would grant an equal voice to each, in fact, it would eliminate it. 
        Population centers would grab nearly all the consideration, as the number 
        of popular votes in the farmlands of the country is measly compared to 
        someplace like Boston. Why would a candidate bother with states with low 
        populations? Even if the state were hotly contested, it still wouldn't 
        really matter tactically. A small number of votes separating the two candidates 
        in that state, would be virtually erased as the votes were thrown in with 
        all the rest from all over the country. With candidates unconcerned about 
        the interests of the sparsely populated areas of the country, national 
        economic interests would be at risk and the country would splinter. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Electoral College, who would care to campaign 
        in North Dakota? If this last election had been decided with a popular 
        vote, Bush would have stayed in areas like Texas and the South, and Gore 
        in the urban centers of the country. Each would have-as would be the tactically 
        intelligent thing to do under a popular vote system-simply attempted to 
        increase voter turnout where they stood to gain many votes and ignore 
        the areas they wouldn't yield many. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This nation is made up of a group of states with widely dissimilar 
        interests. Currently, a candidate has to attempt to appeal to as broad 
        a spectrum of these as he can in order to get elected. With a popular 
        vote, a candidate could simply create a message that would appeal to his 
        primary constituency in extremely targeted small areas and try for a large 
        volume of voters there. The Electoral College does reflect the relative 
        populations of states via the different number of electors granted each. 
        It does this in a manner that gives each state a distinct voice, one that 
        reflects its relative size but also makes sure no state is silenced, as 
        some would be under a popular vote. The Electoral College ensures that 
        candidates campaign to the entire country and safeguards the importance 
        of each state's voice, be it large or small.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Many blame the Electoral College for the current debacle in 
        Florida. However, a popular vote system would have had the current recounting 
        and potential legal battles that are isolated to a few areas now being 
        played out in most every county across the country. With such a tight 
        race popularly, a potential vote or two different in every county (even 
        those that went strongly one way or the other) could, together, change 
        the outcome of the election. Recount after recount of every ballot in 
        the entire country would have to ensue to ensure an accurate number, making 
        the process of electing a president too tedious and expensive for even 
        the most civic-minded among us. Additionally, the potential for fraud 
        would increase dramatically within such a structure. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Electoral College could stand updating 
        in a few select areas. Regulations against faithless electors, levied 
        on a state level, could alleviate some reservations about the system, 
        though the actual occurrence of electors voting contrary to the will of 
        their state has been historically extremely low. Furthermore, I believe 
        that states that want to follow the lead of Nebraska and Maine and allow 
        the potential for splitting their electoral vote should be encouraged 
        to do so. It is imperative that these types of reforms occur on the state 
        level, however. Federal imposition of election regulations on states would 
        further diminish the too often overlooked identity of each state as different 
        from all other United States. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of full disclosure, I actually am one of those 
        curiosities on the Bowdoin campus: a Bush voter. (Thanks so much to last 
        week's editorial, which so graciously admitted that I am, as a Bush voter, 
        "not necessarily evil or stupid." I suppose that is about as rational 
        a message as one can expect on that topic at Bowdoin.) Convenient though 
        it may seem now, I have been a consistent proponent of the Electoral College, 
        even prior to November 7 when the conventional wisdom was that Bush would 
        win the popular vote but that the electoral vote was up for grabs. My 
        home state of Maryland, true to its consistently Democratic form, went 
        to Gore. Regardless, I prefer to cast my ballot in a state where I know 
        I won't end up in the majority, rather in one where I have some allegiance 
        to myhome, than as just one vote in an entire nation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The Electoral College safeguards the interests of the country 
        by ensuring that the interests of all areas of the country are taken into 
        consideration as legitimate actors by the candidates. It serves the purpose 
        of fairly electing a President better than a popular vote would. The Electoral 
        College, save some potential changes on a state-by-state basis, was an 
        extremely intelligent mode of running elections when the Founding Fathers 
        established it, and it still is today. </p>
