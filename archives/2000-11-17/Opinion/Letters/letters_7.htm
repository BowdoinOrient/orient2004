      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the single worst articles I have read in my entire 
        life, Gyllian Christiansen has brought the Orient to a new low. Her article, 
        "Electing a prez, is it worth it?," in last week's issue, not only has 
        a ridiculous premise, but also lacks support of any kind for that premise<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I present first Ms. Christiansen's opening statement: "As 
        the possibility of this election ever resulting in an actual President 
        becomes more and more remote…and once you throw Buchanan mis-votes and 
        overseas ballots into the mix, it almost doesn't seem worth it." Are you 
        serious? This is one of the most ignorant comments I have ever heard. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in our lives we can see a truly close election 
        in which every vote really does count. No American can ever say again 
        that their vote doesn't matter. Personally, I think that if this is handled 
        well, and the process of law is respected, then this can be a great thing 
        for American democracy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This election most definitely will result in an "actual President." 
        It may take a while, but that is perfectly legitimate. The Presidency 
        is a serious matter, and I would hope that those in charge would take 
        their time making sure of the outcome.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Christiansen wrote in her article, "without a decisive 
        victor, it's becoming challenging for students to complain one way or 
        another." Well, she seems to have found something to complain about without 
        any difficulty, and it is disappointing. I hate to think that with something 
        so unique as what we are witnessing here, the only thing that Ms. Christiansen 
        can think of is that it isn't worth it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;We are witnessing the power of democracy, of 225 years of 
        history, and the expression of self in the selecting of our leaders. There 
        are plenty of places in this world where this does not happen, and we 
        should be grateful that we live in a place that does let us choose. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;whole process up in terms that Bowdoin students could understand: 
        'I'm too tired to think about this election anymore. When it's all over, 
        I think it will just be like one of those bad hookups you wake up from 
        in the morning and wonder about.'" Well, I would hope that Ms. Slepian 
        does not speak for all of us, or even in terms that we can all "understand" 
        from personal experience and I'm not sure what that says about the Bowdoin 
        community, but I know that I don't like it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what would the solution be to this so-called problem 
        that we have? If electing a President doesn't seem worth it to you, Ms. 
        Christiansen, how would you recommend that we run our country? Perhaps 
        a dictator, or maybe a Stalinist regime, maybe someone who isn't elected, 
        but instead just seizes power? Saddam Hussein? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Christiansen, electing a president is most certainly worth 
        it. I care not for how long it takes, or ultimately who wins (though I 
        do have my preferences) so long as it is a fair, democratic election. 
        If there were anything that was ever "worth it," American democracy is 
        it. </p>
