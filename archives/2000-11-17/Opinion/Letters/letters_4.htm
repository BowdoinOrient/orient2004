      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last issue of the Orient, I appreciated Andy Shaw's 
        offering his thoughts, and I felt the need to respond to them. First, 
        I do not think the individual who was unruly can be isolated from his 
        group. Shaw described the situation as there being one individual who 
        was unruly. He was with a group, however, and by not keeping him in check 
        this group basically condoned his behavior. I believe it is fair of us 
        to criticize any group which allows its members to get out of line in 
        public, regardless of the group. It is often intimidating to be around 
        these groups of people, and intimidation is one of the most divisive forces 
        that exists on campus.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I agree with Shaw that stereotypes about athletes 
        are most of the time inaccurate and unfair, and that they lead to people 
        being mistreated. I think most people are with him on that one. Still, 
        if one wants to fight stereotypes, you should do it by showing that the 
        stereotypes are not true. When you keep members of your group in check, 
        you break the stereotypes that your group is often out of line. By defending 
        or attempting to isolate the actions of out-of-line individuals when those 
        actions involve the group, you reinforce such stereotypes. The very fact 
        that we discuss this issue shows our willingness to voice our opinions 
        and become engaged in our community in a way that will move us in a positive 
        direction. </p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Victor Johnson '01 </p>
