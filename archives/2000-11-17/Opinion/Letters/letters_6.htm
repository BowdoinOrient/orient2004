      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing to combat the recent tendency, not only in the 
        Orient, but also in the mass media to treat Ralph Nader more like a piñata 
        than a presidential candidate. As I write this article, George W. Bush 
        leads Al Gore in Florida by only 300 votes. An editor of the Orient blamed 
        Nader in last week's issue for Gore's impending defeat in Florida, citing 
        the 100,000 votes which Nader received in that state. I will concede that, 
        had Nader not been in the race, the Democrats would have been able to 
        find the 300 votes necessary to win Florida. It is short sighted, however, 
        to cite this fact as the reason for Gore's failure in this campaign.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Gore's shortcomings in the voting booth stem from the lack 
        of a campaign message. One of the first things a government student learns 
        when studying campaigns in an introductory course is that all campaigns 
        need a succinct, yet clear campaign message (thank you professor Hetherington). 
        Reagan ran on cutting taxes, balancing the budget, and increasing defense 
        spending. George Bush (the elder, and wiser?) said "read my lips, no new 
        taxes." With Bill Clinton, "it's the economy stupid." George W. wants 
        to give the power to the people, not the government. Now, I followed as 
        much political banter as I could get my hands on during the election. 
        Yes, I even suffered my way through the entirety of all three debates. 
        I still don't know what Gore's message was. Put elderly who use prescription 
        drugs in a lockbox? The top one percent of our country comprises the top 
        one percent of our country but the Governor's tax plan will give the top 
        50 percent of tax breaks to the people who own 75 percent of the money 
        of the one percent of the country? Gore spent too much time trying to 
        demonstrate his thorough grasp of the Washington nitty gritty politics 
        when the people didn't know what he stood for on the most basic level.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Al Gore was the Vice?President of an Administration during 
        eight of the best economic years (for the upper and middle classes) in 
        the history of the United States. He was running against a veritable political 
        neophyte from a state with one of the weakest governorships in the United 
        States. All his message had to be was: continue the economic prosperity 
        that I helped to start. Gore, instead, distanced himself from Bill Clinton 
        because of the association with immorality, despite Clinton's 60 percent 
        approval rating. In this act, Gore signed his own death warrant because 
        he had also distanced himself from the "economic prosperity" which is 
        also associated with the Administration. Gore risked all in the name of 
        being an alpha male. Yet he appeared very beta when he failed to carry 
        his home state. The eleven Tennessee electoral votes would have given 
        Gore a victory in the Electoral College, and all this Florida business 
        would be a moot point.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure many people are still thinking "Yeah, but if people 
        had just voted for Gore instead of Nader, he would have won." Once again, 
        I point to Gore who dropped the ball. Nader supports unions, the environment, 
        and less defense spending. He opposes corporate funding of elections, 
        the neo?colonialism of the WTO, and antienvironmentalist, anti?humanitarian 
        treaties such as NAFTA. These are all "liberal" positions. Where is Al 
        Gore? I understand that the vast majority of the undecided voters in the 
        United States are centrist. In order to garner these votes, Gore must 
        move to the middle. Gore's problem is that he did not try to extend the 
        party to include the centrist votes, but moved the entire party to the 
        right. He alienated his political base. Gore gave "liberals" no reason 
        to support him. Which brings me to the idea that a vote for Nader was 
        taking a vote away from Gore. A vote is given, not taken. These liberal 
        voters owe nothing to Al Gore, who has made a conscious decision not support 
        their views.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There are literally millions of different factors that would 
        have swung the 300 votes in Florida towards Gore, the most important of 
        which were his own campaign decisions. Ralph Nader has quite possibly 
        done more than any other citizen in the name of consumer rights. Before 
        you use him as a scapegoat, at whom you direct all of your anger, look 
        at all of the problems which Al Gore brought upon himself. If Al Gore 
        loses this election, the weight rests solely upon his own shoulders.</p>
