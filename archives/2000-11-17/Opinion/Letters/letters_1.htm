      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing in regards to the Editorial in last week's Orient 
        entitled "Maine is not Vermont - unfortunately." This editorial, while 
        very well written (kudos to the author), brings forth some very controversial 
        statements about those who would vote against Question 6. While I am not 
        a Maine voter (I voted absentee in my home state), I would have voted 
        against Question 6. This is not because I am anti-homosexual. It is not 
        because I am bigoted. It is not because I am hateful. It is most certainly 
        not because I am a white male who is financially comfortable. It is because 
        I believe in the U.S. Constitution; that document which we all (should) 
        venerate as being the highest law under which we live.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;First, I offer the First Amendment to the Constitution:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
        religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom 
        of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
        and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, while it does not explicitly mention gay rights, 
        is the basis for all implications that no non-fitness-to-task discrimination 
        tak place. Have you read it carefully? It doesn't say that Congress shall 
        make no law that discriminates. It says Congress shall make no law whatsoever. 
        None. Nothing. Nil.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;You want something more concrete? Many times Congress has 
        declared that it wants no part of ANY law that has to do with sexuality. 
        See, for example, USC Title 20, Chap. 70, SubChap. XIV, Part E, Sec. 8901 
        (a)(1):<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;None of the funds authorized in this chapter shall be used 
        to develop or distribute materials, or operate programs or courses of 
        instruction directed at youth that are designed to promote or encourage, 
        sexual activity, whether homosexual or heterosexual.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Congress (whom YOU elected) obviously thinks the Bill of Rights 
        is enough. Granted, Congress is not the most representative, but I propose 
        fixing what we have. Another new law won't do it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Gays do not have fewer rights. They do not have more rights. 
        Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the editorial is nothing more than uneducated 
        blather. "The 48 percent of Americans who voted for Bush, for example 
        are not necessarily evil or stupid," but most are right? Thinly veiled 
        attacks on the characters of those who don't agree with you don't get 
        you anywhere. "For the second time in recent years Mainers had the opportunity 
        to conclusively affirm a belief in basic human rights." So, the rest of 
        us that disagreed with the bill don't believe in basic human rights? That 
        would be 50.55 percent of the population that doesn't believe in basic 
        human rights? Did you read what you wrote?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And then we have the assertion that high income males are 
        against this bill and therefore against human rights. I am a high income 
        male. Am I against human rights because of this bill? Absolutely not! 
        Don't confuse statistics with causality.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I'll end this now. But let it be a lesson: just because I 
        believe that we have sufficient laws to cover an issue and that we don't 
        need more does NOT mean I am against an entire slew of basic issues. Remember: 
        All sweeping generalizations are bad.</p>
