      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your insightful editorial on Nader voters and 
        their role in the recent election. However, as one of those narrow minded, 
        misguided individuals who was silly and self-serving enough to cast my 
        vote for the "spoiler," I thought I might perhaps add my two cents.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let's be honest. Ralph Nader did not lose the 
        election for Al Gore. If (and it remains to be seen) George W. Bush will 
        be the next President of the United States, it is not because Nader swooped 
        in, siphoning off key Democratic votes. It is because Gore lost it for 
        himself. He has years of political experience, including two terms each 
        as Congressman, Senator, and Vice President. He is an intelligent, capable, 
        and experienced politician up against one of the worst possible Republican 
        candidates. An inept, inexperienced opponent with a notorious personal 
        history and a high school reading level, George W. Bush's record consists 
        only of several failed business ventures and two terms as Texas governor.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this race was even close is astonishing. I do 
        not feel that I should be obliged to sacrifice my political beliefs and 
        bail Gore out because he somehow allowed Bush to get ahead.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take issue with your assertion that a 
        vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. This assumes that Al Gore had some 
        sort of rightful claim to my vote; that Nader, as an illegitimate third-party 
        candidate, stole this vote from its rightful recipient. It is a very arrogant 
        view, which does not respect the fact that a vote for Nader really is 
        a vote for Nader. You see it simply as a vote for someone other than your 
        own candidate.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I did not abandon the Democratic Party; it abandoned me. Al 
        Gore and the majority of Democrats are simply not liberals. Being a progressive 
        means favoring some type of reform. Gore is not interested in changing 
        anything. He might pay lip-service to certain issues such as the homeless, 
        the environment, and education, but where are the traditional liberal 
        causes of social justice, poverty, or international workers rights? We 
        live in a society where Bill Gates has more money in securities than every 
        African-American in the nation combined, where more than 20 percent of 
        our country's children live in poverty, and where international corporations 
        exploit workers throughout the world.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The Democratic Party does not address these issues any longer. 
        Gore might be pro-choice, but please do not try to tell me that he is 
        a social or environmental reformer. Tell it to the U'wai.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Al Gore does not realize that there is more to being a progressive 
        than being pro-choice and putting social security in a "lock-box." If 
        he were the liberal crusader he claims to be, then there would be no need 
        for a Green Party or a Nader. I would have voted Gore in good conscience. 
        But he has jumped ship and taken a large part of the Democratic Party 
        with him. He has abandoned me and my vote. I am not an uncompromising 
        idealist. I am simply a progressive who voted for the only real liberal 
        who happened to be running this term.</p>
