      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Success. Nearly 140 minority students visited Bowdoin last 
        weekend and were welcomed by students, faculty, and staff. Several Bowdoin 
        students commented on how the sudden influx of minorities improved the 
        atmosphere on campus. Certainly, a walk across campus this past weekend 
        made it easy for one to feel that Bowdoin was doing a good thing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps students were comforted by the fact that, in welcoming 
        so many minority students to campus, Bowdoin appears less elite and more 
        open to positive change. However, despite admitting minority students 
        in an attempt to improve the racial and economic diversity at Bowdoin, 
        this college remains an elite institution. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Most students wish that Bowdoin would attract a more racially 
        and economically diverse population of students, and yet, many minority 
        students have no desire to attend Bowdoin. The facilities and opportunities 
        at Bowdoin are superb, but as many minority students commented when interviewed 
        by the Orient last year, subtle reminders of exclusion abound within the 
        Bowdoin community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Students probably do not intend to exclude students who are 
        racially or economically in the minority, but, nevertheless, it happens. 
        This past weekend, upon embarking on the group trip to Freeport, several 
        Bowdoin students told the prospective students to "bring their credit 
        cards, because they will want to buy everything." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While such a comment is spoken with no ill intent, the assumption 
        that most young adults have credit cards that they may use for shopping 
        sprees is insensitive and exclusionary. The students to whom this comment 
        was made responded with blank stares. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is true that some of the minority students visiting 
        this past weekend are not financially strapped, in America there remains 
        a strong correlation between race, gender, and economic status. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If students truly want Bowdoin to become a more diverse community, 
        they must be willing to challenge their assumptions and discuss topics 
        outside of their comfort zone. As author Audrey Lorde argues, it is not 
        the duty of the excluded to educate the majority. Rather, both groups 
        must have the desire to learn from each other so that the status quo can 
        be redefined. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;If many of the prospective minority students decide to attend 
        Bowdoin, the community has the potential to be altered in extraordinary 
        ways. Minority students cannot be thrown into the Bowdoin community and 
        be expected to conform, but rather, current students and new students 
        alike will have the challenge of defining the character of the Bowdoin 
        community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Such a challenge will be the most definitive and potentially 
        rewarding test of the effectiveness of a Bowdoin education. If we fail 
        this test, academic success within the classroom loses all external validity.
