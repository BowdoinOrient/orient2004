      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to tell you about 
        a spectacle of speed and power that will make you break into a frantic 
        sweat, make your heart race, and quite possibly send you reeling to the 
        ground drenched in your own tears of joy. I am going to tell you about 
        love, and the heights that the human spirit can ascend to. I am going 
        to tell you about the finest automotive machines ever crafted by human 
        hands. I’m going to tell you how I grew from boy into a man. And how I 
        grew from a man into a savage ape. And if all goes according to plan, 
        I’m going to give you a small taste of America’s greatest innovation: 
        unabated NASCAR racing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty-seven weekends a year, a band of warriors climb 
        into their iron chariots and risk their lives in pursuit of the Winston 
        Cup Championship. Are these mortal men, or are they Gods? Could there 
        be a world devoid of stock car racing? Would anybody in their right mind 
        choose to live in such a world? I think not. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you knew that a mere 130 miles west of Bowdoin 
        there exists a super speedway that attracts legions of crazed individuals 
        each weekend. Maybe you didn’t. The fact remains that in the tiny hamlet 
        of Loudon, New Hampshire, the Mecca known as the New Hampshire International 
        Speedway (NHIS) stands as a monument that draws the likes of kings, the 
        likes of paupers, the likes of race fans. I will speak earnestly with 
        you my friends, for I know of no other mode of operation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a warm fall weekend in early September I made a 
        journey to NHIS with six of my fellow comrades (seniors all of us, poised 
        to take on the new challenges of the Winston Cup as we had tackled and 
        overcome all that had met us in our illustrious Bowdoin careers) to watch 
        the Dura Lube 300. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men who eventually left that raceway were enlightened 
        beings who swam in exhilaration and touched the face of a new God. They 
        were also primal beasts, bereft of any semblance of integrity, ethical 
        action, or the basic abilities of maintaining an acceptable level of personal 
        hygiene. Beasts who stalked a prey of grilled meats, sparkling transmissions, 
        and motor oil. How did this all happen? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We began our journey in a 27-foot extravaganza know 
        as The California Flyer. As motor homes go this piece of machinery was 
        a gem. Inside, she provided every imaginable amenity one could expect 
        from a motor home; outside, her smooth, sexy shape cut through the New 
        Hampshire air like a the slingshot pellets I played with as a boy. She 
        was captained by William Golding, the man who had arranged for the rental 
        of the R.V. Golding directed us to a shopping megaplex in Concord N.H. 
        where we loaded up with all the necessities for the weekend...namely pounds 
        of uncooked meat, charcoal, potato chips, playing cards, and macro brews. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me say a word about beer consumption at a NASCAR 
        race. Leave your German Oatmeal Stouts, and Honey Dew Drop Raspberry Porters 
        at home. Race officials enforce a strict code that calls for the ejection 
        of any mongrel who isn’t drinking a beer that is light in body and slight 
        on taste. Also, every beverage must have a thick Styrofoam blanket surrounding 
        it known as a “Coo-Zee” to keep it freezing delicious. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The belly of The Flyer filled to its brim, we came 
        upon the gates of the speedway, and got in line to find our campsite. 
        The scene outside was delirious with activity. Husbands hoisted wives 
        up on their shoulders and danced to country music. Bonfires raged and 
        roared, that were barely in control. People slapped each other on the 
        back, high fived, and smoked cigarettes like it was the last day on earth. 
        And this was just at the entrance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we snaked our way through the grounds fighting the 
        traffic, members of the NASCAR cult would enter The Flyer from time to 
        time to give us the warmest of welcomes. Most of these people were men 
        named Randy who sported WWF t-shirts, gold chains, and serpent tattoos 
        on either arm. Finally the wait was over and our campsite loomed on the 
        horizon. It’s name was ominous and telling: The Jungle. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jungle is on the outskirts of the campground at 
        NHIS. It is where they put fans who crave lawless destruction and excess. 
        It is not a place for the politically correct or morally righteous. Along 
        the main roadway of the campground, a group of men yelled at the passing 
        vehicles to “Light ‘em up” (obviously meaning they wanted the drivers 
        to spin their tires at a high rate of speed) and encouraged women to remove 
        their shirts and bare their naked breasts. We had entered the den of the 
        angry white male. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because we were unable to fulfil either of these requests, 
        we parked our camper and disembarked timidly. Would we be swallowed by 
        this mass of testosterone and inappropriate remarks? What would our mothers 
        think?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily one of our troops called us into action. Wendell 
        Simonson III screamed, “We’re not any different. We’ve just got to connect 
        with these people! It’s like a tomato bush trying to grow in a corn field...it’s 
        not going to flower unless it reaches for the sun!” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine words Wendell, fine words my boy. In hours we 
        had met our neighbors and been accepted as part of the clan. One of my 
        friends, Christopher “Kitty” Hughes even got into a spirited game of horseshoes 
        that went well into the night, and only ended when his new friend Rocko 
        was struck in the jaw by an errant toss. We couldn’t believe our good 
        fortune. We, awkward college students from the suburbs were making nice 
        with the heartland of America. It was beautiful. Although I had to lay 
        down in The Flyer for a spell because of a digestive mishap I encountered 
        on my seventh hot dog, the party roared through the night. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man who piloted the camper next to us became one 
        of our closest pals. His name was Jim and he spoke in a broken dialect 
        peppered with F-bombs. He himself actually worked on a pit crew at a smaller 
        racetrack in New York, and educated us in on the ins and outs of racing. 
        Never have I met a man so full of good cheer and self depreciating humor. 
        On one occasion he even filled us in on how to tip over an occupied porta 
        potty. Although Jim was not the world’s most handsome man (he was missing 
        all but three teeth on his upper gum line), he certainly had a pipeline 
        to the heart of womankind. He demonstrated this to us first with a story 
        about his escapades with a certain striper from Providence, and then with 
        suggestive catcalls to several women who passed by. How they resisted 
        his advances is a mystery to this day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night ended with us going to a massive rock concert 
        sponsored by Winston. Above the stage, an awestriking banner screamed 
        “Welcome Home! Nobody leaves a stranger!” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On stage a massive man with a shaved head screamed 
        to the chorus of outrageous guitar rhythms. And at the end of every song, 
        he screamed at the assembled multitude “You Suck!!!”. The audience roared 
        in approval. We did suck! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The band wrapped up the night with its signature tune, 
        “If You Play Another Country Song I’m Gonna Have To Kick Your Ass” and 
        we all headed back to the campsite. We set our alarms extra early, allowing 
        us time to wake up, go for a jog, and collect recyclables around the campsite. 
        As we nestled into bed, into our Flyer, my friend Jack Glynn summed it 
        up perfectly, muttering “America Rules, Dude.” as he drifted off. We were 
        at the height of ecstasy, but already we were losing our powers of rational 
        thought. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we awoke on the morning of the race, our outlook 
        on the world had changed drastically. Samuel “Eye Wash Boy” Margolis tried 
        to sneak into the bathroom to take a shower. No such luck buster. He was 
        met with resistance by several members of our entourage who felt that 
        showering was for “sissies” or “softies.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No member of the Flyer team was going to embarrass 
        the rest of the group by sporting a freshly washed shock of hair, or smelling 
        clean and beautiful. Somebody gathered all the toothbrushes in the camper 
        and threw them in a pile outside; soon they were ablaze in a glorious 
        plume of orange destruction. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it was only 10:00 we huddled around the 
        grill and cooked strips of raw meat, drooling and grunting like demented 
        wolves, drunk with anticipation at the thought of tearing the prey into 
        unrecognizable pieces. Alexander “Keats” Ellis ran into a nearby wood 
        with a hunk of cooked animal meat. What happened there is between him 
        and the pair New Hampshire State Troopers who were forced to confront 
        the ghastly scene. For the rest of us, the hour of the race was approaching. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cornerstone of the NASCAR experience is grounded 
        in the fact that each race fan has one driver that they root for throughout 
        the season, throughout their lives, maybe even after death. For us, this 
        driver is a man named Ricky Rudd, a veteran of the circuit who is lauded 
        for his dignity and bravery on the track. Several times Rudd has been 
        flipped over on the track, - sent in a spiral of flames against the outer 
        embankment. Each time he has emerged even more determined and focused. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we walked to the gates of the facility we linked 
        arms with other devotees of the noble #28 car. Each member of the sect 
        was draped from head to toe in a wild array of Ricky Rudd paraphernalia...I’ll 
        tell you right now my friends that blanketing yourself in the race colors 
        of your favorite driver is indescribable. It is as close as I have come 
        to unabashed love; Rudd is not only a hero, he is a father figure to millions. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the track, we made our way to our seats, each 
        pair of eyes fixed on our beloved Rudd as he started his engine and began 
        to speed around the track. The race was underway. I can hardly recall 
        what happened in the next three hours. I guess the reason for this was 
        the intensity of the engines, and the fact that we had ascended to a place 
        where individual thought gave way to one collective mind that rose above 
        the speedway and contemplated all that was good and true.On one of many 
        trips to the restroom I spotted a middle-aged man sobbing next to the 
        snack bar. He was sporting a dizzying kaleidoscope of race gear supporting 
        Jeff Burton, the driver who eventually won the race. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The race was nearly over, and although Rudd appeared 
        to have secured a top ten finish, victory was not the name of the day. 
        I was somewhat disappointed, but still giddy about the enlightenment I 
        had obtained. Little did I know that upon my return to Bowdoin several 
        members of The Flyer contingent would be forced to take a leave of absence 
        from the college because of NASCAR related difficulties. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One member decided to stop going to the dining hall. 
        Instead he fed himself only from the animals that he was able to catch 
        and kill with his own hands. He became sick after ingesting rotten squirrel 
        meat. One member told his girlfriend that he had decided to stop speaking 
        English, and would instead communicate in a series of monkey-like grunts 
        and whistles. She ended the relationship. And in the most tragic case, 
        one member was unable to live outside the walls of NHIS. He decided he 
        was Ricky Rudd himself, and interrupted countless lectures with questions 
        about engine temperature and steering columns. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had gone too far. But despite our losses I will 
        remember for the rest of my days, what the man by the snack bar said to 
        me. Tears running down his face, beer belly trembling, thick black beard 
        dirtied with a bright orange sauce, he grabbed me by the forearm, looked 
        me in the eyes, and gasped, “These are the best damn nachos I’ve ever 
        had. God bless this place. God bless us all!!” </p>
