      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men’s cross-country season ended in disappointment 
        last Saturday at UMass-Dartmouth as they failed to qualify for the National 
        Championships to be contested this weekend in Spokane, Washington. The 
        top five New England teams earned all-expense-paid trips to Spokane, and 
        the Bears, who found themselves on the bottom of a tight 4 team pack competing 
        for two spots, were left out in the cold. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keene State won the race with 38 points, and was followed 
        closely by Williams (52), who raced to second behind the 3-4 finish of 
        Dusty Lopez and Tim Campbell. Tufts rounded out the top three, leaving 
        four teams and only two spots. Trinity (197) and Coast Guard (201) were 
        the final qualifiers, leaving MIT (208) and Bowdoin (214) disappointed 
        and frustrated. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I was disappointed,” said Steve Allison ‘01, whose 
        6th place finish was a bright spot for the Bears. However, the post-race 
        comments of Allison dealt primarily with his state of disappointment over 
        this season’s results, “The team was too flat before the race. I could 
        sense from everyone that they wanted it, but they put too much pressure 
        on themselves. We weren’t as carefree as we were at NESCACs.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison and his teammates were visibly frustrated by 
        their failure to qualify. They beat both Tufts and Trinity just two weeks 
        ago, and missing qualifying by a mere 14 points is a difficult pill to 
        swallow. However, the silver lining to this particularly dark and stormy 
        cloud is that commencement in May will be just another day for the Bowdoin 
        men. Not one of their runners will receive his diploma, leaving hope for 
        next year. “This team could be the best Bowdoin has ever seen,” said Allison, 
        “but we still have to prove ourselves, we can’t beat teams with potential, 
        we have to beat them before the race with long runs during the summer 
        and hard workouts. Potential is a beautiful thing, but it has to be worked 
        on; it doesn’t realize itself. We learned that this season.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The theme of learning from the loss was an important 
        one for Allison, in a season that was riddled with injuries and roller-coaster- 
        like ups and downs, all of which were carefully mitigated by NESCAC Coach-of-the 
        Year Peter Slovenski. Slovenski’s receipt of the award was, along with 
        Allison’s performance a bright spot for the Bears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allison, a tough critic of his usually outstanding 
        performances, added, “I didn’t step it up. I had beaten everybody except 
        Perez [Race winner Wilson Perez of Keene State] convincingly. I just had 
        a poor race. I fell down in the mud at the two-mile mark and went from 
        3rd to 12th in a matter of seconds. I blew my race right there and was 
        lucky to qualify.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn’t lucky that Allison qualified for Nationals, 
        and to most informed observers, it wasn’t a surprise either. However, 
        another bright spot for the Bears was the surprise performance of sophomore 
        Todd Forsgren. As the season has progressed, Forsgren, constantly running 
        with the weight of the dismal Cleveland Browns on his shoulders, has steadily 
        improved, becoming Allison’s right-hand man. Like Lenin and Trotsky, these 
        two have spread the word about Bowdoin Cross Country. In the NESCAC race 
        that Allison won, Forsgren was close behind in 7th. That proximity continued 
        at UMass-Dartmouth, with Forsgren placing a strong 18th, just 30 seconds 
        off Allison’s place. The race earned Todd a place in the National Championships. 
        “I’m very honored to be able to represent Bowdoin in Spokane this year. 
        I have been running head-to-head with a number of runners who have qualified 
        for nationals in the past. However, when I got to the finish line, I was 
        still a bit shocked that I had run as well as I had.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Bowdoin cross country season goes on, with Steve 
        Allison and Todd Forsgren packing their black and white jerseys and heading 
        on a cross-continental pilgrimage to the Pacific North West. Allison, 
        who placed 36th, last year, could be in the top ten if he has his A-game. 
        Forsgren, who surprised the pundits on a weekly basis, could be in the 
        running for the top 50, and even a dark horse for All-American honors, 
        which go to the top 35 finishers. </p>
