      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women’s cross country team completed their season 
        last Saturday at the NCAA New England regional meet hosted by UMASS Dartmouth. 
        Bowdoin finished in eighth place out of the 35 teams that competed. Bowdoin 
        defeated Trinity, Wesleyan, Bates and MIT, amongst others. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of particular note was first year Meredith Godreau’s 
        performance. Her completion of the course in 18:34, a personal best this 
        season, earned her 20th place overall and a spot to compete at nationals. 
        Other notable performances include Co-Captain, Jessica Gray ’01, who finished 
        36th amongst nearly 300 other runners. Libby Barney ’03 ran a person best 
        time of 19:06 for the season. Kala Hardacker ’04 and Bre-Ann McKenna ’03 
        ran strong races as well. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier in the season, the Bowdoin team ran to a seventh 
        place finish at NESCACs, defeating Colby, Trinity and Bates. Tufts, who 
        tied with Bowdoin for seventh, hosted the competition. The course itself 
        was a combination of woods and fields which gave the women an opportunity 
        to run fast times without the challenge of overbearing hills. Coach Slovenski 
        commented on the course, “I think the open and flat courses were good 
        for our team. We have some good 800 meter track runners, and this will 
        be better for them than hilly courses.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Godreau was the top finisher for Bowdoin, running the 
        5K in 19:49. Hardacker followed Goudrea, and Gray finished just one second 
        behind Hardacker. Barney, McKenna, Kate Waller ’02, Erin Lyman ’01, Jen 
        Staples ’01, and Annie Blair ’03 all ran competitive races as well. Overall 
        Goudreau finished 22nd in the competition, Hardacker 25th, Gray 26th and 
        Barney 41st.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McKenna has been an integral part of the team this 
        season, consistently running in the #5 position. “Bre’s summer training 
        and courage in the races have been a big part of our team’s improvement 
        this season. She passed two runners on the final straightaway to move 
        us from 8th place into the tie for 7th,” Slovenski remarked. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Co-captains Gray and Erin Lyman ’01 have also been 
        lead runners for the team. The two have been top runners and top scorers 
        in every race this season. Their talent and enthusiasm are an asset to 
        the team. Godreau and Hardacker have demonstrated their prowess, particularly 
        towards the end of the season after overcoming high school injuries. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two first years led the team at NESCACs and will 
        continue to be a dominant force in the distance events during indoor track 
        season. The team’s strong season was also a result of the efforts of Waller, 
        Jen Staples and Blair. These runners consistently ran competitive times 
        and finished amongst the top scorers for the team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, the women’s cross country Team ran a strong 
        season due to the depth of the talent of the team. The last runner for 
        Bowdoin generally finished the race within 20-30 seconds of our lead runner. 
        It was this depth that enabled the women to race together effectively 
        and push one another to personal best performances. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The season will officially end after nationals. This 
        race will be held on November18 in Spokane, Washington. Good luck Meredith 
        and good job Bears on a strong cross country season. </p>
