      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin’s varsity swimmers began their season two Wednesdays 
        ago at 6:30 a.m. For the first time in 40 years, the Polar Bears will 
        not be swimming for the legendary Charlie Butt. This summer, the athletic 
        department hired Brad Burnham for the swim team’s new head coach. Burnham 
        comes to Bowdoin from a six-year assistant coaching position for the UCLA 
        women’s team. As quoted on the sports info site, Jeff Ward states: “We 
        are fortunate to have a teacher and coach of Brad’s quality running our 
        men’s and women’s swimming programs. He has worked with some of the finest 
        swimmers in the country and I expect him to create a great swimming atmosphere 
        here at Bowdoin.” Also joining the new coaching staff as assistant coach 
        is Mark Glauth, a champion cyclist (4-time Tour de France participant) 
        and knowledgeable stroke technician. With new faces on deck, the team 
        is ready for this upcoming meet season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s begin with the women’s team. They were 4-5 last 
        season and placed 7th out of 31 teams at the New England Championships. 
        The lady bears lost some key members of the team to graduation, including 
        backstroker Leigh Hoenig, medley swimmer and sprinter Kelsey Abbott, and 
        top point scorer Julie Bard. Most of the junior women are overseas this 
        semester but will return for championship season in January. Among them 
        are sprinter and breastroker Elizabeth “The BUELL” Buell, butterfliers 
        Audrey Gray and Alyson Friedlander, breastroker Ali Quade and backstroker 
        Melissa Tansey. Luckily, the women’s team has a strong nucleus of returning 
        swimmers. Catherine “Destroyer” Williams ’01 and Erin “The Rocket” Veenker 
        ’01 lead as the team captains, and are members of Team Backstroke and 
        Team Distance, respectively. Seniors Jenny “Phoenix” Mendelson and Meghan 
        “The Rock” Gregory contribute strongly to Team Sprint and middle distance. 
        Senior freestyler Jane “Paris” Roberts returns after a year in France. 
        Sarah “Puck” Hoenig ’02 and Jenn “Jacked” Laraia ’03 fight the field in 
        the breastroke events, and Annie “Distance” Blair ’03 joins Veenker in 
        the distance events. Three sophomore members of team sprint, Kara “Pokey” 
        Podkaminer ’03, Lauren “Hot Damn” McNally ’03, and Anna “The Predator” 
        Podore ’03 join Mendelson, while McNally also shares her meet time with 
        the backstroke events. Other strong sophomores are breastroker Allison 
        “the Beast” Benton, distance freestyler Allie “Hinner” Hinman, and backstroker 
        Meredith “Lethal” Hoar. A strong group of first year students rounds out 
        the women’s team. Kiele Mauricio brings incredible talent in all events, 
        particularly the butterfly and medley. Becky “Yellowjacket” Grossman, 
        Gillian “Agent Scully” Stevens, Katherine “the Rugger” Barnes, Alex “west 
        coast” de Rubira, Mary Melnik, Jen “Montevideo” Montalvo, Jenny Scangos, 
        Emily Scott, and Cara Tow create frosh team sprint for Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men’s team finished last season with a record of 
        3-7, finishing 12th out of 24 teams at the New England Championships. 
        The men are in an unusual situation, as they have no senior captains this 
        year. Junior sprinter Elliot “Superman” Dickson and distance freestyler/backstroker 
        Andy “Euclid” Shaw fill the position of co-captains. Returning members 
        of the team core are backstroker and freestyler Matt “Rastaman” Hammond 
        ’02, Nick “Diesel” Driskill ’02, butterflier Robie “the Phish 1” Anson, 
        sprinters Dave “Skippy” Harden ’03, Will “Monty Python” Thomas ’03, Josh 
        “Kingston” Kingsbury ‘03 and Todd “Oregon” Williams ’04, and team distance, 
        John “Cliffo” Clifford and Matt “Iceman” Byrne. Seniors Henry Bangert 
        and Dan “Yummy” Farnbach add depth to the men’s team in freestyle and 
        breastroke, respectively. Freshman Mike “the Phish 2” Long will be a top 
        point scorer this season in the sprint freestyle and butterfly. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin also teams some fantastic divers up with the 
        swim team. Returning divers are sophomore Megan Lim and All-American diver 
        Maureen Singer ’01. Freshmen Emily Howe, Brian McGregor, and Darryl Bernstein 
        all show tremendous talent. McGregor and Bernstein are the first divers 
        to compete with the men’s team in two years. “Thanks to the svelte new 
        divers, Bernstein and McGregor, we have the opportunity to pick up some 
        extra points against some old rivals” states men’s team co-captain Andy 
        Shaw ’02. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We’re going into this season completely blind”, states 
        Head Coach Brad Burnham, “because there are so many athletes here who 
        don’t know their limits. They don’t know how fast they can go. That opens 
        up a lot of possibilities for us as coaches, because everyone is open 
        to our new concepts of technique and training.” How about strengths and 
        weaknesses? “I think one of the greatest strengths the team possesses 
        as a whole is their intelligence-they’re willing to learn; they learn 
        more quickly than any other group I’ve ever worked with.” Assistant coach 
        Mark Glauth adds, “We have remarkable leadership on this team. People 
        are great about getting on task and focusing right away. They’re learning 
        that there are more ways of measuring their success other than winning 
        a race.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the captains also had a word or two to say 
        about the season and the new coaches. “Although it was hard to let Coach 
        Charlie Butt go, Bowdoin could not have asked for two better coaches than 
        Brad and Mark. Their hard work, long hours, and willingness to help us 
        achieve our goals make swimming more fun.” states captain Elliot Dickson 
        ’02. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bowdoin swimmers will have their first regular-season 
        test this weekend against at MIT (Babson will be there as well). “I am 
        really looking forward to seeing how the team does against Babson and 
        MIT. The real competition is from Babson. We will be looking to go in 
        hard and stick it to the Beavers right from the start” an eloquent Dickson 
        reports. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all the evidence at hand, it is clear that the 
        team is superb. </p>
