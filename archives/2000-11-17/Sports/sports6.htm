      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the final record of 5-1, the Bowdoin Women’s Rugby 
        team couldn’t be happier at the close of this season. With a strong win 
        against Northeastern, the lady ruggers finished the season with the power 
        and confidence they displayed this entire year. Bowdoin ruggers showed 
        talent as well as class as they ignored negative attitudes from Northeastern 
        players on the field. The 36-10 victory is an example of the ability, 
        skill and potential this team reached at the end of the season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks ago, the women lost a crucial game to Wellesey 
        (52-7). The biggest matchup of the season, the ruggers prepared thoroughly 
        for the game. However, despite the effort and aggression displayed on 
        the field, the ruggers could not defeat Wellesey. With this one loss, 
        Bowdoin ended up placing fourth overall in division 2 of NERFU (New England 
        Rugby Football Union). Coaches and teammates alike found the challenge 
        of the match motivation to work and improve for next season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highly encouraging for the lady ruggers was the incredible 
        B-side pack which won a majority of their games. Many first-years displayed 
        determination and strength in their matches, and by the end of the season 
        a real improvement by the new players working together as a team was visible. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophomore Elie Doig said of the rookie players, “As 
        far as the season goes, I don’t think it could’ve gone better. To go from 
        0-5 last year to 5-1 this season is great, but that doesn’t even show 
        how incredibly strong this team is and continues to become. We’ve had 
        so many new people join who have become some of the most enthusiastic 
        members of the team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So many rookies picked up the game like they had 
        been playing it for years, too! I think that’s a major strength of the 
        team-the fact that so many people learned so much about rugby this season, 
        which was obvious in watching any of the games. With the enthusiasm of 
        this team, the wonderful coaching that we are lucky enough to have, and 
        the incredible sense of togetherness that exists between us, there is 
        no doubt that we will continue to learn and strengthen as a team.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strength of the rookie players was a direct result 
        of a team of skilled and supportive upperclassmen, ready and willing to 
        share their knowledge about the game to the new players. First-year, Eileen 
        Sock put it this way, “As a rookie, we could not have had better athletic 
        and personal role models than the upper class rugby players. Seniors and 
        playes going abroad will be sorely missed, but their tremendous leadership 
        this season has made a mark that we can live up to in the future.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bowdoin Rugby players are not gone for the rest 
        of the year, however, they look forward to more practice, improvement, 
        and playing in the spring season, with a possible tour to Europe as well.</p>
