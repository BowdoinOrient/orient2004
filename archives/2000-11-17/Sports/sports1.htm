      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin football squad ended their winless season 
        last Saturday in Waterville, Maine as the Colby Mules (7-1) bested the 
        Polar Bears 34-7 before a crowd of 1500. The win also gave the CBB Championship 
        to the Mules as they proved their supremacy over Bates and Bowdoin this 
        season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowdoin linebacker, Sean Lannigan ‘01, sparked his 
        team early in the first quarter. He intercepted a Pat Conley pass and 
        ran it back 55 yards for a Polar Bear touchdown and a 7-0 lead.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the momentum quickly turned as Colby rattled 
        off 34 unanswered points. With 5:58 left in the first, Conley connected 
        with Don Williams for a 5-yard TD pass to tie up the contest. Rashad Lewis 
        upped the lead as he ripped through the Polar Bears’ defense for a 22-yard 
        touchdown. Colby then connected on a field goal with only 46 seconds left 
        in the half for a 17-7 lead.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second half belonged to the Mules as well. Kicker 
        Keith Jonassen split the upright from 37 yards and RB Danny Noyes rushed 
        for two scores to hand Bowdoin its eighth loss of the season by a score 
        of 34-7. The Mules dominated statistically the game as they tallied 26 
        first-downs compared to only eight for Bowdoin. Colby also won the time 
        of possession battle by 15 minutes and amassed 179 yards rushing and 261 
        yards passing. Conversely, Bowdoin gained 62 net yards on the ground and 
        57 through the air. Co-captain Tim Lawson ‘01 finished his Bowdoin career 
        with 41 yards on 11 carries. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mike Taylor ‘02 carried the bulk of the load, running 
        for 48 yards on 13 carries. Before the season started, head coach Dave 
        Caputi talked about building upon “small victories” in order for his team 
        to be successful, but did not quantify the Polar Bears goals with respect 
        to wins and losses. Upon reflection, Caputi remarked, “I think we had 
        a lot of those little victories early on, but as the season progressed, 
        we were beat up with injuries and lost some of that continuity.” However, 
        the Polar Bear football team featured many young players who played significant 
        minutes and received valuable experience. Youngsters who contributed considerably 
        include tailback Kevin Bougie ‘04, quarterback Justin Hardison ‘03, wideout 
        Jason Rawlins ‘03, as well as others.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Offensively, we were able to play a lot of young kids 
        even though some of them may have been a little over their heads. They 
        lacked the physical maturity as freshman or sophomores that other kids 
        who have been in the weight room for three years already have. But, they 
        got a taste of what they need to do on the field and in the off-season,” 
        said Caputi. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caputi’s young offensive unit averaged 10.1 points 
        per game while their opponents tallied an average of 29.4. The Polar Bears 
        were also heavily out-rushed throughout the season. Bowdoin’s backfield 
        rushed for 716 yards and seven TDs with an average of 2.5 yards per carry, 
        but the Polar Bear’s opposition totaled a whopping 1659 yards on the ground 
        with a 4.3 yards per carry average and 17 TDs. Tim Lawson ‘01 led the 
        Polar Bear’s rushing attack and gained 304 yards on 71 carries while punching 
        it into the end zone four times. Bougie was the team’s second leading 
        rusher, and used 62 carries to gain 200 yards and score a TD. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Bowdoin fell short of their opponents on the 
        ground, Hardison and backup, Kyle Quinn ’01, combined to throw for more 
        yards than their opponents by a total of 1108 yards to 1000. However, 
        the Polar Bears only passed for two scores while their opponents threw 
        for 12 TDs. In his first year as a starter, Hardison completed 118 out 
        of 217 passes for 1046 yards and two TDs, but also was picked off nine 
        times. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hardison’s favorite target was Jason Rawlins ‘03 who 
        caught 29 passes for 312 yards and two TDs. Fellow wideout, Mike Taylor 
        ‘02, pulled in 25 passes for 166 yards and was second in the team in all-purpose 
        yards averaging 44.1 yards per game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the defensive side of the football will be 
        losing many valuable senior contributors. Senior DB Brian Losier led the 
        Polar Bears in tackles with 67 including seven that went for losses. Nick 
        Krol ‘01 made 61 tackles from the linebacker position while his fellow 
        linebacker and co-captain Tom Connelly ‘01 made 47 tackles and had two 
        sacks. Linebacker Sean Lannigan ‘01 made 50 tackles, including 13 tackles 
        for a loss and three sacks. Another senior defensive stalwart, Shaun Leonardo 
        ‘01, tallied 53 tackles throughout the year and had two sacks. However, 
        Travis Cummings ‘02 will return next year after making 60 tackles this 
        season and intercepting four passes for 112 yards. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite losing a fair number of senior defensive players, 
        Caputi and the Polar Bears remain optimistic for next season due to the 
        number of returning players on the offensive side of the ball and the 
        work they plan to put in during the off season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coaching staff has also been vying for talented 
        recruits in the off season. Said Caputi, “We are working hard in the recruiting 
        aspect. The coaches have attended over 20 different camps and a lot of 
        players have visited campus. The main thing is that we have let the College 
        sell itself and show the recruits the opportunities they have in the Bowdoin 
        football program.” </p>
