      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinkity-clink. The unmistakable jingle of copper and 
        silver created a slight, yet undeniable drone on our fair campus last 
        Friday. Across the quad, through hallways, in the classroom, the clinking 
        came from every khaki-pants pocket on its way to Smith Union. In the Union, 
        the slight clinking became a roaring waterfall of change at the Up ‘til 
        Dawn table, the epicenter of the Penny Wars competition. Add to this flow 
        of coins the sweet aroma of a good, old-fashioned bakesale, and you’ve 
        got yourself one heck of a fundraiser. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penny Wars provided an excellent forum for students 
        to act upon their affinity or seething hatred toward any particular social 
        house. The penny jars elicited such a response that extra buckets had 
        to be put out to hold the swelling collections. A palpable tension hung 
        in the air as students anxiously wondered whether their pennies would 
        truly make a difference. Earlier exit polls had shown the contest was 
        to be a tight one, but no one was prepared for the mayhem that would ensue 
        during the counting process.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After finally ending the collection period, the Up 
        ‘til Dawn team began the laborious counting process. Chief Counting Officer 
        Erica Bellamy ’03 had confidence in a rapid, accurate count and said, 
        “We’re going to stick to the basics: pennies are one cent, nickels are 
        five, dimes ten, and quarters twenty-five. Nothing fuzzy about that math.” 
        Alas, predictions have an uncanny ability to turn out false. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems arose as long nights of coin-counting began 
        to take their toll on the counters. “My fingers hurt,” whined Assistant 
        Nickel Director Alex Duncan ‘03. Working in shifts, counters alternated 
        from feverishly sorting and counting to resting and icing their weary 
        fingers. Speculation surfaced, suggesting that these weakened fingers 
        may have compromised the accuracy of the counters. Nonetheless, the selfless 
        counters forged on, jar after jar. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problems continued with reports of irate students, 
        who contended that the jar layout was too confusing to be followed. Said 
        potentially disenfranchised donor Ryan Q. ‘03, “I set out to put my pennies 
        in the Boody Street jar, which I believe is a very strong house. Afterward, 
        I was dismayed to find I had dropped them in Pat Buchanan’s jar!” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the interviewer pointed out that there was no 
        jar for Pat Buchanan, Ryan quickly changed the subject and eventually 
        ran away, throwing doubt on the legitimacy of his accusations. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the controversy, the Up ‘til Dawn counting 
        committee declined to declare a winner, and launched an extensive hand 
        recount. They hope to be finished with the count by next week.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Penny Wars generated much debate, everyone 
        agreed the bakesale was a true winner, raising an estimated $175. Brownies, 
        cookies, cheesecake, and pies dazzled the eye and thrilled the tongue. 
        While each dish was a marvel in baking achievement, the blue ribbon went 
        to Kara Podkaminer ‘03 who knocked the secret panel of judges for a loop 
        with her chocolate pecan pie.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It was like a culinary alley-oop,” an unnamed judge 
        reported. “The pecans lobbed my tongue up, and then the chocolate slammed 
        it down. I’m not afraid to say it hit the spot.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Up ‘til Dawn team reminds students that all proceeds 
        from Penny Wars and the bakesale go toward St. Jude’s Children’s Research 
        Hospital, which performs vital research on childhood illnesses. The team 
        also encourages all to look for other Up ‘til Dawn fundraisers throughout 
        the year. </p>
