      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON-Readers with a good memory and nothing better 
        to fill it with will recall that several weeks ago I spent a week and 
        a half not in London but in Italy. Well, I’m back, with a tan (barely) 
        and a newfound appreciation for really small motorized vehicles.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scooters of any shape or form are cause for public 
        humiliation in America. (I’m not talking about the Sharper Image, retro-style 
        scooter here-which should be embarrassing to use-but “scooter” in the 
        sense of an underfunded motorcycle.) Lincoln Navigators have no patience 
        for mosquito-like scooters zipping in and out of lanes. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In London, scooters are a little more accepted, but 
        bonafide motorcycles are more popular, and the climate is a strong argument 
        for a vehicle with a roof. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Smart car-designed in part by Swatch-is a good 
        compromise here. It’s eight feet long, skinnier than a normal car, has 
        two seats, and looks like an iMac on wheels. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Italians, however, prefer scooters. There are easily 
        as many of them in Rome as there are cars (and, incidentally, good luck 
        finding any cars bigger than a Ford Taurus). They run around everywhere. 
        You see all kinds-Vespas that must have been on sale when Mussolini was 
        in power, cute little pink Hondas and dangerous-looking BMWs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, traffic is pretty patient in dealing with 
        scooters, in a way that Americans would find hard to accept. Lanes in 
        the States are treated like electrically charged barriers; changing lanes 
        is a big deal, and new drivers are told to plan lane changes blocks in 
        advance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all over Europe, and especially in Italy, traffic 
        lanes are mere suggestions, and often ignored. Scooters are great at this! 
        A traffic jam, to an Italian on a scooter, is not a barrier but an intriguing 
        obstacle course. Sidewalks are not out of bounds in this situation. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In spite of this, Italy was a more relaxing place to 
        be a pedestrian than London. Rome is certainly less dense, in terms of 
        buildings and people. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are almost no public advertisements anywhere 
        in Rome, Florence, or Venice-no billboards, no ads draping over the sides 
        of buildings, few advertisements on taxis or buses.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one stands on the street corner shoving flyers into 
        your torso; fewer newsstands have signs saying “COPS NAB NUN IN TOT STAB,” 
        “BLAIR CALLS BECKS NINCOMPOOP” or something similarly controversial and 
        confusing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Italy runs at a slower pace because its public 
        spaces have less offensive and annoying stuff to hurry away from than 
        in London. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did eat well in Italy. No surprise there. The pizzas 
        are almost impossibly thin, practically on saltine-size crusts, but usually 
        tasty. I recommend eggplant. One of us, Paul, made it a point to eat at 
        least one pizza a day, at lunch or dinner. Meals were lavish: the four 
        of us usually spent over-gasp-100,000 lire! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’d have to be a millionaire in Italy to be anywhere 
        over the poverty line! True-and a dollar equals about 2,000 lire. I think. 
        Anyway it’s some ridiculous exchange rate like that. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our days in Rome was devoted to Pompeii. We 
        took the train (Italy, like most European countries, has a large and cheap 
        rail network) to Naples and looked around the train station for a bus 
        to Pompeii. I went off to the change bureau for a couple hundred thou 
        and came back to find Dave, Chase, and Paul standing next to an old Italian 
        guy straight out of <i>The Godfather</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mario, who had a business card and a Mercedes, was 
        offering to be our personal chauffeur for the day-to Pompeii and back-for 
        about 20 bucks each. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, why not? And it turned out great. It was definitely 
        not the first time Mario had encountered American tourists en route to 
        Pompeii. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the highway we got a running commentary-“Vesuvius 
        there. Other mountain next to Vesuvius there.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once at Pompeii, we parked next to a café across the 
        street. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mario said, in effect, see you later-I’ll be here. 
        He settled down with his friends, cracked a bottle of wine, and smiled. 
        So we went in and saw Pompeii, came out almost four hours later, and Mario 
        was still there. Thoughtfully he had reserved us a table at the café for 
        lunch. I think his aunt ran the place. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We asked him to drop us off at a museum in Naples, 
        on the other side of town than the train station, and he did, advising 
        us to “take the subway back.” Subway? Naples is maybe half the size of 
        Portland; what does it need a subway for? He must mean a trolley or something.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, in fact, Naples has a subway system. Two lines; 
        maybe 15 stops. It is definitely a more relaxed system than London’s Tube. 
        Tickets are sold but unnecessary, since there aren’t any turnstiles to 
        jump; the honor system is augmented by infrequent, random ticket checks 
        on the trains, but we never saw anyone do this. Getting lost would be 
        hard, since there’s only one platform to go to. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Italian commitment to public transportation reaches 
        its apex, however, in Venice. This city doesn’t even have roads, and half 
        of it is underwater. No subway here. Once again, the train station was 
        far from where our hotel was, and even by Italian price standards a water 
        taxi would be expensive. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution: a floating subway system. Pubic boats 
        run on about ten different lines all over Venice’s main islands. Tickets 
        are cheap, the honor system remains in place, and one line even runs all 
        night-which you can’t say for the Tube. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I think the Bowdoin area would benefit from an underground 
        transportation system. It would ease the parking problems and make a shuttle 
        unnecessary. Put one stop in the middle of the quad; another out by the 
        athletic fields; another by Shop ‘n’ Save; and one satellite station next 
        to Wal-Mart. Have it run by computer 24 hours a day, and just for the 
        heck of it, make it free. What’s an endowment for, anyway? </p>
