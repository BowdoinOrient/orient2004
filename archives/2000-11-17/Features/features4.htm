      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON-Prompted by recent events, not on the collegiate 
        but the electoral college front, we will today fast-forward this series 
        to the author’s second year Beneath the Pines, 1956-1957. On the First 
        Tuesday in November (see title of previous installment) of 1956, that 
        year’s Presidential election took place. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contenders were Adlai E. Stevenson, Democrat, the 
        unsuccessful candidate for president four years prior, and Republican 
        Dwight D. Eisenhower, the incumbent President. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though it was the common consent that the loser 
        of 1952 didn’t stand a chance against a popular president in 1956, I became 
        an ardent Stevenson fan. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was partly due to a general political re-orientation 
        as I grew older-in line with Churchill’s famous saying, that if you’re 
        not a conservative at twenty, you’ve got no brains, and if not a liberal 
        at thirty, no heart. But it was also partly to the more liberal outlook 
        of some of the friends that I made in my second year at Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief among these was my off-campus roommate Edward 
        Podvoll, a New York doctor’s son, with whom I shared rooms on the top 
        floor of an old clapboard house on Union Street, whose landlady appropriately 
        enough was a Mrs. Lincoln.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed had the large room in front, I a smaller one in 
        back, with a sloping ceiling and a dormer window, from which I could see 
        “Jancy,” the Wylis jeep I’d inherited from Big Brother Bill that was parked 
        down below. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill, who was married by now and living with his wife 
        Nancy in married quarters, was driving himself and her around in a brand-new 
        Mercedes 200 that his adoptive mother, old Nellie (see Most Unforgettable 
        Character September 29,2000), had given them as a belated wedding present, 
        after first having me, the Best Man, chauffeur her around Europe in it. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Picking it up for her at the factory in Sindelfingen 
        near Stuttgart made me feel a bit like an impostor, for in those days, 
        though it was only a medium-sized model, it was the sort of car Captains 
        of Industry, busily creating Germany’s post-war Economic Miracle, were 
        seen to be driving. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so nervous it was a wonder I didn’t wreck it 
        before picking up its owner who was flying in from L.A., at Frankfurt 
        Airport. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed had no car and was a bit envious, I think. But he 
        had a great collection of classical LP’s he let me listen to, and lots 
        of books he let me borrow, or liked to talk to me about. Two of his favorite 
        authors were Erich Fromm and Reinhold Niebuhr, both sixties intellectual 
        icons. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also liked Martin Buber, the great Jewish religious 
        philosopher, and was amazed to hear that my grandfather, a writer on literary 
        and philosophical subjects, had been a friend of Buber.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed also was very fond of poetry, particularly that 
        of T.S. Eliot, some of which he knew by heart. Among his favorite lines, 
        from Prufrock, were: Do I dare eat a peach/Roll up my trousers on the 
        beach, mock-seriously recited by Ed in the sonorous tones of the author 
        himself, reading from his works on a recording. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of his favorite pieces of music, Caesar Franck’s 
        D-Minor Symphony, new to me, weaned on Beethoven. We would sit up until 
        late listening to music, or talking about everything under the sun, except 
        one thing- the Holocaust, as it was not yet called, which was, in those 
        days, a taboo subject still, at least between Jews and Germans.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not surprisingly, being a bit of an “egg head,” Ed 
        too was a Stevenson fan, and, like myself, was fervently hoping Adlai 
        would, this time around, beat Ike, a president he said who read nothing 
        but The Reader’s Digest, and felt more at home on the golf course than 
        in the Oval Office. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhow, the fact that Stevenson didn’t really stand 
        a chance was lost on me, a hapless victim of my own wishful thinking. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was totally ignorant of how American politics 
        really worked, namely in maddening conformity with what Henry Adams (already 
        quoted) called “the shifting sands of American public opinion,” of which 
        we have had such a good demonstration only recently. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So naively confident was I that Stevenson would win, 
        I started betting on the outcome, one dollar, with anyone willing to take 
        me on. This must have been, in view of polls predicting another Republican 
        landslide, almost the whole fraternity. Fortunately, when the time came 
        to collect their debts, most decided to let me off the hook by pretending 
        it had all been a joke. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This taught me a great lesson, and I have never bet 
        on anything since, except once, quite recently, on the result of the European 
        soccer cup final, France vs. Italy, which I correctly predicted France 
        would win. (However, the winning goal wasn’t scored until extra time, 
        for which eventuality I wasn’t covered. That taught me another lesson: 
        read the fine print.) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naturally, I was devastated when Stevenson lost.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having stayed up all night with Ed, listening to the 
        results and commentaries on the radio, I suggested, when dawn broke, that 
        we take “Jancy” and drive to the nearest beach to take a long walk. It 
        was rather chilly of course, and though we would certainly have dared, 
        we didn’t roll up our trousers, nor did we eat a peach, as we hadn’t gotten 
        any. We didn’t talk much either-just walked in silence, with a strong 
        wind off the ocean in our tired faces, blowing mental cobwebs away, and 
        helping ameliorate post-electoral blues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the while something kept going through my mind 
        that Stevenson, after conceding, had said to a reporter. Asked how he 
        felt after losing a second time, Adlai, in typical fashion, had quipped, 
        “like a little boy who’s stubbed his toe in the dark, but is too old to 
        cry.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was exactly how we felt, and as millions will 
        feel-unless a miracle happens-this year when the recount in Florida is 
        finally announced to a world no longer holding its breath, but wondering 
        if American democracy isn’t in danger of sinking in the “shifting sands 
        of public opinion,” along with its archaic election laws and dubious vote-counting 
        procedures, as in a quicksand. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you read this we may at least have a correct 
        figure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or not the damage done to the electoral 
        process by all this confusion, inefficiency, and the sheer injustice of 
        having invalidated on technical grounds thousands of votes cast in good 
        faith in an election this close can ever be repaired is another question. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, next week, back to the fifties: twentieth-century 
        America’s Golden Age in comparison with the present one, unprecedentedly 
        prosperous, yet so uncertain. </p>
