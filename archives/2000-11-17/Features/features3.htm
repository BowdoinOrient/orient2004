      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a time of gloom for both the United States and 
        the Confederate States. June 1863 saw the desperation of the Confederacy 
        and the frustration of the Union. On the western front, Ulysses S. Grant 
        clung on to the river town of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and all through 
        the South, the death of Stonewall Jackson, a month earlier, was still 
        being mourned.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the North, recent disasters on the eastern front 
        were not greeted well. Anxiously, the Lincoln Administration pushed for 
        something to be done about the seemingly invincible rebel Army of Northern 
        Virginia under Robert E. Lee. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Union Army of the Potomac commander General Joseph 
        Hooker, opposing Lee, had seen his splendid plan to crush Lee fail in 
        the tangled mess of the Wilderness at the beginning of May and now seemed 
        not to have a clue as to what to do next. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Hooker’s reputation suffered from the disastrous 
        Battle of Chancellorsville, his subordinate, Oliver Howard, Commander 
        of the Federal Eleventh Corps suffered even more. His reputation had been 
        crushed by Jackson’s surprise flank attack. His corps, comprised mostly 
        of German units, also lost their already sketchy standing in the army 
        ranks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Howard was never censured and no charges were 
        ever pressed. There was room for forgiveness. There was also room for 
        making up for his mistakes, and Howard intended to prove his fighting 
        skill once and for all. He would soon get his chance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June, Robert E. Lee marched with his rebel army 
        around the right flank of the Army of the Potomac to begin his second 
        invasion of the north. He hoped to move fast enough so that his presence 
        on enemy soil could scare the Lincoln Administration to beg for peace. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late in June, the Army of the Potomac marched from 
        its camp on the Rappahannock River to pursue. Massive controversy over 
        authority caused Hooker to be replaced with Major General George G. Meade. 
        Meanwhile, elements of the Union Army were entering Pennsylvania in pursuit 
        of Lee’s scattered commands. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the crossroads town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 
        Union General John Buford’s cavalry division ran into elements of Confederate 
        General Henry Heth’s infantry division. Heth had sent his men into Gettysburg, 
        not for a fight, but to acquire some much-needed shoes. It was June 30. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Howard was dining with his wing commander, 
        Major General John F. Reynolds, at a farmhouse between Gettysburg and 
        the town of Emmitsburg. Earlier that month, as the Federal troops began 
        to cross back onto northern soil, Howard had received a letter from Maine, 
        asking him if he would accept a nomination to run for governor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howard had never entered politics, and undoubtedly 
        he felt that he had a score to settle with the rebels under Lee. Despite 
        urges from loyal supporters, Howard turned down the offer and focussed 
        on reclaiming his corps’s tarnished name. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Howard and Reynolds awaited new orders 
        from Meade. Nothing came, and Reynolds left. It was the last time Howard 
        would see Reynolds again. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of July 1, 1863, General Heth’s division 
        advanced down the Chambersburg Pike towards Gettysburg, intending to brush 
        aside resistance, which Heth concluded, was militia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Buford’s cavalrymen gave the rebels a rough handling 
        and the infantry ran back to Heth, confused and dazed. Again the rebels 
        came, and Buford sent word to John Reynolds that he needed support or 
        he could not hold. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reynolds, one of the best commanders the North had, 
        soon arrived on the field and summoned the three corps under his command 
        to move on Gettysburg. His troops were the superb First Corps, Howard’s 
        Eleventh Corps, and Dan Sickle’s Third Corps. His first division under 
        General James Wadsworth came into line. The troops were the famed Iron 
        Brigade. The “Black Hats”-they were referred to in this name thanks to 
        the black felt hats that became their symbol during the War-struck Heth’s 
        tired troops and sent them running. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But more Confederate troops were moving in. By now, 
        Lee had seen the danger of his exposed command and ordered a concentration 
        at Gettysburg. General Richard Ewell’s Second Corps was to enter the crossroads 
        town from the north while General A. P. Hill’s Third Corps was to hammer 
        its way in from the West. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hill, Heth’s corps commander, ordered his entire command 
        forward, and soon the Federal troops had their hands full. It was during 
        this morning action that General Reynolds lost his life. He was struck 
        by a sniper’s bullet. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Command of the field was suddenly passed to Howard, 
        as the senior major general on the field. Howard, no doubt stunned by 
        the sudden expansion of his responsibilities, told the First Corps to 
        hold the northwest section of Gettysburg while his own men went into position 
        towards the north of town. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howard placed his corps under General Carl Schurz, 
        and ordered one division, under General Adolph von Steinwehr, to hold 
        Cemetery Hill, a natural place of considerable strength to the south of 
        Gettysburg. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other two divisions under Schurz were hurried towards 
        the north to receive an attack from General Richard Ewell’s rebel command. 
        Howard remained on Cemetery Hill, watching the afternoon action, and further 
        ordering the placement of Union cannon on the Hill. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fighting became intense. The First Corps held beautifully 
        against A.P. Hill’s savage assaults to the west, despite heavy losses. 
        To the north, Howard’s line was not doing so well. Struck hard by reinforced 
        Confederate divisions, the Federal troopers broke and ran for the protection 
        of their guns south of town.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overwhelming numbers had routed the Germans and many 
        of them got lost in the streets of Gettysburg, to be captured later when 
        the rebels entered the town. One Union general, Alexander Schimmelfennig, 
        hid in a pigpen during the next three days, which were to mark the heaviest 
        fighting on the North American continent. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the rout of the Eleventh Corps, the First Corps 
        could no longer maintain its position and also fell back to Cemetery Hill 
        where Howard tried to rally the men from both corps. It was the timely 
        arrival of Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a much loved commander, 
        that saved the day. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hancock’s presence on the field stemmed the tide of 
        retreat but also upset Howard, who outranked the newly arrived general. 
        Hancock had orders from General Meade to take command of the field, but 
        Howard felt that he was being undermined. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether Howard’s actions helped anything on the first 
        day of Gettysburg is still a matter of controversy. The command of the 
        Federal wing was suddenly thrust upon him after Reynolds’s death. Howard 
        may have intended to fight a holding action, as Reynolds had, while awaiting 
        the reinforcements from Meade. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was, however, overwhelmed by numbers and determination. 
        His poor showing at Chancellorsville may have also caused his lack of 
        respect among the retreating men while Hancock’s mere sight caused the 
        men to stand at their posts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day saw the concentration of both armies and 
        Lee’s attack on both flanks. On the right, where Howard’s line was, Lee’s 
        attack was forced back after some heavy fighting while on the extreme 
        left, a little known professor from Bowdoin named Joshua Chamberlain saved 
        the day, and possibly the Union. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Meade posed a question to his corps commanders. 
        Should they stay, retreat, or attack? Howard was in favor of an attack 
        late the next afternoon, but the third day of Gettysburg saw Pickett’s 
        ill-fated assault, and after its carnage, neither commanders had the will 
        for another attack. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Battle of Gettysburg had ended, and Howard had 
        come no where close to regaining his pre-Chancellorsville reputation.
