      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin College Museum of Art invites you back to a time 
        when train whistles blew and subways were still a novelty in the urban 
        world. Twenty-six college faculty and staff were invited to view a selection 
        of photographs from the Museum's permanent collection, choose one of particular 
        interest, and respond to that image in 100 words or less. Their responses 
        form the wall text throughout the exhibition in the Museum's Halford Gallery. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;How has transportation changed in recent history, as the result 
        of revolutions in politics and the economy, redefining class-consciousness 
        in the modern era? How do these images invoke personal life experiences 
        and perceptions of that recent history? The Bowdoin College Museum challenges 
        the viewer to locate a photograph that inspires a historical or personal 
        memory and quite literally-be moved.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;John Vachon's image of the <i>Railroad Men at Lunch</i> inspired 
        Joe Bandy, Assistant Professor of Sociology/Anthropology, in its social 
        and historical context. He recalls that in1939, the year the photograph 
        was printed, <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> was published and the United States 
        suffered the effects of the Great Depression. Germany invaded Poland in 
        this same year, ushering in WWII and giving new meaning to the phrase 
        "UNION," as it appears in striking white against the dark background of 
        the 832 train. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The two figures lunching underneath the looming steam train 
        appear diminutive in comparison to the means of transport, also the basis 
        of their economic livelihood. This was a historical moment for the labor 
        movement and the relationship of the men to that formidable machine, and 
        the power of this black and white image, reminds the viewer of the events 
        of that pivotal year. Both personal and historical memories are invoked 
        in Alfred Stieglitz's <i>The Hand of Man</i>. One of the Museum Security 
        Guards, Jaime Reatiraza, recalls his fascination with trains while growing 
        up in the Philippines: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"As a young boy, I remember when I first saw this machine 
        at a far distance. She was lumbering slowly at the curve looking like 
        a centipede. Passing through the open rice fields where our village was 
        located, I could see it belching gray smoke as it unleashed its eerie 
        whistle. For us young kids we were fascinated and hypnotized by the awesome 
        machine. It became part of our life."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The black and white train, among the series of tracks with 
        billowing black smoke, elicited a different response from Visiting Assistant 
        Professor of Psychology, Scott Staples:"Bursting forth like an ancient, 
        angry god, blackening the sky it holds all within its sway. Power without 
        grace, without redemption, even the great earth must submit and be imprisoned 
        by the technological titan."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Is the train a game or a god? A childhood memory invoking 
        intrigue of the great beyond, or a supernatural technological force polluting 
        the natural world? Come decide for yourself.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship of man to more modern forms of transportation 
        continues to strike a social cord. Rachel Connelly, Associate Professor 
        of Economics and Director of Women's Studies selected Danny Lyon's 1979 
        print entitled IRT2, South Bronx, NYC, a black and white image of a crowded 
        subway train. The inside shell is covered in graffiti and each one of 
        the sitters appears to be unaware of the presence of the photographer. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Connelly is interested in the role of the commuter 
        rail in the reduction of worker inequality, understanding the economic 
        importance of fast and inexpensive public transportation for many minority 
        employees. The people on this subway train do not interact with one another, 
        and one man reads a Mexican newspaper. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Though public transportation should serve as a way of reducing 
        class barriers, the high filter used to create the black and white contrast 
        in this photograph, the white woman staring out the window bathed in light, 
        further highlights the social stratification prevalent in 20th century 
        America.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The invention of the automobile also changed our perceptions 
        of history and memory. Genevieve LeMoine, Curator of the Perry Mac-Millan 
        Arctic Museum, speaks of photography as an artistic media:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"A photograph records experiences that happen in the blink 
        of an eye, but comes to stand for much more than the instant it preserves. 
        In this picture I can feel the thrill of speeding along a narrow road 
        at night and the trusting comfort of a small child safe in the warmth 
        of the car…<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In her choice of the blurred Thomas Zetterstrom print entitled 
        <i>Night Drive</i>, the viewer is allowed inside of the vehicle, aware 
        of the fast speed and the dark road filled with trees, cut by the headlights 
        of the car. The hood of the car forms a shadowy diagonal slant, perhaps 
        merely a nighttime ghost or trick of the light. Emphasis is on the power 
        of motion and the sense of invincibility one so often feels when speeding 
        through the night in a steel-framed automobile."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Kidder Smith, Program Director of Asian Studies, presents 
        a different interpretation of automotive transportation, emphasizing its 
        destructive capabilities. In his selection of Garry Winogrand's <i>Utah</i>, 
        the viewer once again locates himself inside of the vehicle, this time 
        faced with the formidable obstacle of a lumbering animal straight ahead, 
        as seen through the smattered windshield. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The driver is unable to stop or react, propelled forward by 
        this evil machine. Professor Smith's last line serves as a fleeting after-thought 
        when faced with one's own mortality: "My wife was sleeping in the backseat." 
        This response reflects on the greater power of technology to destroy the 
        innocent- whether the environment or human life.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;R.S.V.P. is a striking exhibition, allowing the audience to 
        see how members of the Bowdoin community interpret art, be it historically 
        or personally, impacted by different time periods and memories throughout 
        the past century. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin College Museum of Art invites you to experience 
        these works for yourself, choose one that moves you and formulate your 
        own response in 100 words or less. Which of these photographs moves you? 
        Until January 2001, come find out. </p>
