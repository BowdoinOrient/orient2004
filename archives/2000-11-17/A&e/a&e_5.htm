      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of opportunities to expand your horizons and appreciate 
        the finer things in life. This one is no exception: the Bowdoin College 
        Concert Band is presenting its fall semester concert this Saturday, November 
        18th at 7:30 p.m. in Kresge. For those of you who have never witnessed 
        the awesome power that is the Concert Band, I'm not sure anything I say 
        can truly prepare you for the experience. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;It's pretty intense. Seriously though, this year the band 
        has made incredible progress in developing a cohesive sound, building 
        on a strong foundation of experienced players returning from last year. 
        A strong crop of newcomers, including several talented first-years, has 
        also contributed greatly to the group's sound this year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; In the fall semester concert, director John Morneau has put 
        this newly strengthened sound to the test, selecting five challenging 
        yet popular pieces for audience enjoyment. Included in this prestigious 
        lineup is Charles Ives' "Old Home Suite" with its own tripped-out interpretation 
        of the popular children's tune "London Bridge is Falling Down," as well 
        as the rousing "Florentiner March" from the movie <i>Brassed Off</i>. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps most conspicuous among them is "A Copland Portrait," 
        which highlights some of the beloved contemporary composer's most popular 
        pieces. You know that song, the one with all the trumpets and French horns 
        on the beginning, the one that sounds like it should be played when Olympic 
        athletes take the field? You've heard it before; it's called "Fanfare 
        for the Common Man," and it opens up this fabulous piece. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;There is another notorious tune hidden in "A Copland Portrait," 
        but to find out what it is, you'll have to come to the concert. So with 
        that tease, enrich your cultural acumen and come listen to some great 
        music on Saturday night at 7:30 in Kresge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;You might end up humming some good tunes at the end of the 
        night, instead of Britney Spears. </p>
