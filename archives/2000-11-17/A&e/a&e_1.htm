      <p><font size="2">&nbsp;<font size="3">&nbsp;It sometimes seems that Bowdoin 
        students need more things to talk about. Everyone has experienced those 
        awkward silences at dinner, with roommates or team members, when you know 
        you <i>should</i> be talking about something, but either no one can muster 
        the energy to start up a conversation or there simply isn't anything worth 
        discussing that hasn't been hashed out many times before (election, anyone?). 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Thankfully, the Department of Theater and Dance has given 
        us a solution to this recurring problem. This weekend, <i>The Visit</i>, 
        a play by Friedrich Dürrenmatt will be performed at Pickard Theater on 
        Friday and Saturday nights. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing from an incredible variety of resources in the Bowdoin 
        community and beyond, <i>The Visit</i> presents a rich tapestry of lush 
        imagery and visual effects, intriguing social questions, and, of course, 
        some of the finest acting this side of Boston. <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Visit</i> focuses on two central themes: how far people 
        will go for money-and how they can justify their subsequent actions-and 
        on a more personal level, the desire for revenge when someone is horribly 
        wronged. It tells the story of a woman, Claire Zachanassian (played by 
        Kristina Balbo '01) who is badly maligned by her lover at a young age. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; She leaves the town, which in the years after her departure 
        falls under hard economic times. When she finally returns, she has become 
        the wealthiest woman in the world. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Claire offers to help the town by giving its citizens one 
        million dollars, but under one ghastly condition: they must murder the 
        man who wronged her so many years ago. <br>
        The cast of <i>The Visit</i> is composed of students from all different 
        parts of campus, and students participate in all aspects of production; 
        most actors even fill more than one role. Says Eric Legris '03, who plays 
        Claire's son, "It's such a friendly atmosphere backstage; it's like a 
        party." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Of his character, he says that "the son is suffering from, 
        as his father would say, 'no morals or standards.' He's influenced by 
        the power of materialism." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He also says of the play that although "it seems like we've 
        been working on it for so long, we've achieved much more than we ever 
        expected." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As the first production by the department of the semester, 
        <i>The Visit</i> takes full advantage of the brand new, entirely updated 
        Pickard Theater. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As glim-psed last year in the spring semester production 
        of <i>Evita</i>, the renovations that modified this space make possible 
        a whole host of innovations in set design and lighting which were not 
        feasible before its reconstruction. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Davis Robinson, professor of theater and director of <i>The 
        Visit</i>, says he is excited to be able to fully utilize "the power of 
        Pickard" in a show with so many "imaginative possibilities." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; As Robinson states in the program, <i>The Visit</i> is a 
        play that provides unlimited opportunities to play, to create imaginative 
        designs, to explore characters, and to learn about the true nature of 
        ensemble and choral work. It is a story that swings wildly between tragedy, 
        romance, and grotesque comedy." This collaborative element is strikingly 
        clear from a sampling of the many departments involved in the play's production. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The music department especially has played a key role in 
        developing myriad additional effects, including an original composition 
        by Francis Kayali '01 which incorporates piano and choral elements into 
        the finale. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Contributors from outside Bowdoin have also put tremendous 
        effort into the aesthetic aspects of the production; the costume and set 
        designers, Helen Rasmussen and Judy Gailen respectively, have done work 
        in such venues as Mad Horse Theatre in Portland, Yale Drama School, and 
        the Opera Company of Philadelphia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Robinson hopes that <i>The Visit</i> will provide an opportunity 
        for students and community members to get out and experience theater in 
        a social as well as academic context. He says of the role of theater at 
        Bowdoin, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a way to weave cultural, social, and academic life 
        together, as well as an opportunity for students to participate in production." 
        He mentioned President Edwards' call for the college to develop a "culturally 
        active life," and believes that theater is an excellent way to bring out 
        this life on campus. <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Visit</i> provides more than conversational fodder; 
        it presents an amazing array of fascinating issues that will keep audience 
        members pondering for a long time to come. The show is playing Friday 
        and Saturday(sorry, opening night was Thursday) at 8 p.m. at Pickard Theater. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Tickets are free with Bowdoin ID, $5 without ID. And while 
        we know how far Bowdoin students will go for $250, murder and revenge 
        are sure to provide much more exciting entertainment, as well as something 
        to think about. </font></font></p>
