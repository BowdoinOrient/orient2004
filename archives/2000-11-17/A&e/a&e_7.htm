      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor are you," a voice said and Steve's sword was slapped 
        away from Pat's neck. Pat looked up and saw Professor Marek squaring off 
        with Steve, brandishing his cane, which now had a long blade protruding 
        from the end of it! Over by the booklift, James stood proudly over the 
        two unconscious buyers, hammer in hand, as he favored his right leg.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As Steve attacked the Professor, Pat noticed that Marek put 
        his weight on both his feet without stumbling or even wincing. But his 
        questions were answered as Steve questioned the Professor for him.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"I see your foot has healed nicely," he said sardonically. 
        "Why don't you tell your friends here who was responsible for Jon falling 
        from his window."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, I have to admit that I was the one who threw him out 
        of a window, but not his own," Marek replied as turned aside Steve's sword 
        and swung his own in a wide arc. "Jon Savage had been intoxicated with 
        a strongly concentrated, and likely lethal, dose of heroin when I found 
        him in his room. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I knew he had to get to the hospital, but I also knew that 
        I could not let anyone know I had been there. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I broke his window and then dropped him from the first 
        story bathroom to look like he had fallen on his own. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;That is why he is alive now. The dose of heroin surely would 
        have killed him without hospitalization. I also injected a painkiller 
        into the back of his neck so he would not feel the bruises from his fall."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Steve parried the Professor's blade with his own and turned 
        it out wide, giving him room to throw in a punch, which Marek easily blocked 
        with his free hand. "But why were you in Jon's room?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Three years ago, before I got a job teaching legal studies 
        for Bowdoin, I worked for the FBI. After the first boy fell to his death, 
        I was asked by the President to investigate secretly.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I chose to cover myself with the cane so no one would suspect 
        me, but I found your MP3 file and followed you around Coleman Hall," Marek 
        explained at length. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He whipped his cane around and struck a hard blow near the 
        base of Steve's weapon and knocked it from his hand. It landed near Pat 
        and he grabbed it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Just one question," he said, pointing the tip of the blade 
        to Steve's throat. "Why did you kill the first boy and then your own partner?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Security knew something was going on," Steve explained, a 
        look of resentment on his face, "so I had to cause distractions. Jon didn't 
        like the idea of these 'distractions' and threatened to rat on me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; He became the next distraction, though not as well as I thought." 
        Marek nodded and looked over to make sure James was still doing well with 
        his captives.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Steve moved quickly, taking advantage of the moment the Professor 
        was looking away, and slapped his cane aside, grabbing Pat's blade up 
        off the floor and driving it through Marek's shoulder as he spun back 
        around. Steve wrenched his blade free and moved to strike again, but Pat 
        stepped in and blocked the thrust with Steve's sword. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Their blades whirred thought the air as Pat pushed Steve back 
        toward the booklift. Pat was gaining ground, but he still knew that he 
        had far less experience than the captain of the fencing team.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Steve turned onto the offensive and Pat knew he 
        had to try a desperate maneuver if he was going to escape this fight with 
        his life and the lives of his friends, for it was clear that Steve did 
        not plan on letting any of them out of the building alive with his secret. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As Steve came across with Professor Marek's blade, instead 
        of blocking it, Pat dove into a roll under it and came up in a crouching 
        position, slicing backward with Steve's blade as he did and drawing a 
        deep gash in Steve's calf. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Enraged, Steve turned and attacked again, but suddenly stopped, 
        a look of horror on his face as he felt the concentrated heroin solution 
        spreading throughout his body. His saber fell from his limp hand and clattered 
        to the floor. Steve sank to his knees, his eyes rolled back into his head, 
        and he slumped to the ground in unconsciousness.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Shouts from the stairwell echoed through the quiet chamber.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"I told my wife to call 9-1-1 at 3:00," Marek explained as 
        policemen rushed into the room. It was only when six paramedics entered 
        the room that Pat realized his back was covered in blood from numerous 
        cuts he had received from the broken glass, some of which were fairly 
        deep. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He allowed one EMT to help him get his shirt off and clean 
        the cuts.</p>
      <p align="center">*******************************************************</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital the next morning, Pat and James were visited 
        by Scott and Drew. Scott had a cast on his wrist, but otherwise, seemed 
        fine. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;They reported that Jon Savage was conscious, but under tight 
        security and would face legal problems as well as suspension. But Steve 
        Gades, on the other hand, faced expulsion and prison. Then the two left 
        to go back to the campus to search their room for anything that had survived 
        the holocaust. Then Professor Marek came into the room, his arm in a sling.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't worry, I've had worse," he said with a smile.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Like that awful sprain of yours?" James said sarcastically.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah," Marek agreed. "Actually, that one wasn't all that 
        bad."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"We're lucky we ran into you," Pat told Marek.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;"Likewise," he replied. "I could not have taken on all three 
        of them. Of course, they may not have known I was coming. I had the sense 
        to delete the MP3 file before they found me. Though now I wish I had it. 
        No one believes me!"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;James reached into his pocket and pulled out the small plastic 
        disk and handed it to the Professor. "I think you could use this."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Marek pocketed the disk and smiled. "Then maybe you can answer 
        this for me," he said. "What does 'Desert Rose' mean?"<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;James explained their interpretation of the phrase.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Marek nodded. "I see that oases do spring up." He smiled. 
        "I'll let you two rest. I should go check on Steve."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;He left the room and James winked at Pat. "Do you think we 
        should lock the door?"</p>
