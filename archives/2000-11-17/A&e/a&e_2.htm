      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sinking 
        to a new depth of poor taste. At first I was happy to report that I actually 
        watched a movie that I enjoyed for this week's column. I don't know if 
        any of you have noticed, but recently the movies I have been watching 
        have been absolutely terrible. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen finer workmanship floating in the inside of a 
        toilet bowl as compared to the videos I have been reviewing. So naturally 
        when I realized I was actually enjoying this week's film, I was glad to 
        acknowledge that the slump was over, and there really are some good direct-to-video 
        films out there. People, the movie I watched was titled <i>Prayer of the 
        Rollerboys</i>, and starred Corey Haim on rollerblades. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I actually thought this piece of feces was a good movie. 
        What's happening to me? As a result of watching these fine films on a 
        weekly basis, my standards are lowering and I am losing all semblance 
        of having good taste. For those of you who may have been too young to 
        remember the "Corey and Corey" craze of the mid 1980's, allow me to inform 
        you that Corey Haim was once a big star, idolized by brace-faced girls 
        across America. His face appeared on stickers and foldouts right next 
        to Kirke Cameron posters inside Trapper Keepers in every school in the 
        nation. Alongside his cinematic co-star Corey Feldman, he dominated the 
        pre-teen market of crappy movies about high school tribulations and teenage 
        fantasies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Corey and Corey starred in such classics as <i>License to 
        Drive</i> and <i>The Lost Boys</i>. Now some fifteen years later, Corey 
        Haim shows his face from the depths of oblivion in <i>Prayer of the Rollerboys</i>. 
        Rest assured his hairstyle has not changed a bit; and he still wears a 
        headband. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The movie is set in the not-too-distant future in the chaotic 
        remnants of an old city. The previous generation was consumed with greed 
        and borrowed too much money, causing "the great crash." The world left 
        in the wake of the parental generation's folly is a pseudo-post-apocalyptic 
        Mad Max-styled environment. But instead of the ruling faction being hooligans 
        with cars waging a war for fuel, they are kids on roller skates. The Rollerboys 
        are led by the evil Gary Lee, who recruits the city's youth to peddle 
        mind-numbing drugs to the ignorant and destitute public. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Corey Haim plays Griffin, a hard working and upstanding citizen, 
        struggling to lead a good life in a corrupt world, always looking out 
        for his vulnerable little brother. Griffin is also one of the best rollerbladers 
        in the city, making him a prime candidate to become a Rollerboy. Griffin 
        is not tempted to join, but when the Rollerboys recruit his little brother, 
        he decides to work undercover for the police and takes down Gary Lee's 
        fascist organization. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; But, as time progresses, Griffin descends into the depths 
        of darkness, as he is consumed by a lifestyle of vice and violence. Will 
        he make it out of the gang alive? Can he save his brother? Will he single-handedly 
        dismantle the Rollerboy's organization? <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What do you think?! Of course he does. What worries me is 
        that I actually really liked this movie. In fact, I am not even going 
        to give you a play-by-play of the plot, for fear of giving it away, as 
        if any of you are going to run out and rent this film. What's wrong with 
        me? <i>Prayer of the Rollerboys</i> gets an A-. Don't miss my next column 
        - I may finally get around to watching a Terry "Hulk" Hogan flick, although 
        <i>Women's Penitentiary 6</i> is looking awfully appealing. </font></p>
