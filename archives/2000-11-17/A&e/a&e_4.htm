      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Things are starting to get chilly here in Maine. Soon the 
        snow will be falling, and who doesn't enjoy a nice walk on a snowy evening? 
        So to commemorate this wonderful time that is approaching, the Film Society 
        is bringing you a program of films celebrating nature and all it's glory. 
        Part of the weekend (Saturday night to be exact) features the arrival 
        of the touring portion of the Mountainfilm Festival, a 23 year old film 
        festival based out of Telluride, CO. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a truly special treat that will bring some great films 
        to Bowdoin. But first, on Friday night, we'll be presenting a couple of 
        movies showing what may happen next time you venture out into the wilderness 
        to go camping. As always, the events are free and open to the public; 
        but this time, there is a little catch. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;You will need a ticket to see Mountainfilm. They are available 
        at the Smith Union info desk. The tickets are free with a Bowdoin ID, 
        but will cost the public $5. All the films will be shown in Smith Auditorium 
        in Sills Hall.</p>

        <i>Deliverance</i> (1972)<br>
        <font size="2">Directed by: John Boorman<br>
        Starring: John Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox, <br>
        <img src="../../Standard_Graphics/blank.gif" width="46" height="1"> Ned 
        Beatty, James Dickey</font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This film shows you what you do not want to happen when you 
        are alone in the woods. Four businessmen decide to take a weekend canoeing 
        trip in a remote backwoods part of our country. Along the way, there are 
        a number of accidents, plus a run-in with a group of inbred rednecks. 
        These folks are scary! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;They make Cleatus the Slack-jawed Yokel look like a member 
        of High Society. The scenes with these people are the best, and the most 
        famous. You have the classic "Squeal like a pig" scene, which is very 
        disturbing. But the film's highlight comes right before the canoes are 
        put into the water. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;While in the hillbilly village, our characters come across 
        a boy with a banjo. One of the heroes happens to have his guitar with 
        him, and he and the boy begin to play. That's right, <i>Dueling Banjos</i>. 
        What a great song. You all probably can hum it, but once you've seen the 
        song in the context of the film, it will never feel the same when you 
        hear it. Rated R</p>
      <p> Friday at 9pm<br>
        <i>The Great Outdoors</i> (1988) <br>
        <font size="2">Directed by: Howard Deutch <br>
        Starring: Dan Aykroyd, John Candy, Stephanie Faracy, Annette Bening </font><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Candy and his family head out to a lakeside camping area to 
        get away from the city life. He is optimistic about the trip, but his 
        family is not. Their fears are justified when the in-laws (Aykroyd and 
        his family) show up to ruin things. John Hughes, the king of 80's comedies, 
        wrote the film, so there are lots of silly gags and situations, but no 
        overall deep message. Still, it's a fun film that you'll enjoy. Rated 
        PG </p>
      <p>Saturday at 7pm<br>
        The Mountainfilm Festival<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;This event will feature three hours of shorts and features 
        from around the world that celebrate nature. The films will approach nature 
        from many different angles, some of which are education, conservation, 
        entertainment and adventure. The event is co-sponsored by the Film Society, 
        the Outing Club and the Bowdoin Greens (thanks guys!). Since this is such 
        a big event and seating is limited, you will need a ticket to get in. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;But don't worry, you can get them for free from the friendly 
        people at the Smith Union info desk. The tour director, Rick Silverman, 
        will present the event. He has a wide range of films to show, but here 
        are some descriptions (supplied by the tour's main office) of the films 
        that will most likely be presented. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>ODE TO AVALANCHE</i> - Few forces in nature are as frightening, 
        or as dazzling, as an avalanche. Marvels of physics, they have the capacity 
        to sweep climbers or skiers to their death, destroy entire villages and 
        fill the senses with awe. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>GATHERERS FROM THE SKY</i> - The Minang live on the shores 
        of Sumatra's Lake Maninjao inside a crater formed by three volcanoes and 
        surrounded by three million coconut trees. But the Minang no longer climb 
        these trees, instead relying upon monkeys for the harvest. Bourhan is 
        now an old man, however, and no longer can train monkeys... yet a strained 
        marriage and his wife's inheritance begin to unravel his plans for a calmer 
        life. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>TURTLE WORLD</i> - A lushly animated allegory about a turtle 
        passing through space, and providing a richly forested home to the monkeys 
        that come to dwell upon its shell. In their industriousness, however, 
        they begin to exploit the resources of their paradisiacal state. The consequence 
        is their falling from grace. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>LEGACY: KILLING A RAIN FOREST</i> - Simply contrasting 
        the clear reality of on-site photography with the continuing public relations 
        blitz of the timber industry, this film documents the barbaric annihilation 
        of British Columbia's last great coastal forests. The frightening legacy 
        the film describes is almost as chilling for its illustration of the effectiveness 
        of the modern "big lie" as it is for its undeniable proof that we are 
        losing so much of the world's natural resources. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>SULPHUR PASSAGE</i> - A visual and oral tour-de-force, 
        this film captures the energies of the people of British Columbia to resist 
        the further decimation of the Clayoquot sound. Based on a reference to 
        a famed rallying cry of the Spanish Civil War, this film is the collaborative 
        product of dozens of filmmakers, musicians, and activists ...an eloquent 
        effort to save this great temperate rain forest...and a harkening back 
        to an earlier era when the lyrics of folksingers and balladeers drove 
        our own revolutions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>THE FATAL GAME</i> - Australian Mike Rheinberger, 52, had 
        tried six times to reach the summit of Everest and failed. It remained 
        his ultimate dream. The seventh time he would not give up. With New Zealand 
        guide and cameraman Mark Whetu to record the great moment of his life, 
        he summited. Perhaps he should have been more concerned that it was so 
        late in the day and their hopes of descending to camp six were disappearing 
        in the sunset. But, dreams and games have a mesmerizing quality, and both 
        men became captured in the same strange dance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <i>THE MAN WHO PLANTED TREES</i> - Based upon a Jean Giono 
        novella, and lovingly illustrated by Academy Award-winning animator Frederic 
        Bach, this story of a man1s life of quiet fulfillment in an obscure region 
        of France. This Academy Award-winning film remains the favorite Festival 
        film...beautiful and powerful and inspiring. <br>
