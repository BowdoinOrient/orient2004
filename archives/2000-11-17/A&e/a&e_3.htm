      <!-- #BeginEditable "Text" --> 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I apologize for the lack of <i>Maine Brews</i> for the past 
        couple of weeks, but I have been involving myself with such trifles as 
        figuring out what I'm going to do with my life and winning an unprecedented 
        third straight League A Intramural Soccer Championship. Although not a 
        beer, Carlo Rossi receives the highest praise from this column. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On a similar note, to the ever-growing list of things that 
        Hampshire Special Ale accomplishes, I must add the fact that it is a great 
        celebratory beer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; What is not a great celebratory beer, or a beer great for 
        anything else, however, is Allagash's White Ale. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; White Ale is the feature this week for two reasons. First 
        of all, Joshua's offered it on special Thursday several weeks ago, so 
        perhaps you were down there and read my review the next day and agreed 
        with my humble, yet strong opinions about this particular Maine beer. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The second reason that prompted me to write on Allagash is 
        a peculiar experience I had on a particular Tuesday. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I was celebrating winning victory (for those of you not in 
        the know, that is in fact proper grammar) with my mug of HSA with my soccer 
        mates when a friend brought to our table of about seven dedicated beer 
        drinkers a sample of the White Ale in a double shot glass. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This glass was past throughout the group, and to my surprise, 
        when everyone was done trying it, the glass was still half empty, with 
        no takers on finishing it off. Astounding! This proved to me the conviction 
        that I have had for some time: Allagash's White Ale, brewed in Belgian 
        style, is a Maine Beer not worth the effort. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I respect Rob Todd, who was at Joshua's that particular week, 
        for trying to provide Maine beer drinkers with something new, but I have 
        no respect for the outcome of this enterprise. There is something to the 
        fact that I just don't enjoy Belgian Ales that much anyway. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For those of you looking for a reference point in a discussion 
        of Belgian Ales, you may have tried Blue Moon Ale, which has properties 
        similar to Allagash's White. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; To me the most apparent trait of a Belgian Ale is the effectiveness 
        with which it clogs up your taste buds and makes you crave a nice cold 
        glass of water to break up the film that has formed on your tongue.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen many a night that promised to be filled with 
        the tasting of great beers well into the wee hours ended abruptly with 
        a too soon-sampling of a Belgian Ale. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; This beer is not conducive to night of hearty laughter and 
        outlandish storytelling among friends in their favorite pub, but rather 
        it makes its drinker immediately think about what sitcoms run that night 
        on TV and about the quickest way home from the bar.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I can imagine a world where an adept brewer may limit the 
        problems presented by the traditional process of brewing Belgian Ales 
        and take advantage of some of its potential strengths.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if I were the brewer of a Belgian Ale, I would 
        be very dedicated to making the taste of the beer as pleasing as the hue 
        that it achieves when poured into a clear pint glass. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; One friend summed up its color splendidly by comparing it 
        to the nectar of the gods. It has an opaque quality and a pleasing nectarine 
        tint which causes the beer to almost glow. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, its taste, summed up by a different friend 
        but with equal insight reminds one of the most mundane of liquids: milk. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; The thought of Hera tricking Zeus into drinking Allagash's 
        White Ale instead of Nectar as punishment for one of his amorous escapades 
        is delightful, but the sad truth is far from light hearted. I think with 
        some tinkering, Allagash may be able to alleviate the overpowering and 
        oppressive effect its beer has on its drinker, but it will take some work.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been harsh on Allagash, but I do hold out hope for 
        there future. Perhaps they will unveil at the Brewer's Fest in Portland 
        (less than two weeks away; PREPARE YOURSELF) a beer of subtlety and grace 
        that will win me over, but only time will tell. That is all for this week. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoy your next pint, and especially this week, if you have 
        problems with my assessment of Allagash, you are again invited to buy 
        the pints and we can talk about it, but I'm not promising I'll finish 
        it. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, I can be reached at pleigh@bowdoin.edu or on the 
        air Thursdays from 4-5:30 on WBOR 91.1. </p>
