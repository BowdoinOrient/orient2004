      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten days after the November 7 election, the U.S. still 
        has not chosen a successor for President Bill Clinton. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The election has come down to Florida, where the original 
        count gave Governor George W. Bush the lead and thus, in theory, the presidency. 
        However, the margin of Governor Bush’s victory was so small that the Florida 
        election law mandated a recount. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This recount was initially scheduled to be completed 
        by this past Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. At that time, Florida’s Secretary of 
        State Katherine Harris announced that after the recount, Governor Bush 
        had a 300-vote lead over the Vice President. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the overseas ballots, which traditionally 
        lean Republican, are still being counted through today, although they 
        will likely maintain his lead. It seems unlikely that the election will 
        be decided by the end of today, though, as a variety of lawsuits are still 
        waiting to be heard. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One problem is the unresolved ballot issue in Palm 
        Beach and Broward Counties, Florida. The Palm Beach ballots have come 
        under a great deal of criticism for their design. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to vote, a person must punch out a hole for 
        his or her candidate. Sometimes, however, the hole is ambiguous, and the 
        computer cannot read the ballot and therefore disregards it. The Democrats 
        have said that they are hoping that a manual recount of the ballots will 
        give Gore a majority in Florida. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Broward County is having many of the same problems, 
        but officials have not yet decided to perform a hand recount. However, 
        that decision might be made for them if a Democratic lawsuit succeeds 
        in mandating a recount. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions still remain as to whether these recounts 
        will even matter, though. Bush spokesperson Karen Hughes said she believes 
        that “counties controlled by Democrats have said they may continue a manual 
        count. Yet if they go forward after the deadline, these Democratic counties 
        are…attempting to reinterpret the results.” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another problem that has surfaced in the past couple 
        days in Florida deals with incorrect votes. Democrats contend that the 
        ballots in some counties are misleading. They argue that many Gore supporters 
        failed to understand the punch ballot and voted for Pat Buchanan instead 
        of Gore. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democratic lawyers are scheduled for a court hearing 
        today where they will try to determine the constitutionality of a revote. 
        This is a very controversial topic, though, and will likely not be decided 
        until it reaches the Florida Supreme Court. In general, most, if not all, 
        of the lawsuits will likely be heard by the Florida Supreme Court, as 
        both Democrats and Republicans agree that the decisions should be made 
        by the same court. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one seems to know when and how the court will decide, 
        and so the results of this election may not be known for some time. However, 
        if litigation does not affect the election, an unlikely scenario, then 
        the absentee ballots and recounts should all be tabulated by Monday night. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it stands now, it appears that the Republicans will 
        control the House and Senate by only the narrowest of margins. Additionally, 
        the next president will have to govern when he has only won by a handful 
        of votes. Many have begun to question what the government will be able 
        to accomplish regardless of who wins. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaders like Senator Trent Lott (R) have said that 
        they believe that, without a clear mandate, the Republicans and Democrats 
        will have to work together at a time when everyone agrees that there are 
        vast ideological differences between them. Lott did try to reassure Americans 
        by noting that President Jefferson, our third president, was chosen only 
        after 36 ballots in Congress, and he did okay. </p>
