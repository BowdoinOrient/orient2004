The top five New England teams earned all-expense-paid trips to Spokane, and the Bears, who found themselves on the bottom of a tight 4 team pack competing for two spots, were left out in the cold.  \par Keene State won the race with 38 points, and was followed closely by Williams (52), who raced to second behind the 3-4 finish of Dusty Lopez and Tim Campbell. Tufts rounded out the top three, leaving four teams and only two spots. Trinity (197) and Coast Guard (201) were the final qualifiers, leaving MIT (208) and Bowdoin (214) disappointed and frustrated. \par \ldblquote I was disappointed,\rdblquote  said Steve Allison \lquote 01, whose 6th place finish was a bright spot for the Bears. However, the post-race comments of Allison dealt primarily with his state of disappointment over this season\rquote s results, \ldblquote The team was too flat before the race. I could sense from everyone that they wanted it, but they put too much pressure on themselves. We weren\rquote t as carefree as we were at NESCACs.\rdblquote  \par Allison and his teammates were visibly frustrated by their failure to qualify. They beat both Tufts and Trinity just two weeks ago, and missing qualifying by a mere 14 points is a difficult pill to  swallow. However, the silver lining to this particularly dark and stormy cloud is that commencement in May will be just another day for the Bowdoin men. Not one of their runners will receive his diploma, leaving hope for next year. \ldblquote This team could be the best Bowdoin has ever seen,\rdblquote  said Allison, \ldblquote but we still have to prove ourselves, we can\rquote t beat teams with potential, we have to beat them before the race  with long runs during the summer and hard workouts. Potential is a beautiful thing, but it has to be worked on; it doesn\rquote t realize itself. We learned that this season.\rdblquote  \par The theme of learning from the loss was an important one for Allison, in a season that was riddled with injuries and roller-coaster- like ups and downs, all of which were carefully mitigated by NESCAC Coach-of-the Year Peter Slovenski.  Slovenski\rquote s receipt of the award was, along with Allison\rquote s performance a bright spot for the Bears.\par Allison, a tough critic of his usually outstanding performances, added, \ldblquote I didn\rquote t step it up. I had beaten everybody except Perez [Race winner Wilson Perez of Keene State] convincingly. I just had a poor race. I fell down in the mud at the two-mile mark and went from 3rd to 12th in a matter of seconds. I blew my race right there and was lucky to qualify.\rdblquote  \par It wasn\rquote t lucky that Allison qualified for Nationals, and to most informed observers, it wasn\rquote t a surprise either. However, another bright spot for the Bears was the surprise performance of sophomore Todd Forsgren. As the season has progressed, Forsgren, constantly running with the weight of the dismal Cleveland Browns on his shoulders, has steadily improved, becoming Allison\rquote s right hand man. Like Lenin and Trotsky, these two have spread the word about Bowdoin Cross Country. In the NESCAC race that Allison won, Forsgren was close behind in 7th. That proximity continued at UMass-Dartmouth, with Forsgren placing a  strong 18th, just 30 seconds off Allison\rquote s place. The race earned Todd a place in the National Championships. \ldblquote I\rquote m very honored to be able to represent Bowdoin in Spokane this year. I have been running head-to-head with a number of runners who have qualified for nationals in the past. However, when I got to the finish line, I was still a bit shocked that I had run as well as I had.\rdblquote \par So the Bowdoin cross country season goes on, with Steve Allison and Todd Forsgren packing their black and white jerseys and heading on a cross-continental pilgrimage to the Pacific North West. Allison, who placed 36th, last year, could be in the top ten if he has his A-game.  Forsgren, who surprised the pundits on a weekly basis, could be in the running for the top 50, and even a dark horse for All-American honors, which go to the top 35 finishers.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\fs94 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs52\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports }2\par \pard\plain \s2\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel1\adjustright \b\fs28\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Ready to swim}\par \pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\scaps\cf1 Lauren McNally}{\line }{\caps\fs16 Staff writer}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\adjustright \f62\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 Bowdoin\rquote s varsity swimmers began their season two Wednesdays ago at 6:30 a.m.  For the first time in 40 years, the Polar Bears will not be swimming for the legendary Charlie Butt.  This summer, the athletic department hired Brad Burnham for the swim team\rquote s new head coach.  Burnham comes to Bowdoin from a six-year assistant coaching position for the UCLA women\rquote s team. As quoted on the sports info site, Jeff Ward states: \ldblquote We are fortunate to have a teacher and coach of Brad\rquote s quality running our men\rquote s and women\rquote s swimming programs. He has worked with some of the finest swimmers in the country and I expect him to create a great swimming atmosphere here at Bowdoin.\rdblquote    Also joining the new coaching staff as assistant coach is Mark Glauth, a champion cyclist (4-time Tour de France participant) and knowledgeable stroke technician.  With new faces on deck, the team is ready for this upcoming meet season.\par Let\rquote s begin with the women\rquote s team.  They were 4-5 last season and placed 7}{\fs10\cf0\up5 th }{\cf0 out of 31 teams at the New England Championships.  The lady bears lost some key members of the team to graduation, including backstroker Leigh Hoenig, medley swimmer and sprinter Kelsey Abbott, and top point scorer Julie Bard.  Most of the junior women are overseas this semester but will return for championship season in January.  Among them are sprinter and breastroker Elizabeth \ldblquote The BUELL\rdblquote  Buell, butterfliers Audrey Gray and Alyson Friedlander, breastroker Ali Quade and backstroker Melissa Tansey.  Luckily, the women\rquote s team has a strong nucleus of returning swimmers.  Catherine \ldblquote Destroyer\rdblquote  Williams \rquote 01 and Erin \ldblquote The Rocket\rdblquote  Veenker \rquote 01 lead as the team captains, and are members of Team Backstroke and Team Distance, respectively.  Seniors Jenny \ldblquote Phoenix\rdblquote  Mendelson and Meghan \ldblquote The Rock\rdblquote  Gregory contribute strongly to Team Sprint and middle distance.  Senior freestyler Jane \ldblquote Paris\rdblquote  Roberts returns after a year in France.  Sarah \ldblquote Puck\rdblquote  Hoenig \rquote 02 and Jenn \ldblquote Jacked\rdblquote  Laraia \rquote 03 fight the field in the breastroke events, and Annie \ldblquote Distance\rdblquote  Blair \rquote 03 joins Veenker in the distance events.  Three sophomore members of team sprint, Kara \ldblquote Pokey\rdblquote  Podkaminer \rquote 03, Lauren \ldblquote Hot Damn\rdblquote  McNally \rquote 03, and Anna \ldblquote The Predator\rdblquote  Podore \rquote 03 join Mendelson, while McNally also shares her meet time with the backstroke events.  Other strong sophomores are breastroker Allison \ldblquote the Beast\rdblquote  Benton, distance freestyler Allie \ldblquote Hinner\rdblquote  Hinman, and backstroker Meredith \ldblquote Lethal\rdblquote  Hoar. A strong group of first year students rounds out the women\rquote s team.  Kiele Mauricio brings incredible talent in all events, particularly the butterfly and medley.  Becky \ldblquote Yellowjacket\rdblquote  Grossman, Gillian \ldblquote Agent Scully\rdblquote  Stevens, Katherine \ldblquote the Rugger\rdblquote  Barnes, Alex \ldblquote west coast\rdblquote  de Rubira, Mary Melnik, Jen \ldblquote Montevideo\rdblquote  Montalvo, Jenny Scangos, Emily Scott, and Cara Tow create frosh team sprint for Bowdoin. \par The men\rquote s team finished last season with a record of 3-7, finishing 12}{\fs10\cf0\up5 th}{\cf0  out of 24 teams at the New England Championships.  The men are in an unusual situation, as they have no senior captains this year.  Junior sprinter Elliot \ldblquote Superman\rdblquote  Dickson and distance freestyler/backstroker Andy \ldblquote Euclid\rdblquote  Shaw fill the position of co-captains.  Returning members of the team core are backstroker and freestyler Matt \ldblquote Rastaman\rdblquote  Hammond \rquote 02, Nick \ldblquote Diesel\rdblquote  Driskill \rquote 02, butterflier Robie \ldblquote the Phish 1\rdblquote  Anson, sprinters Dave \ldblquote Skippy\rdblquote  Harden \rquote 03, Will \ldblquote Monty Python\rdblquote  Thomas \rquote 03, Josh \ldblquote Kingston\rdblquote  Kingsbury \lquote 03 and Todd \ldblquote Oregon\rdblquote  Williams \rquote 04, and team distance, John \ldblquote Cliffo\rdblquote  Clifford and Matt \ldblquote Iceman\rdblquote  Byrne.  Seniors Henry Bangert and Dan \ldblquote Yummy\rdblquote  Farnbach add depth to the men\rquote s team in freestyle and breastroke, respectively.  Freshman Mike \ldblquote the Phish 2\rdblquote  Long will be a top point scorer this season in the sprint freestyle and butterfly.\par Bowdoin also teams some fantastic divers up with the swim team.  Returning divers are sophomore Megan Lim and All-American diver Maureen Singer \rquote 01.  Freshmen Emily Howe, Brian McGregor, and Darryl Bernstein all show tremendous talent.  McGregor and Bernstein are the first divers to compete with the men\rquote s team in two years. \ldblquote Thanks to the svelte new divers, Bernstein and McGregor, we have the opportunity to pick up some extra points against some old rivals\rdblquote  states men\rquote s team co-captain Andy Shaw \rquote 02. \par \ldblquote We\rquote re going into this season completely blind\rdblquote , states Head Coach Brad Burnham, \ldblquote because there are so many athletes here who don\rquote t know their limits.  They don\rquote t know how fast they can go.  That opens up a lot of possibilities for us as coaches, because everyone is open to our new concepts of technique and training.\rdblquote  How about strengths and weaknesses?  \ldblquote I think one of the greatest strengths the team possesses as a whole is their intelligence\emdash they\rquote re willing to learn; they learn more quickly than any other group I\rquote ve ever worked with.\rdblquote   Assistant coach Mark Glauth adds, \ldblquote We have remarkable leadership on this team.  People are great about getting on task and focusing right away.  They\rquote re learning that there are more ways of measuring their success other than winning a race.\rdblquote  \par Some of the captains also had a word or two to say about the season and the new coaches.   \ldblquote Although it was hard to let Coach Charlie Butt go, Bowdoin could not have asked for two better coaches than Brad and Mark. Their hard work, long hours, and willingness to help us achieve our goals make swimming more fun.\rdblquote  states captain Elliot Dickson \rquote 02.  \par The Bowdoin swimmers will have their first regular-season test this weekend against at MIT (Babson will be there as well). \ldblquote I am really looking forward to seeing how the team does against Babson and MIT. The real competition is from Babson. We will be looking to go in hard and stick it to the Beavers right from the start\rdblquote  an eloquent Dickson reports. \par With all the evidence at hand, it is clear that the team is superb.\par  \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Ready to swim}}}{\b\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs52\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports }3\par \pard\plain \s2\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel1\adjustright \b\fs28\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Lady ruggers end successful season}\par \pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\scaps\cf1 Lindsay Morris}{\line }{\caps\fs16 Staff writer}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\adjustright \f62\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 With the final record of 5-1, the Bowdoin Women\rquote s Rugby  team couldn\rquote t be happier at the close of this season. With a strong win against Northeastern, the lady ruggers finished the season the power and confidence they displayed this entire year. Bowdoin ruggers showed talent as well as class as they ignored negative attitudes from Northeastern players on the field. The 36-10 victory is an example of the ability, skill and potential this team reached at the end of the season.\par Two weeks ago, the women lost a crucial game to Wellesey (52-7). The biggest matchup of the season, the ruggers prepared thoroughly for the game. However, despite the effort and aggression displayed on the field, the ruggers could not defeat Wellesey. With this one loss, Bowdoin ended up placing fourth overall in division 2 of NERFU (New England Rugby Football Union). Coaches and teammates alike found the challenge of the match motivation to work and improve for next season.\par Highly encouraging for the lady ruggers was the incredible B-side pack which won a majority of their games. Many first-years displayed determination and strength in their matches, and by the end of the season a real improvement by the new players working together as a team was visible. \par Sophomore Elie Doig said of the rookie players, \ldblquote As far as the season goes, I don\rquote t think it could\rquote ve gone better. To go from 0-5 last year to 5-1 this season is great, but that doesn\rquote t even show how incredibly strong this team is and continues to become. We\rquote ve had so many new people join who have become some of the most enthusiastic members of the team. \par So many rookies picked up the game like they had been playing it for years, too! I think that\rquote s a major strength of the team\emdash the fact that so many people learned so much about rugby this season, which was obvious in watching any of the games. With the enthusiasm of this team, the wonderful coaching that we are lucky enough to have, and the incredible sense of togetherness that exists between us, there is no doubt that we will continue to learn and strengthen as a team.\rdblquote \par The strength of the rookie players was a direct result of a team of skilled and supportive upperclassmen, ready and willing to share their knowledge about the game to the new players. First-year, Eileen Sock put it this way, \ldblquote As a rookie, we could not have had better athletic and personal role models than the upper class rugby players. Seniors and playes going abroad will be sorely missed, but their tremendous leadership this season has made a mark that we can live up to in the future.\rdblquote \par The Bowdoin Rugby players are not gone for the rest of the year, however, they look forward to more practice, improvement, and playing in the spring season, with a possible tour to Europe as well.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Lady ruggers end successful season}}}{\b\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs52\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports }4\par \pard\plain \s2\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel1\adjustright \b\fs28\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 NASCAR: The scent of America}\par \pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\scaps\cf1 Seth Barnes}{\line }{\caps\fs16 Contributor}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\adjustright \f62\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\fs16\cf0 Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to tell you about a spectacle of speed and power that will make you break into a frantic sweat, make your heart race, and quite possibly send you reeling to the ground drenched in your own tears of joy. I am going to tell you about love, and the heights that the human spirit can ascend to. I am going to tell you about the finest automotive machines ever crafted by human hands. I\rquote m going to tell you how I grew from boy into a man. And how I grew from a man into a savage ape. And if all goes according to plan, I\rquote m going to give you a small taste of America\rquote s greatest innovation: unabated NASCAR racing.\par Thirty-seven weekends a year, a band of warriors climb into their iron chariots and risk their lives in pursuit of the Winston Cup Championship. Are these mortal men, or are they Gods? Could there be a world devoid of stock car racing? Would anybody in their right mind choose to live in such a world? I think not. \par Maybe you knew that a mere 130 miles west of Bowdoin there exists a super speedway that attracts legions of crazed individuals each weekend. Maybe you didn\rquote t. The fact remains that in the tiny hamlet of Loudon, New Hampshire, the Mecca known as the New Hampshire International Speedway (NHIS) stands as a monument that draws the likes of kings, the likes of paupers, the likes of race fans. I will speak earnestly with you my friends, for I know of no other mode of operation. \par On a warm fall weekend in early September I made a journey to NHIS with six of my fellow comrades (seniors all of us, poised to take on the new challenges of the Winston Cup as we had tackled and overcome all that had met us in our illustrious Bowdoin careers) to watch the Dura Lube 300. \par The men who eventually left that raceway were enlightened beings who swam in exhilaration and touched the face of a new God. They were also primal beasts, bereft of any semblance of integrity, ethical action, or the basic abilities of maintaining an acceptable level of personal hygiene. Beasts who stalked a prey of grilled meats, sparkling transmissions, and motor oil. How did this all happen?\tab \par We began our journey in a 27-foot extravaganza know as The California Flyer. As motor homes go this piece of machinery was a gem. Inside, she provided every imaginable amenity one could expect from a motor home; outside, her smooth, sexy shape cut through the New Hampshire air like a the slingshot pellets I played with as a boy. She was captained by William Golding, the man who had arranged for the rental of the R.V. Golding directed us to a shopping megaplex in Concord N.H. where we loaded up with all the necessities for the weekend...namely pounds of uncooked meat, charcoal, potato chips, playing cards, and macro brews. \par Let me say a word about beer consumption at a NASCAR race. Leave your German Oatmeal Stouts, and Honey Dew Drop Raspberry Porters at home. Race officials enforce a strict code that calls for the ejection of any mongrel who isn\rquote t drinking a beer that is light in body and slight on taste. Also, every beverage must have a thick Styrofoam blanket surrounding it known as a \ldblquote Coo-Zee\rdblquote  to keep it freezing delicious. \par The belly of The Flyer filled to its brim, we came upon the gates of the speedway, and got in line to find our campsite. The scene outside was delirious with activity. Husbands hoisted wives up on their shoulders and danced to country music. Bonfires raged and roared, that were barely in control. People slapped each other on the back, high fived, and smoked cigarettes like it was the last day on earth. And this was just at the entrance. \par As we snaked our way through the grounds fighting the traffic, members of the NASCAR cult would enter The Flyer from time to time to give us the warmest of welcomes. Most of these people were men named Randy who sported WWF t-shirts, gold chains, and serpent tattoos on either arm. Finally the wait was over and our campsite loomed on the horizon. It\rquote s name was ominous and telling: The Jungle.\tab \par The Jungle is on the outskirts of the campground at NHIS. It is where they put fans who crave lawless destruction and excess. It is not a place for the politically correct or morally righteous. Along the main roadway of the campground, a group of men yelled at the passing vehicles to \ldblquote Light \lquote em up\rdblquote  (obviously meaning they wanted the drivers to spin their tires at a high rate of speed) and encouraged women to remove their shirts and bare their naked breasts. We had entered the den of the angry white male.\par Because we were unable to fulfil either of these requests, we parked our camper and disembarked timidly. Would we be swallowed by this mass of testosterone and inappropriate remarks? What would our mothers think? \par Luckily one of our troops called us into action. Wendell Simonson III screamed, \ldblquote We\rquote re not any different. We\rquote ve just got to connect with these people! It\rquote s like a tomato bush trying to grow in a corn field...it\rquote s not going to flower unless it reaches for the sun!\rdblquote  \par Fine words Wendell, fine words my boy. In hours we had met our neighbors and been accepted as part of the clan. One of my friends, Christopher \ldblquote Kitty\rdblquote  Hughes even got into a spirited game of horseshoes that went well into the night, and only ended when his new friend Rocko was struck in the jaw by an errant toss. We couldn\rquote t believe our good fortune. We, awkward college students from the suburbs were making nice with the heartland of America. It was beautiful. Although I had to lay down in The Flyer for a spell because of a digestive mishap I encountered on my seventh hot dog, the party roared through the night.\par The man who piloted the camper next to us became one of our closest pals. His name was Jim and he spoke in a broken dialect peppered with F-bombs. He himself actually worked on a pit crew at a smaller racetrack in New York, and educated us in on the ins and outs of racing. Never have I met a man so full of good cheer and self depreciating humor. On one occasion he even filled us in on how to tip over an occupied porta potty.  Although Jim was not the world\rquote s most handsome man (he was missing all but three teeth on his upper gum line), he certainly had a pipeline to the heart of womankind. He demonstrated this to us first with a story about his escapades with a certain striper from Providence, and then with suggestive catcalls to several women who passed by. How they resisted his advances is a mystery to this day. \par The night ended with us going to a massive rock concert sponsored by Winston. Above the stage, an awestriking banner screamed \ldblquote Welcome Home! Nobody leaves a stranger!\rdblquote  \par On stage a massive man with a shaved head screamed to the chorus of outrageous guitar rhythms. And at the end of every song, he screamed at the assembled multitude \ldblquote You Suck!!!\rdblquote . The audience roared in approval. We did suck! \par The band wrapped up the night with its signature tune, \ldblquote If You Play Another Country Song I\rquote m Gonna Have To Kick Your Ass\rdblquote  and we all headed back to the campsite. We set our alarms extra early, allowing us time to wake up, go for a jog, and collect recyclables around the campsite. As we nestled into bed, into our Flyer, my friend Jack Glynn summed it up perfectly, muttering \ldblquote America Rules, Dude.\rdblquote  as he drifted off. We were at the height of ecstasy, but already we were losing our powers of rational thought.\par As we awoke on the morning of the race, our outlook on the world had changed drastically. Samuel \ldblquote Eye Wash Boy\rdblquote  Margolis tried to sneak into the bathroom to take a shower. No such luck buster. He was met with resistance by several members of our entourage who felt that showering was for \ldblquote sissies\rdblquote  or \ldblquote softies.\rdblquote  \par No member of the Flyer team was going to embarrass the rest of the group by sporting a freshly washed shock of hair, or smelling clean and beautiful. Somebody gathered all the toothbrushes in the camper and threw them in a pile outside; soon they were ablaze in a glorious plume of orange destruction. \par Even though it was only 10:00 we huddled around the grill and cooked strips of raw meat, drooling and grunting like demented wolves, drunk with anticipation at the thought of tearing the prey into unrecognizable pieces. Alexander \ldblquote Keats\rdblquote  Ellis ran into a nearby wood with a hunk of cooked animal meat. What happened there is between him and the pair New Hampshire State Troopers who were forced to confront the ghastly scene. For the rest of us, the hour of the race was approaching.\tab \par A cornerstone of the NASCAR experience is grounded in the fact that each race fan has one driver that they root for throughout the season, throughout their lives, maybe even after death. For us, this driver is a man named Ricky Rudd, a veteran of the circuit who is lauded for his dignity and bravery on the track. Several times Rudd has been flipped over on the track, - sent in a spiral of flames against the outer embankment. Each time he has emerged even more determined and focused. \par As we walked to the gates of the facility we linked arms with other devotees of the noble #28 car. Each member of the sect was draped from head to toe in a wild array of Ricky Rudd paraphernalia...I\rquote ll tell you right now my friends that blanketing yourself in the race colors of your favorite driver is indescribable. It is as close as I have come to unabashed love; Rudd is not only a hero, he is a father figure to millions. \par Inside the track, we made our way to our seats, each pair of eyes fixed on our beloved Rudd as he started his engine and began to speed around the track. The race was underway. I can hardly recall what happened in the next three hours. I guess the reason for this was the intensity of the engines, and the fact that we had ascended to a place where individual thought gave way to one collective mind that rose above the speedway and contemplated all that was good and true.On one of many trips to the restroom I spotted a middle-aged man sobbing next to the snack bar. He was sporting a dizzying kaleidoscope of race gear supporting Jeff Burton, the driver who eventually won the race. \par The race was nearly over, and although Rudd appeared to have secured a top ten finish, victory was not the name of the day. I was somewhat disappointed, but still giddy about the enlightenment I had obtained. Little did I know that upon my return to Bowdoin several members of The Flyer contingent would be forced to take a leave of absence from the college because of NASCAR related difficulties.\par One member decided to stop going to the dining hall. Instead he fed himself only from the animals that he was able to catch and kill with his own hands. He became sick after ingesting rotten squirrel meat. One member told his girlfriend that he had decided to stop speaking English, and would instead communicate in a series of monkey-like grunts and whistles. She ended the relationship. And in the most tragic case, one member was unable to live outside the walls of NHIS. He decided he was Ricky Rudd himself, and interrupted countless lectures with questions about engine temperature and steering columns. \par We had gone too far. But despite our losses I will remember for the rest of my days, what the man by the snack bar said to me.  Tears running down his face, beer belly trembling, thick black beard dirtied with a bright orange sauce, he grabbed me by the forearm, looked me in the eyes, and gasped, \ldblquote These are the best damn nachos I\rquote ve ever had. God bless this place. God bless us all!!\rdblquote   \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\fs28 \par \par }{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 NASCAR: The scent of America}}}{\b\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs52\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports }5\par \pard\plain \s2\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel1\adjustright \b\fs28\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Bad News Bears: Football goes 0-8}\par \pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\scaps\cf1 J.P.

The win also gave the CBB Championship to the Mules as they proved their supremacy over Bates and Bowdoin this season.\par Bowdoin linebacker, Sean Lannigan \lquote 01, sparked his team early in the first quarter. He intercepted a Pat Conley pass and ran it back 55 yards for a Polar Bear touchdown and a 7-0 lead.  \par However, the momentum quickly turned as Colby rattled off 34 unanswered points. With 5:58 left in the first, Conley connected with Don Williams for a 5-yard TD pass to tie up the contest. Rashad Lewis upped the lead as he ripped through the Polar Bears\rquote  defense for a 22-yard touchdown. Colby then connected on a field goal with only 46 seconds left in the half for a 17-7 lead.\par   The second half belonged to the Mules as well. Kicker Keith Jonassen split the upright from 37 yards and RB Danny Noyes rushed for two scores to hand Bowdoin its eighth loss of the season by a score of 34-7.  The Mules dominated statistically the game as they tallied 26 first-downs compared to only eight for Bowdoin. Colby also won the time of possession battle by 15 minutes and amassed 179 yards rushing and 261 yards passing. Conversely, Bowdoin gained 62 net yards on the ground and 57 through the air. Co-captain Tim Lawson \lquote 01 finished his Bowdoin career with 41 yards on 11 carries. Mike Taylor \lquote 02 carried the bulk of the load, running for 48 yards on 13 carries.\par   Before the season started, head coach Dave Caputi talked about building upon \ldblquote small victories\rdblquote  in order for his team to be successful, but did not quantify the Polar Bears goals with respect to wins and losses. Upon reflection, Caputi remarked, \ldblquote I think we had a lot of those little victories early on, but as the season progressed, we were beat up with injuries and lost some of that continuity.\rdblquote   However, the Polar Bear football team featured many young players who played significant minutes and received valuable experience. Youngsters who contributed considerably include tailback Kevin Bougie \lquote 04, quarterback Justin Hardison \lquote 03, wideout Jason Rawlins \lquote 03, as well as others.\par \ldblquote Offensively, we were able to play a lot of young kids even though some of them may have been a little over their heads. They lacked the physical maturity as freshman or sophomores that other kids who have been in the weight room for three years already have. But, they got a taste of what they need to do on the field and in the off-season,\rdblquote  said Caputi.  \par Caputi\rquote s young offensive unit averaged 10.1 points per game while their opponents tallied an average of 29.4. The Polar Bears were also heavily out-rushed throughout the season. Bowdoin\rquote s backfield rushed for 716 yards and seven  TDs with an average of 2.5 yards per carry, but the Polar Bear\rquote s opposition totaled a whopping 1659 yards on the ground with a 4.3 yards per carry average and 17 TDs. Tim Lawson \lquote 01 led the Polar Bear\rquote s rushing attack and gained 304 yards on 71 carries while punching it into the end zone four times. Bougie was the team\rquote s second leading rusher, and used 62 carries to gain 200 yards and score a TD.\par Although Bowdoin fell short of their opponents on the ground, Hardison and backup, Kyle Quinn \rquote 01, combined to throw for more yards than their opponents by a total of 1108 yards to 1000. However, the Polar Bears only passed for two scores while their opponents threw for 12 TDs. In his first year as a starter, Hardison completed 118 out of 217 passes for 1046 yards and two TDs, but also was picked off nine times.\par  Hardison\rquote s favorite target was Jason Rawlins \lquote 03 who caught 29 passes for 312 yards and two TDs. Fellow wideout, Mike Taylor \lquote 02, pulled in 25 passes for 166 yards and was second in the team in all-purpose yards averaging 44.1 yards per game.\par   However, the defensive side of the football will be losing many valuable senior contributors. Senior DB Brian Losier led the Polar Bears in tackles with 67 including seven that went for losses. Nick Krol \lquote 01 made 61 tackles from the linebacker position while his fellow linebacker and co-captain Tom Connelly \lquote 01 made 47 tackles and had two sacks. Linebacker Sean Lannigan \lquote 01 made 50 tackles, including 13 tackles for a loss and three sacks. Another senior defensive stalwart, Shaun Leonardo \lquote 01, tallied 53 tackles throughout the year and had two sacks. However, Travis Cummings \lquote 02 will return next year after making 60 tackles this season and intercepting four passes for 112 yards.  \par Despite losing a fair number of senior defensive players, Caputi and the Polar Bears remain optimistic for next season due to the number of returning players on the offensive side of the ball and the work they plan to put in during the off season. The coaching staff has also been vying for talented recruits in the off season.\par Said Caputi, \ldblquote We are working hard in the recruiting aspect. The coaches have attended over 20 different camps and a lot of players have visited campus. The main thing is that we have let the College sell itself and show the recruits the opportunities they have in the Bowdoin football program.\rdblquote \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\fs28 \par \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs52\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Sports }6{\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Cross country takes 8th at regionals}{\b\fs28 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 Cait Fowkes}{\line }{\caps\fs16 Copy editor}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360\tx10080\tx10800\tx11520\tx12240\tx12960\adjustright \f62\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 The women\rquote s cross country team completed their season last Saturday at the NCAA New England regional meet hosted by UMASS Dartmouth. Bowdoin  finished in eighth place out of the 35 teams that competed. Bowdoin defeated Trinity, Wesleyan, Bates and MIT, amongst others.\par  Of particular note was first year Meredith Godreau\rquote s performance. Her completion of the course in 18:34, a personal best this season, earned her 20th place overall and a spot to compete at nationals. Other notable performances include Co-Captain, Jessica Gray \rquote 01, who finished 36th amongst nearly 300 other runners. Libby Barney \rquote 03 ran a person best time of 19:06 for the season. Kala Hardacker \rquote 04 and Bre-Ann McKenna \rquote 03 ran strong races as well. \par  Earlier in the season, the Bowdoin team ran to a seventh place finish at NESCACs, defeating Colby, Trinity and Bates.  Tufts, who tied with Bowdoin for seventh, hosted the competition.  The course itself was a combination of woods and fields which gave the women an opportunity to run fast times without the challenge of overbearing hills.  Coach Slovenski commented on the course, \ldblquote I think the open and flat courses were good for our team.  We have some good 800 meter track runners, and this will be better for them than hilly courses.\rdblquote \par Godreau  was the top finisher for Bowdoin, running the 5K in 19:49. Hardacker  followed Goudrea,  and Gray  finished just one second behind Hardacker. Barney,  McKenna, Kate Waller \rquote 02, Erin Lyman \rquote 01, Jen Staples \rquote 01, and Annie Blair \rquote 03 all ran competitive races as well. Overall Goudreau finished 22nd in the competition, Hardacker 25th, Gray 26th and Barney 41st.  \par McKenna has been an integral part of the team this season, consistently running in the #5 position.  \ldblquote Bre\rquote s summer training and courage in the races have been a big part of our team\rquote s improvement this season.  She passed two runners on the final straightaway to move us from 8th place into the tie for 7th,\rdblquote  Slovenski remarked.\par  Co-captains Gray  and Erin Lyman \rquote 01 have also been lead runners  for the team. The two have been top runners and top scorers in every race this season. Their talent and enthusiasm are an asset to the team. Godreau and Hardacker have demonstrated their prowess, particularly towards the end of the season after overcoming high school injuries. \par  These two first years led the team at NESCACs  and will continue to be a  dominant force in the distance events during indoor track season. The team\rquote s strong season was also a result of the efforts of Waller, Jen Staples and Blair. These runners consistently ran competitive times and finished amongst the top scorers for the team.\par  Ultimately, the women\rquote s cross country Team ran a strong season due to the  depth of the talent of the team. The last runner for Bowdoin generally finished the race within 20-30 seconds of our lead runner. It was this depth that enabled the women to race together effectively and push one another to personal best performances.\par  The season will officially end after nationals. This race will be held on November18 in Spokane, Washington. Good luck Meredith and good job Bears  on a strong cross country season.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Cross country takes 8th at regionals}}}{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Bad News Bears: Football goes 0-8}}}{\b\fs28 \par }{\fs94 \par }{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \v\f4\cgrid {\tc {\v }{\v\fs94 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Cross country fails in bid for nationals}}}{\fs52 \par }}
