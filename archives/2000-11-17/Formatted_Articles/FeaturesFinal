June 1863 saw the desperation of the Confederacy and the frustration of the Union. On the western front, Ulysses S. Grant clung on to the river town of Vicksburg, Mississippi, and all through the South, the death of Stonewall Jackson, a month earlier, was still being mourned. \par In the North, recent disasters on the eastern front were not greeted well. Anxiously, the Lincoln Administration pushed for something to be done about the seemingly invincible rebel Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee.\par The Union Army of the Potomac commander General Joseph Hooker, opposing Lee, had seen his splendid plan to crush Lee fail in the tangled mess of the Wilderness at the beginning of May and now seemed not to have a clue as to what to do next. \par While Hooker\rquote s reputation suffered from the disastrous Battle of Chancellorsville, his subordinate, Oliver Howard, Commander of the Federal Eleventh Corps suffered even more. His reputation had been crushed by Jackson\rquote s surprise flank attack. His corps, comprised mostly of German units, also lost their already sketchy standing in the army ranks. \par Still, Howard was never censured and no charges were ever pressed. There was room for forgiveness. There was also room for making up for his mistakes, and Howard intended to prove his fighting skill once and for all. He would soon get his chance.\par In June, Robert E. Lee marched with his rebel army around the right flank of the Army of the Potomac to begin his second invasion of the north. He hoped to move fast enough so that his presence on enemy soil could scare the Lincoln Administration to beg for peace. \par Late in June, the Army of the Potomac marched from its camp on the Rappahannock River to pursue. Massive controversy over authority caused Hooker to be replaced with Major General George G. Meade. Meanwhile, elements of the Union Army were entering Pennsylvania in pursuit of Lee\rquote s scattered commands. \par At the crossroads town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Union General John Buford\rquote s cavalry division ran into elements of Confederate General Henry Heth\rquote s infantry division. Heth had sent his men into Gettysburg, not for a fight, but to acquire some much-needed shoes. It was June 30.\par That night, Howard was dining with his wing commander, Major General John F. Reynolds, at a farmhouse between Gettysburg and the town of Emmitsburg. Earlier that month, as the Federal troops began to cross back onto northern soil, Howard had received a letter from Maine, asking him if he would accept a nomination to run for governor. \par Howard had never entered politics, and undoubtedly he felt that he had a score to settle with the rebels under Lee. Despite urges from loyal supporters, Howard turned down the offer and focussed on reclaiming his corps\rquote s tarnished name. \par That night, Howard and Reynolds awaited new orders from Meade. Nothing came, and Reynolds left. It was the last time Howard would see Reynolds again. \par On the morning of July 1, 1863, General Heth\rquote s division advanced down the Chambersburg Pike towards Gettysburg, intending to brush aside resistance, which Heth concluded, was militia. \par John Buford\rquote s cavalrymen gave the rebels a rough handling and the infantry ran back to Heth, confused and dazed. Again the rebels came, and Buford sent word to John Reynolds that he needed support or he could not hold.\par Reynolds, one of the best commanders the North had, soon arrived on the field and summoned the three corps under his command to move on Gettysburg. His troops were the superb First Corps, Howard\rquote s Eleventh Corps, and Dan Sickle\rquote s Third Corps. \par His first division under General James Wadsworth came into line. The troops were the famed Iron Brigade. The \ldblquote Black Hats\rdblquote \emdash they were referred to in this name thanks to the black felt hats that became their symbol during the War\emdash struck Heth\rquote s tired troops and sent them running. \par But more Confederate troops were moving in. By now, Lee had seen the danger of his exposed command and ordered a concentration at Gettysburg. General Richard Ewell\rquote s Second Corps was to enter the crossroads town from the north while General A. P. Hill\rquote s Third Corps was to hammer its way in from the West. \par Hill, Heth\rquote s corps commander, ordered his entire command forward, and soon the Federal troops had their hands full. It was during this morning action that General Reynolds lost his life. He was struck by a sniper\rquote s bullet.\par Command of the field was suddenly passed to Howard, as the senior major general on the field. Howard, no doubt stunned by the sudden expansion of his responsibilities, told the First Corps to hold the northwest section of Gettysburg while his own men went into position towards the north of town. \par Howard placed his corps under General Carl Schurz, and ordered one division, under General Adolph von Steinwehr, to hold Cemetery Hill, a natural place of considerable strength to the south of Gettysburg. \par The other two divisions under Schurz were hurried towards the north to receive an attack from General Richard Ewell\rquote s rebel command. Howard remained on Cemetery Hill, watching the afternoon action, and further ordering the placement of Union cannon on the Hill.\par The fighting became intense. The First Corps held beautifully against A.P. Hill\rquote s savage assaults to the west, despite heavy losses. To the north, Howard\rquote s line was not doing so well. Struck hard by reinforced Confederate divisions, the Federal troopers broke and ran for the protection of their guns south of town. \par Overwhelming numbers had routed the Germans and many of them got lost in the streets of Gettysburg, to be captured later when the rebels entered the town. One Union general, Alexander Schimmelfennig, hid in a pigpen during the next three days, which were to mark the heaviest fighting on the North American continent. \par After the rout of the Eleventh Corps, the First Corps could no longer maintain its position and also fell back to Cemetery Hill where Howard tried to rally the men from both corps. It was the timely arrival of Major General Winfield Scott Hancock, a much loved commander, that saved the day. \par Hancock\rquote s presence on the field stemmed the tide of retreat but also upset Howard, who outranked the newly arrived general. Hancock had orders from General Meade to take command of the field, but Howard felt that he was being undermined.\par Whether Howard\rquote s actions helped anything on the first day of Gettysburg is still a matter of controversy. The command of the Federal wing was suddenly thrust upon him after Reynolds\rquote s death. Howard may have intended to fight a holding action, as Reynolds had, while awaiting the reinforcements from Meade. \par He was, however, overwhelmed by numbers and determination. His poor showing at Chancellorsville may have also caused his lack of respect among the retreating men while Hancock\rquote s mere sight caused the men to stand at their posts.\par The next day saw the concentration of both armies and Lee\rquote s attack on both flanks. On the right, where Howard\rquote s line was, Lee\rquote s attack was forced back after some heavy fighting while on the extreme left, a little known professor from Bowdoin named Joshua Chamberlain saved the day, and possibly the Union. \par That night, Meade posed a question to his corps commanders. Should they stay, retreat, or attack? Howard was in favor of an attack late the next afternoon, but the third day of Gettysburg saw Pickett\rquote s ill-fated assault, and after its carnage, neither commanders had the will for another attack. \par The Battle of Gettysburg had ended, and Howard had come no where close to regaining his pre-Chancellorsville reputation.\par To Be Continued\u8230\'c9\par Next Time: To The West.\par Sources Used:\par 1.

The unmistakable jingle of copper and silver created a slight, yet undeniable drone on our fair campus last Friday. Across the quad, through hallways, in the classroom, the clinking came from every khaki-pants pocket on its way to Smith Union. In the Union, the slight clinking became a roaring waterfall of change at the Up \lquote til Dawn table, the epicenter of the Penny Wars competition. Add to this flow of coins the sweet aroma of a good, old-fashioned bakesale, and you\rquote ve got yourself one heck of a fundraiser.\par Penny Wars provided an excellent forum for students to act upon their affinity or seething hatred toward any particular social house. The penny jars elicited such a response that extra buckets had to be put out to hold the swelling collections. A palpable tension hung in the air as students anxiously wondered whether their pennies would truly make a difference. Earlier exit polls had shown the contest was to be a tight one, but no one was prepared for the mayhem that would ensue during the counting process.\par After finally ending the collection period, the Up \lquote til Dawn team began the laborious counting process. Chief Counting Officer Erica Bellamy \rquote 03 had confidence in a rapid, accurate count and said, \ldblquote We\rquote re going to stick to the basics: pennies are one cent, nickels are five, dimes ten, and quarters twenty-five. Nothing fuzzy about that math.\rdblquote  Alas, predictions have an uncanny ability to turn out false.\par Problems arose as long nights of coin-counting began to take their toll on the counters. \ldblquote My fingers hurt,\rdblquote  whined Assistant Nickel Director Alex Duncan \lquote 03. Working in shifts, counters alternated from feverishly sorting and counting to resting and icing their weary fingers. Speculation surfaced, suggesting that these weakened fingers may have compromised the accuracy of the counters. Nonetheless, the selfless counters forged on, jar after jar.\par Problems continued with reports of irate students, who contended that the jar layout was too confusing to be followed. Said potentially disenfranchised donor Ryan Q. \lquote 03, \ldblquote I set out to put my pennies in the Boody Street jar, which I believe is a very strong house. Afterward, I was dismayed to find I had dropped them in Pat Buchanan\rquote s jar!\rdblquote  \par When the interviewer pointed out that there was no jar for Pat Buchanan, Ryan quickly changed the subject and eventually ran away, throwing doubt on the legitimacy of his accusations.\par Amid the controversy, the Up \lquote til Dawn counting committee declined to declare a winner, and launched an extensive hand recount. They hope to be finished with the count by next week.\par Although Penny Wars generated much debate, everyone agreed the bakesale was a true winner, raising an estimated $175. Brownies, cookies, cheesecake, and pies dazzled the eye and thrilled the tongue. While each dish was a marvel in baking achievement, the blue ribbon went to Kara Podkaminer \lquote 03 who knocked the secret panel of judges for a loop with her chocolate pecan pie. \par \ldblquote It was like a culinary alley-oop,\rdblquote  an unnamed judge reported. \ldblquote The pecans lobbed my tongue up, and then the chocolate slammed it down. I\rquote m not afraid to say it hit the spot.\rdblquote \par The Up \lquote til Dawn team reminds students that all proceeds from Penny Wars and the bakesale go toward St. Jude\rquote s Children\rquote s Research Hospital, which performs vital research on childhood illnesses. The team also encourages all to look for other Up \lquote til Dawn fundraisers throughout the year.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Penny Wars winner still undecided}}}{\b\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \f4\fs48\cgrid {Features 3\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Letter from London: European transportation}{\b\fs28 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 James Fisher}{\b\scaps \par }{\caps\fs16 staff writer}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\adjustright \f21\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 LONDON\emdash Readers with a good memory and nothing better to fill it with will recall that several weeks ago I spent a week and a half not in London but in Italy. Well, I\rquote m back, with a tan (barely) and a newfound appreciation for really small motorized vehicles. \par Scooters of any shape or form are cause for public humiliation in America. (I\rquote m not talking about the Sharper Image, retro-style scooter here\emdash which }{\i\cf0 should}{\cf0  be embarrassing to use\emdash but \ldblquote scooter\rdblquote  in the sense of an underfunded motorcycle.) Lincoln Navigators have no patience for mosquito-like scooters zipping in and out of lanes. \par In London, scooters are a little more accepted, but bonafide motorcycles are more popular, and the climate is a strong argument for a vehicle with a roof. \par The Smart car\emdash designed in part by Swatch\emdash is a good compromise here. It\rquote s eight feet long, skinnier than a normal car, has two seats, and looks like an iMac on wheels.\par Italians, however, prefer scooters. There are easily as many of them in Rome as there are cars (and, incidentally, good luck finding any cars bigger than a Ford Taurus). They run around everywhere. You see all kinds\emdash Vespas that must have been on sale when Mussolini was in power, cute little pink Hondas and dangerous-looking BMWs. \par In general, traffic is pretty patient in dealing with scooters, in a way that Americans would find hard to accept. Lanes in the States are treated like electrically charged barriers; changing lanes is a big deal, and new drivers are told to plan lane changes blocks in advance. \par But all over Europe, and especially in Italy, traffic lanes are mere suggestions, and often ignored. Scooters are great at this! A traffic jam, to an Italian on a scooter, is not a barrier but an intriguing obstacle course. Sidewalks are not out of bounds in this situation. \par In spite of this, Italy was a more relaxing place to be a pedestrian than London. Rome is certainly less dense, in terms of buildings and people. \par There are almost no public advertisements anywhere in Rome, Florence, or Venice\emdash no billboards, no ads draping over the sides of buildings, few advertisements on taxis or buses. \par No one stands on the street corner shoving flyers into your torso; fewer newsstands have signs saying \ldblquote COPS NAB NUN IN TOT STAB,\rdblquote  \ldblquote BLAIR CALLS BECKS NINCOMPOOP\rdblquote  or something similarly controversial and confusing. \par I think Italy runs at a slower pace because its public spaces have less offensive and annoying stuff to hurry away from than in London.\par We did eat well in Italy. No surprise there. The pizzas are almost impossibly thin, practically on saltine-size crusts, but usually tasty. I recommend eggplant. One of us, Paul, made it a point to eat at least one pizza a day, at lunch or dinner. Meals were lavish: the four of us usually spent over\emdash gasp\emdash 100,000 lire! \par You\rquote d have to be a millionaire in Italy to be anywhere over the poverty line! True\emdash and a dollar equals about 2,000 lire. I think. Anyway it\rquote s some ridiculous exchange rate like that. \par One of our days in Rome was devoted to Pompeii. We took the train (Italy, like most European countries, has a large and cheap rail network) to Naples and looked around the train station for a bus to Pompeii. I went off to the change bureau for a couple hundred thou and came back to find Dave, Chase, and Paul standing next to an old Italian guy straight out of }{\i\cf0 The Godfather}{\cf0 . \par Mario, who had a business card and a Mercedes, was offering to be our personal chauffeur for the day\emdash to Pompeii and back\emdash for about 20 bucks each. \par Oh, why not? And it turned out great. It was definitely not the first time Mario had encountered American tourists en route to Pompeii. \par Along the highway we got a running commentary\emdash \ldblquote Vesuvius there. Other mountain next to Vesuvius there.\rdblquote  \par Once at Pompeii, we parked next to a caf\u233\'8e across the street. \par Mario said, in effect, see you later\emdash I\rquote ll be here. He settled down with his friends, cracked a bottle of wine, and smiled. So we went in and saw Pompeii, came out almost four hours later, and Mario was still there. Thoughtfully he had reserved us a table at the caf\u233\'8e for lunch. I think his aunt ran the place.\par We asked him to drop us off at a museum in Naples, on the other side of town than the train station, and he did, advising us to \ldblquote take the subway back.\rdblquote  Subway? Naples is maybe half the size of Portland; what does it need a subway for? He must mean a trolley or something. \par But, in fact, Naples has a subway system. Two lines; maybe 15 stops. It is definitely a more relaxed system than London\rquote s Tube. Tickets are sold but unnecessary, since there aren\rquote t any turnstiles to jump; the honor system is augmented by infrequent, random ticket checks on the trains, but we never saw anyone do this. Getting lost would be hard, since there\rquote s only one platform to go to. \par The Italian commitment to public transportation reaches its apex, however, in Venice. This city doesn\rquote t even have roads, and half of it is underwater. No subway here. Once again, the train station was far from where our hotel was, and even by Italian price standards a water taxi would be expensive. \par The solution: a floating subway system. Pubic boats run on about ten different lines all over Venice\rquote s main islands. Tickets are cheap, the honor system remains in place, and one line even runs all night\emdash which you can\rquote t say for the Tube. \par So I think the Bowdoin area would benefit from an underground transportation system. It would ease the parking problems and make a shuttle unnecessary. Put one stop in the middle of the quad; another out by the athletic fields; another by Shop \lquote n\rquote  Save; and one satellite station next to Wal-Mart. Have it run by computer 24 hours a day, and just for the heck of it, make it free. What\rquote s an endowment for, anyway?\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Letter from London: European transportation}}}{\b\fs28 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \f4\fs48\cgrid {Features}{ }{4\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\b\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Two Years Beneath the Pines: Post-electoral blues}{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \b\v\f4\fs28\cgrid {\tc {\b\v\fs28 }{\b\v\fs28 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Two Years Beneath the Pines: Post-electoral blues}}}{\b\scaps\fs28\cf1 \par }{\b\scaps\cf1 Ludwig Rang}{\b\scaps \par }{\caps\fs16 alumnus\line contributor}{\caps\fs16 \par \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\adjustright \f21\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 LONDON\emdash Prompted by recent events, not on the collegiate but the electoral college front, we will today fast-forward this series to the author\rquote s second year Beneath the Pines, 1956-1957. On the }{\i\cf0 First}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 Tuesday in November }{\cf0 (see title of previous installment) of 1956, that year\rquote s Presidential election took place. \par The contenders were Adlai E. Stevenson, Democrat, the unsuccessful candidate for president four years prior, and Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, the incumbent President. \par Even though it was the common consent that the loser of 1952 didn\rquote t stand a chance against a popular president in 1956, I became an ardent Stevenson fan. \par This was partly due to a general political re-orientation as I grew older\emdash in line with Churchill\rquote s famous saying, that if you\rquote re not a conservative at twenty, you\rquote ve got no brains, and if not a liberal at thirty, no heart. But it was also partly to the more liberal outlook of some of the friends that I made in my second year at Bowdoin. \par Chief among these was my off-campus roommate Edward Podvoll, a New York doctor\rquote s son, with whom I shared rooms on the top floor of an old clapboard house on Union Street, whose landlady appropriately enough was a Mrs. Lincoln. \par Ed had the large room in front, I a smaller one in back, with a sloping ceiling and a dormer window, from which I could see \ldblquote Jancy,\rdblquote  the Wylis jeep I\rquote d inherited from Big Brother Bill that was parked down below. \par Bill, who was married by now and living with his wife Nancy in married quarters, was driving himself and her around in a brand-new Mercedes 200 that his adoptive mother, old Nellie (see }{\i\cf0 Most}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 Unforgettable}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 Character}{\cf0  September 29,2000), had given them as a belated wedding present, after first having me, the Best Man, chauffeur her around Europe in it. \par Picking it up for her at the factory in Sindelfingen near Stuttgart made me feel a bit like an impostor, for in those days, though it was only a medium-sized model, it was the sort of car Captains of Industry, busily creating Germany\rquote s post-war Economic Miracle, were seen to be driving. \par I was so nervous it was a wonder I didn\rquote t wreck it before picking up its owner who was  flying in from L.A., at Frankfurt Airport. \par Ed had no car and was a bit envious, I think. But he had a great collection of classical LP\rquote s he let me listen to, and lots of books he let me borrow, or liked to talk to me about. Two of his favorite authors were Erich Fromm and Reinhold Niebuhr, both sixties intellectual icons. \par He also liked Martin Buber, the great Jewish religious philosopher, and was amazed to hear that my grandfather, a writer on literary and philosophical subjects, had been a friend of Buber. \par Ed also was very fond of poetry, particularly that of T.S. Eliot, some of which he knew by heart. Among his favorite lines, from }{\i\cf0 Prufrock, }{\cf0 were: }{\i\cf0 Do}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 I}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 dare eat a peach/Roll up my trousers on the beach}{\cf0 , mock-seriously recited by Ed in the sonorous tones of the author himself, reading from his works on a recording. \par One of his favorite pieces of music, Caesar Franck\rquote s D-Minor Symphony, new to me, weaned on Beethoven. We would sit up until late listening to music, or talking about everything under the sun, except one thing\emdash  the Holocaust, as it was not yet called, which was, in those days, a taboo subject still, at least between Jews and Germans. \par Not surprisingly, being a bit of an \ldblquote egg head,\rdblquote  Ed too was a Stevenson fan, and, like myself, was fervently hoping Adlai would, this time around, beat Ike, a president he said who read nothing but }{\i\cf0 The}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 Reader\rquote s}{\cf0  }{\i\cf0 Digest}{\cf0 , and felt more at home on the golf course than in the Oval Office. \par Anyhow, the fact that Stevenson didn\rquote t really stand a chance was lost on me, a hapless victim of my own wishful thinking. \par And I was totally ignorant of how American politics really worked, namely in maddening conformity with what Henry Adams (already quoted) called \ldblquote the shifting sands of American public opinion,\rdblquote  of which we have had such a good demonstration only recently. \par So naively confident was I that Stevenson would win, I started betting on the outcome, one dollar, with anyone willing to take me on. This must have been, in view of polls predicting another Republican landslide, almost the whole fraternity. Fortunately, when the time came to collect their debts, most decided to let me off the hook by pretending it had all been a joke. \par This taught me a great lesson, and I have never bet on anything since, except once, quite recently, on the result of the European soccer cup final, France vs. Italy, which I correctly predicted France would win. (However, the winning goal wasn\rquote t scored until extra time, for which eventuality I wasn\rquote t covered. That taught me another lesson: read the fine print.) \par Naturally, I was devastated when Stevenson lost. \par Having stayed up all night with Ed, listening to the results and commentaries on the radio, I suggested, when dawn broke, that we take \ldblquote Jancy\rdblquote  and drive to the nearest beach to take a long walk. \par It was rather chilly of course, and though we would certainly have dared, we didn\rquote t roll up our trousers, nor did we eat a peach, as we hadn\rquote t gotten any. \par We didn\rquote t talk much either\emdash just walked in silence, with a strong wind off the ocean in our tired faces, blowing mental cobwebs away, and helping ameliorate post-electoral blues. \par All the while something kept going through my mind that Stevenson, after conceding, had said to a reporter. Asked how he felt after losing a second time, Adlai, in typical fashion, had quipped, \ldblquote like a little boy who\rquote s stubbed his toe in the dark, but is too old to cry.\rdblquote  \par That was exactly how we felt, and as millions will feel\emdash unless a miracle happens\emdash this year when the recount in Florida is finally announced to a world no longer holding its breath, but wondering if American democracy isn\rquote t in danger of sinking in the \ldblquote shifting sands of public opinion,\rdblquote  along with its archaic election laws and dubious vote-counting procedures, as in a quicksand. \par By the time you read this we may at least have a correct figure. \par Whether or not the damage done to the electoral process by all this confusion, inefficiency, and the sheer injustice of having invalidated on technical grounds thousands of votes cast in good faith in an election this close can ever be repaired is another question. \par Meanwhile, next week, back to the fifties: twentieth-century America\rquote s Golden Age in comparison with the present one, unprecedentedly prosperous, yet so uncertain.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\par \par }}
