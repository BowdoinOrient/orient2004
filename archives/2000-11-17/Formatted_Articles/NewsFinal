His speech started with a brief history of how he ended up at Bowdoin and his first impressions of the College. \par Unlike most of his classmates at a private high school in Virginia, Druckenmiller chose to look beyond the University of Virginia, and decided to attend Bowdoin on the advice of an English teacher. He described his arrival at Bowdoin as a \ldblquote profound culture shock\rdblquote  to a self-proclaimed \ldblquote hick from Virginia.\rdblquote  \par He emphasized the benefits he gained from learning to take risks while at Bowdoin. \par \ldblquote The key to my Bowdoin experience was I ventured outside my comfort zone in both the curriculum as well as the personal.\rdblquote  \par He originally wanted to be an English professor, but after taking an introductory economics course during his junior year, he decided to double major in English and economics. \par Druckenmiller stressed how much he learned from the wide variety of friendships that he cultivated at Bowdoin, saying, \ldblquote I milked the diversity of the student body for all it was worth.\rdblquote  \par He described experiences such as visiting a rough section of New York with a Latino friend and visiting a gay bar in Portland with a homosexual as critical learning experiences. His group of friends included people from all racial backgrounds, socioeconomic levels, and political schools of thought and interests. \par Druckenmiller then spoke about Bowdoin\rquote s contribution to his success in the financial world. \par He said that he believes that the fact that he never took a business course actually helped him, saying, \ldblquote There are no specific facts I learned in any classes that I drew upon subsequently to enhance my performance in navigating the financial markets\u8230\'c9.\par \ldblquote The markets have changed so dramatically over the 25 years that any \lquote answer\rquote  I might have learned may have resulted in an inflexibility or a lack of open mindedness to change that could have been disastrous.\rdblquote  \par He said that his liberal arts education taught him the critical thinking and problem solving skills and the openness to new ideas necessary to keep one step ahead of the financial markets\rquote  fluctuations. \par \ldblquote Anticipation of change is the number one ingredient to success in the financial markets.\rdblquote  \par After dropping out of a Ph.D. program in economics at University of Michigan, Druckenmiller began his career on Wall Street on the advice that he shouldn\rquote t expect to get rich but that he would \ldblquote love the intellectual stimulation.\rdblquote  \par At the age of 26, he became the youngest vice president in the history of the Pittsburgh National Bank. After one year of managing their $6 billion Trust Department, he decided to start his own investment firm, against the advice of his superiors, saying that he \ldblquote was starting to feel intellectual stagnation and had learned at Bowdoin not to be afraid of the unknown but to seek it out and flourish from it.\rdblquote  \par He founded the Duquesne Capital firm. After successfully surviving the stock market crash of \rquote 87, he was hailed as the \ldblquote heir apparent to the Dreyfus empire.\rdblquote  He ignored the advice of his advisors, once again, to stay with Dreyfus, and instead jumped into the global markets and accepted a job with George Soros. \par Soros was known for having fired eight partners in seven years, and Druckenmiller said, \ldblquote To tell you the truth, I figured I would be fired but not before I got the equivalent of a Ph.D. in global markets. The next 12 years took me on a magical intellectual journey\u8230\'c9.\par \ldblquote It is a pure coincidence that the financial rewards have been so ridiculous in a job I truly love and would have been perfectly happy in had they been much less.\rdblquote  \par Druckenmiller then spoke on the obligation of \ldblquote those of us who have reaped disproportionate benefits\rdblquote  to become active philanthropists, not to just \ldblquote blindly write checks but to take the distribution of those gains very seriously.\rdblquote  \par He and his wife concentrate their philanthropic resources in four areas: youth development in at-risk areas, worldwide human rights, cancer and infectious diseases, and education. \par \ldblquote One of the biggest jokes in our society is the praise and awards heaped on philanthropists. What else are we going to do with the money\emdash take it to our coffin?\rdblquote  \par Druckenmiller expressed his genuine admiration for Geoffrey Canada \lquote 74 and his work at the Rheedlen Center in Harlem, and said that not everyone was cut out for that sort of \ldblquote in the trenches\rdblquote  work. \par He advised students to keep in mind that \ldblquote when you leave this place, there are many ways to serve the common good\u8230\'c9., whether you do public service work, join the medical profession, whatever; but for many of you, it may be working in a field that provides outsized financial renumeration. If so, I urge you to fund the Geoff Canadas of the world, not just for society but for yourself.\rdblquote  \par He concluded by saying that the more that students learn to take risks while at Bowdoin, the more they will be able to make the smart career choices later on that will allow them to be in a position to make the maximum contribution to the common good. \par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\caps\fs16 \par }{\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \v\fs48\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\tc {\v\fs48 \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 Druckenmiller encourages students to take risks}}}{\fs48 \par }\pard\plain \s1\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel0\adjustright \fs48\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 News\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4  \hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 2\par }\pard\plain \s2\keepn\widctlpar\outlinelevel1\adjustright \b\fs28\loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\hich\af4\dbch\af4\loch\f4 U.S. continues to focus on Florida}\par \pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\scaps\cf1 Hugh Van der Veer}{\scaps \par }{\caps\fs16 staff writer}{\caps\fs16 \par \par }\pard\plain \s15\qj\fi180\widctlpar\adjustright \f21\fs18\cf1\cgrid {\cf0 Ten days after the November 7 election, the U.S. still has not chosen a successor for President Bill Clinton. \par The election has come down to Florida, where the original count gave Governor George W. Bush the lead and thus, in theory, the presidency. However, the margin of Governor Bush\rquote s victory was so small that the Florida election law mandated a recount. \par This recount was initially scheduled to be completed by this past Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. At that time, Florida\rquote s Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that after the recount, Governor Bush had a 300-vote lead over the Vice President. \par However, the overseas ballots, which traditionally lean Republican, are still being counted through today, although they will likely maintain his lead. It seems unlikely that the election will be decided by the end of today, though, as a variety of lawsuits are still waiting to be heard.\par One problem is the unresolved ballot issue in Palm Beach and Broward Counties, Florida. The Palm Beach ballots have come under a great deal of criticism for their design. \par In order to vote, a person must punch out a hole for his or her candidate. Sometimes, however, the hole is ambiguous, and the computer cannot read the ballot and therefore disregards it. The Democrats have said that they are hoping that a manual recount of the ballots will give Gore a majority in Florida. \par Broward County is having many of the same problems, but officials have not yet decided to perform a hand recount. However, that decision might be made for them if a Democratic lawsuit succeeds in mandating a recount. \par Questions still remain as to whether these recounts will even matter, though. Bush spokesperson Karen Hughes said she believes that \ldblquote counties controlled by Democrats have said they may continue a manual count. Yet if they go forward after the deadline, these Democratic counties are\u8230\'c9attempting to reinterpret the results.\rdblquote  \par Another problem that has surfaced in the past couple days in Florida deals with incorrect votes. Democrats contend that the ballots in some counties are misleading. They argue that many Gore supporters failed to understand the punch ballot and voted for Pat Buchanan instead of Gore. \par Democratic lawyers are scheduled for a court hearing today where they will try to determine the constitutionality of a revote. This is a very controversial topic, though, and will likely not be decided until it reaches the Florida Supreme Court. In general, most, if not all, of the lawsuits will likely be heard by the Florida Supreme Court, as both Democrats and Republicans agree that the decisions should be made by the same court. \par No one seems to know when and how the court will decide, and so the results of this election may not be known for some time. However, if litigation does not affect the election, an unlikely scenario, then the absentee ballots and recounts should all be tabulated by Monday night. \par As it stands now, it appears that the Republicans will control the House and Senate by only the narrowest of margins. Additionally, the next president will have to govern when he has only won by a handful of votes. Many have begun to question what the government will be able to accomplish regardless of who wins. \par Leaders like Senator Trent Lott (R) have said that they believe that, without a clear mandate, the Republicans and Democrats will have to work together at a time when everyone agrees that there are vast ideological differences between them. Lott did try to reassure Americans by noting that President Jefferson, our third president, was chosen only after 36 ballots in Congress, and he did okay.\par }\pard\plain \widctlpar\adjustright \loch\af4\hich\af4\dbch\f4\cgrid {\par }}
