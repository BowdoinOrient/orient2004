      <p>&quot;In the sea change, nothing is safe,&quot; croons Beck Hansen in 
        the climax of his new album. The statement is telling, and there's a reason 
        why Sea Change is the title of Beck's latest effort. The genre-mixing, 
        sample-happy hipster of the 90s is gone, at least temporarily. </p>
      <p>The last time we heard from this guy, he was singing &quot;I want to 
        defy the logic of all sexx laws!&quot; and posturing as a 70s disco soulman 
        in pink leather pants on his 2000 album Midnite Vultures. That was a great 
        album, but Beck's extensive usage of his falsetto got so annoying that 
        it made the overall high quality of the album negligible. </p>
      <p>Beck still likes pink, which is all over the album artwork, but Sea Change 
        is otherwise light years away. Resigned and depressed after his break-up 
        with his girlfriend of nearly ten years, Beck has stopped playing around 
        and written a collection of sad songs. Sea Change marks the first time 
        that he's put the songs in front instead of the sounds for an entire album. 
        Backed by a full band and wrapped in the floating atmospheric production 
        of Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis, and Beck's Mutations), Beck also 
        proves that he can really sing (one of the many parallels between Sea 
        Change and fellow SoCal alternative veterans Red Hot Chili Pepper's surprisingly 
        mature new masterpiece By the Way). </p>
      <p>The drifting space-country sound of &quot;The Golden Age&quot; sets a 
        mood for the album musically and lyrically. Beck's pen has turned from 
        abstract beat poetry to a more straightforward approach, but it's still 
        very good, highlighted by a biting wit. &quot;These days I barely get 
        by / I don't even try,&quot; he admits. Two songs later, &quot;Guess I'm 
        Doing Fine&quot; is driven home by this gem: &quot;It's only lies that 
        I'm living / It's only tears that I'm crying / It's only you that I'm 
        losing / Guess I'm doing fine.&quot; </p>
      <p>The album is populated by a variation of both pretty and depressing ballads. 
        &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; is driven by string flourishes. &quot;Lonesome 
        Tear&quot; is a heavy, building epic. The psychedelic &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; 
        and the haunted, Bowie-esque &quot;Little One&quot; also stand out.</p>
      <p>Beck's last collaboration with Godrich, 1998's Mutations, wasn't even 
        intended for mass consumption; but David Geffen somehow managed to steal 
        it from the indie label Bong Load. That album was a loose session dipped 
        in tropicalia and psychedelia. The flavor fit Beck like a glove and Mutations 
        stands as his most enjoyable album. That said, his biggest hit, the experimental, 
        brilliantly original 1996 Odelay! is his most important. </p>
      <p>Sea Change, with its country-tinged chillness, is different but equally 
        as impressive as these two and deserves a place in the pantheon of great 
        Beck albums. It should take some time to fully digest but will definitely 
        leave fans satiated until this chameleon completes his next masterpiece.</p>
