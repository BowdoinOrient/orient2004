      <blockquote><i>I saw men standing on the sidewalks clapping their hands 
        in a queer way, obviously just to be doing something. I saw men talking 
        to themselves, walking around, stopping, looking into shop windows, walking 
        again.<br>
        For several minutes I watched an elderly man who stood on a deserted corner 
        near the enormous and idle Everett Mills in the posture of an undotted 
        [sic] question mark. He did not see me. Every now and then he swung his 
        arms, not because it was cold, but no doubt because he wanted activity 
        other than walking around, which he probably had been doing for years, 
        in a vain effort to get a job. He mumbled to himself. Then, suddenly, 
        he stepped off the curb and picked up a long piece of string from a pile 
        of rubbish, and his big work-eager hands began to work with it, tying 
        and untying it feverishly. He worked with the strong for several minutes. 
        Then he looked around and, seeing me, dropped the string, his haggard, 
        hollow face coloring a little as though from a sense of guilt, or intense 
        embarrassment. He was shaken and confused and stood there for several 
        seconds, looking down at the rubbish heap, then up at me. His hands finally 
        dropped to his sides. Then his arms swung in a sort of idle reflex motion 
        and he turned, hesitated a while as if he did not know where to go, and 
        finally shuffled off, flapping his arms. I noticed that his overcoat was 
        split in the back and that his heels were worn off completely.</i></blockquote>
        
      <p>The situation, however, was not as bleak for everyone. Here was a generation 
        that could feel its pulse and deeply believed that five horrible years 
        of its optimistic and idealistic world had been taken away by war. Despite 
        the Depression, the generation strove boldly onward. Science and technology 
        had brought forth the automobile-the one true love of the decade. Between 
        the years of 1920 and 1929, thirty-one million automobiles had been manufactured 
        and in the decade that followed millions more would be sold. In Manhattan 
        the Waldorf Astoria opened its doors to the public in 1931 alongside the 
        newly christened Empire State Building, the tallest structure in the world. 
        Baseball continued to be the favorite sport as stars such as Babe Ruth 
        and Joe DiMaggio stunned audiences nationwide. Without the lavish lifestyle 
        of the 1920s, Americans of the 1930s adapted and found other ways of enjoying 
        themselves. Board games and hobbies became popular among other things; 
        miniature golf became widely accepted-so well, in fact, that the Department 
        of Commerce estimated that it was a one hundred and twenty-five million-dollar 
        industry. Comic strips like &quot;Blondie,&quot; &quot;Dick Tracy,&quot; 
        &quot;Prince Valian,.&quot; and &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; brought 
        adventure and laughs to Americans nationwide. Movie theaters also boomed 
        in this era. To escape the reality of a depression-hit country, Americans 
        flocked to movie houses and stared dreamily at adventures in far off lands. 
        By the end of the 1930s it was estimated that more than 50 million people 
        went to the movies weekly. John Steinbeck remembered:</p>
      <blockquote><i>For entertainment we had the public library, endless talk, 
        long walks, any number of games. We played music, sang and made love. 
        Enormous invention went into our pleasures. Anything at all was an excuse 
        for a party: all holidays, birthdays called for celebration. When we felt 
        the need to celebrate and the calendar was blank, we simply proclaimed 
        a Jacks-Are-Wild Day.</i></blockquote>
        There was, however, one community, that could not afford the joys of celebrating 
        any day they wanted-the farmers of the Midwest. In November of 1933, the 
        first in a series of devastating dust storms pounded South Dakota. Remembered 
        one witness:<br>
        
      <blockquote><i>By mid-morning a gale was blowing, cold and black. By noon 
        it was blacker than night, because one can see through night and this 
        was an opaque black. It was a wall of dirt one's eyes could not penetrate, 
        but it could penetrate the eyes and ears and nose. It could penetrate 
        to the lungs until one coughed up black. If a person was outside, he tied 
        his handkerchief around his face, but he sill coughed up black; and inside 
        the house the Karnstrums soaked sheets and towels and stuffed them around 
        the window ledges, but these didn't help much. &#133;<br>
        When the wind died and the sun shone forth again, it was on a different 
        world. There were no fields, only sand drifting into mounds and eddies 
        that swirled in what was now but an autumn breeze. There was no longer 
        a section-line road fifty feet from the front door. It was obliterated. 
        In the farmyard, fences, machinery, and trees were gone, buried. The roofs 
        of sheds stuck out through drifts deeper than a man is tall.</i></blockquote>
        From Texas to Canada, a swath of destruction settled upon the land. The 
        &quot;great black blizzard,&quot; which blocked the sun in Chicago and 
        was witnessed in New York State, was a mere taste of the years of devastation 
        to come. Thousands of farms were laid waste by the wrath of Mother Nature, 
        who had long witnessed the careless destruction of the Great Plains. It 
        took years and many millions of dollars before this natural scrooge was 
        finally contained.<br>
        Yet, neither nature nor financial ruin could halt some who had their eyes 
        not only on the distant past but also, still looking-like a weary boxer 
        near the end of his rope-for a bright glimmer of hope that the future 
        they had dreamed of in their youths would still survive. As they looked 
        back five thousand years they also looked forward five thousand more. 
        Somehow it came to be that a group of scientists and intellectual leaders 
        got together enough funding, in the fall of 1938, to create what was known 
        as the &quot;Time Capsule of Cupaloy&quot;. With this time capsule, they 
        hoped &quot;that we might leave records of our own day for five thousand 
        years hence; to a day when the peoples of the world will think of us standing 
        at history's midpoint.&quot;<br>
        Aesthetically the Time Capsule of Cupaloy-so named for it was made from 
        the newly discovered copper alloy &quot;Cupaloy&quot;-looked more like 
        it came from the 1960s when space exploration and the discovery of extraterrestrial 
        life seemed not so distant. The Capsule was seven-feet, six-inches long 
        with a streamlined-missile-shaped body. The alloy Cupaloy was supposed 
        to withstand the effects of time, as its main component was copper. Inside 
        the Capsule, there were placed microfilm reels of literature and historical 
        records, a lady's hat, a safety pin, a copy of the U.S. Constitution, 
        copies of newspapers, magazines, and a copy of the Holy Bible. Also included 
        was a guide for future civilizations-who were assumed to have moved beyond 
        the use of the English language-to reconstruct our speech and communications. 
        Finally, the Time Capsule also contained letters from leading men of the 
        time: the Noble Prize winning physicist Robert A. Millikan, the German 
        novelist Thomas Mann, and the well known theoretical physicist Albert 
        Einstein. Specially sealed in vacuum containers, these suspended elements 
        of the 1930s were placed in a nitrogen filling and sealed in the Capsule. 
        On September 23, 1938, on the site of the World's Fair in Flushing Meadows-in 
        Queens-New York, the Time Capsule of Cupaloy began its journey, fifty 
        feet into the ground and five thousand years into the future-not to be 
        disturbed until the year 6939.<br>
        But who would remember such a bold and daring endeavor by men who were 
        thinking of the future and who were perhaps also thinking of the vulnerability 
        of their times? Thousands of copies of The Book of Record of the Time 
        Capsule of Cupaloy were sent to libraries and religious structures all 
        over the world. The book, specially printed to be able to resist the effects 
        of time as long as possible, found its way across the globe to Tibet where 
        the cold spires of nature's own skyscrapers breathed a heavenly wind down 
        upon man. Copies were sent to Shinto Shrines in Japan where a powerful 
        military regime was swiftly planning the conquest of the rest of Asia. 
        In India where religious unrest was overshadowed only by protests of colonial 
        rule the Book of Record also made its way.<br>
        In North America copies of the Book of Record were sent across the nation, 
        from the Library of Congress to the small libraries in the farming towns 
        of Nebraska and North Dakota. To New England's shores the book also came. 
        Across the gray, cold beaches and wind swept hills of Massachusetts to 
        the coast of Maine, where lobsters continued to congregate in the shallow 
        waters in the millions, the book traveled by post-bag or by special delivery. 
        As it neared the town of Brunswick on the Androsscoggin River a copy found 
        its way to Hubbard Hall, that gothic, owl-like building on the campus 
        of a college that had been unchanged in its tradition and its mission 
        in decades. <br>
        On a clear night in the fall of 1938, there were lights across Bowdoin 
        College as young men from all walks of life walked to and from the ancient 
        buildings, partied in the fraternity houses, drank to their youth, discussed 
        their future, and prepared for whatever the world would throw at them. 
        These were the boys who had lived through the Great Depression and the 
        boys who would lead the future, which had been so derailed from its intended 
        glory almost forty years ago at the dawn of the new century.<br>
        Yet there was more derailing to do as the world moved on its course through 
        history's intended path. Away from the cigarette smoke and the fine suits 
        of the young men of Bowdoin, there was worry and concern in the midnight 
        air. Deep in the ground below the World's Fair there was a letter from 
        Robert Millikan who looked with foreboding glances into the dark clouds 
        of a new world conflict and wrote to an audience he could never imagine 
        five thousand years from his time:<br>
        
      <blockquote><i>At this moment, August 22, 1938, the principle representative 
        ballot government, such as are represented by the governments of the Anglo-Saxon, 
        French, and Scandinavian countries, are in deadly conflict with the principles 
        of despotism, which up to two centuries ago had controlled the destiny 
        of man throughout practically the whole of recorded history. If the rational, 
        scientific, progressive principles win out in this struggle there is a 
        possibility of a warless, golden age ahead for mankind. If the reactionary 
        principles of despotism triumph now and in the future, the future history 
        of mankind will repeat the sad story of war and oppression as in the past. 
        </i></blockquote>
