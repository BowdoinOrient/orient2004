      <p align="left">&quot;Is it me,&quot; my friend asked the other day, &quot;or 
        are people less friendly this year than they were last year?&quot; I don't 
        really have an answer to that question. Generally speaking, one of Bowdoin's 
        virtues is that it is filled with friendly people. </p>
      <p align="left">I was once told last year that sophomore year is the hump 
        in college, because it is characterized by this in-between state of everything 
        no longer being new, and by getting ready to go abroad. I don't know if 
        disenchantment is the right word for that state, but it is what I felt 
        when I walked into the dining hall for my first meal back here. Everything 
        was the same. </p>
      <p align="left">I don't really know that I had expected anything to change. 
        I hadn't really thought about it. But it was one of those &quot;Oh, my 
        God, I'm here. Again.&quot; moments. And it really isn't that people are 
        less friendly. It is that I'm tired of the superficiality and artificiality 
        of the generic &quot;What's up? How are you?&quot; conversations that 
        unequivocally fail to move me in any way. I wouldn't even call those encounters 
        conversations except that they are practically the only way we choose 
        to interact with each other. </p>
      <p align="left">A conversation is an exchange. It is a force. It is a gift, 
        and it is one of the biggest voids in this community. We don't have time 
        for it, or we don't have the energy to invest in it. And we don't even 
        know how much that loss imposes upon us, how much it drains us. </p>
      <p align="left">Last night, I listened to a friend describe what he calls 
        the &quot;warm fuzzies&quot; as that moment when you are entirely conscious 
        of someone doing something for you that they don't have to be doing: at 
        the super market, when someone bags your groceries, at a shoe store when 
        the salesman laces your shoes, in the Union when you drop a book and someone 
        picks it up for you. As he described the &quot;warm fuzzies,&quot; I watched 
        him smile, invested in the possibilities that other people have to change 
        our lives. </p>
      <p align="left">And I smiled. I'm still smiling, in fact, because that moment 
        was a &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; for me. That exchange, that interaction, 
        that moment held more power than most of what I have lived in the past 
        month, because it was genuine; it was real, and it was so simple. </p>
      <p align="left">In a world in which we are always striving for bigger and 
        better, the most fundamentally human interaction, the most overlooked 
        and forgotten moments of connection and communion sustain us in ways we 
        are too busy to notice, too driven to believe in, too shy or too conditioned 
        to know how to ask for. </p>
      <p align="left">I don't know how to change the way we live, so that we have 
        to stop and see the treasury of the possibilities. I don't know how to 
        make you believe what I've just written, except that I know that the only 
        existing perfection is momentary, and it depends entirely on our ability 
        to connect, to converse, to commune with each other in the most basically 
        human ways we know. </p>
