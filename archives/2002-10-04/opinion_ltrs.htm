      <p align="left"><font size="5">FMLA is calling all feminists</font></p>
      <p align="left"> To the Community: </p>
      <p> The stigmatism around the word &quot;feminism&quot; is very disconcerting 
        to me as a woman who considers herself to be a feminist. So many assumptions 
        and misconceptions prevent people from being open to the idea of feminism. 
        So I ask you, what is &quot;feminism?&quot; In formal terms, it is the 
        policy, practice or advocacy of political, economic and social equality 
        for women. Therefore, a feminist is anyone who believes in equality for 
        all women and men. This means that a feminist can be ANYONE-man, woman, 
        straight, gay, bisexual, or transgender. A feminist is NOT strictly a 
        man-hating militant running around burning her bra, as is commonly believed; 
        and yet people are still hesitant to embrace the concept. But if you believe 
        in equality, then I am afraid you cannot call yourself anything but a 
        feminist.</p>
      <p>For those of you, women and men alike, who would like to activate your 
        newly found, or seasoned, feminist side, there is now a group looking 
        for you! It's known as the Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance (FMLA). 
        The FMLA is a student-run organization committed to bringing equality 
        and awareness to Bowdoin's campus and getting things done. It focuses 
        on informing young feminists of the very real threats to abortion access, 
        women's rights, and affirmative action. The FMLA seeks to empower students 
        to effect change at the grassroots, national, and global levels in order 
        to expand feminist choices, career options, women in leadership, and to 
        fight the backlash on campus, in the community, and across the country 
        using different types of major events as its vehicle. Some ideas already 
        in motion are: Get Out HER Vote, a campaign to register and mobilize voters 
        for the 2002 elections, as well as educating voters about the political 
        power of the gender gap; Take Back the Night, which is done to raise awareness 
        and stand up for those who have been sexually assaulted; Never Go Back, 
        which is a campaign focused on educating people about the impending threat 
        to legal abortion and the role of the Supreme Court in affirming or overturning 
        Roe v. Wade; and expanding health center hours to include the weekends, 
        and make emergency contraception (EC) more available to students-especially 
        on the weekends. Meetings are Monday nights at 9 p.m. at the Women's Resource 
        Center. Hope to see you there! For more information contact nfava@bowdoin.edu 
        or eyamada@bowdoin.edu. </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Bring back pre-season practices</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Dear Presidents,<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I write to you today in the sincere hope that you will consider 
        my request for a brief suspension of the new policy, adopted just last 
        week, prohibiting student-athletes from practicing their respective sports 
        outside of the dates specifically mandated by the Conference. It is not 
        my intention, as I write this letter, to suggest that there is anything 
        valid or worthwhile about athletic practice in preparation for an upcoming 
        season. For many of us, pre-season practice and off-season training are 
        precisely what enable us to improve our skills and develop our potential. 
        Still, I'm sure I would be dismissed as ridiculous were I to assert any 
        correlation between the level of play in our athletic events and the level 
        of satisfaction we derive from them, the value of the lessons we learn 
        from them, etc. May we play, in all our athletic competitions, at the 
        lowest possible level, and may our teams be disorganized and perpetually 
        winded: that's always been my mantra. And of course, besides studying 
        for a test in one of our classes, what good does preparation do us in 
        any of our endeavors here at Bowdoin? Surely we would never encourage 
        our musicians to practice their instruments together in days leading up 
        to a recital, and we strongly caution our artists against any sketching 
        prior to a finished work, lest they develop tendentious. No, our singers 
        just show up and sing, our painters mindlessly hurl paint onto canvas; 
        our dancers instinctively know all their places, and our actors practice 
        their lines in utter solitude, if at all. And so too should be our athletes, 
        restricted to a minimal and solitary training, confined to a schedule 
        of someone else's making, and they should lower their aspirations, if 
        they ever had any for something so meaningless as an athletic season.</p>
      <p align="left">I accept this decision on other grounds, too! The decision 
        to suspend pre-season practices originated at Colby, did it not? Well 
        then, what example are we, as the Bowdoin community, supposed to follow 
        if not that which is presented to us by the Colby community? I, for one, 
        shudder to think of following in any other footsteps.</p>
      <p align="left">So it is having already conceded&#133;no, proclaimed!&#133;complete 
        agreement with the ban on all pre-season athletic practices that I humbly 
        ask you this: would it be allowable for my two roommates and I to go out 
        on to the baseball field and commence defensive drills? We are all student-athletes 
        here at Bowdoin, and we were all actively preparing for upcoming winter 
        seasons. We are also all mediocre baseball players; none of us have ever 
        played a baseball game here at Bowdoin. But, in a moment of weakness several 
        weeks ago, we inexplicably sought to improve, and, impulsively (to say 
        the least), made purchase of a videotape endorsed by Fred Mcgriff and 
        entitled &quot;Tom Emansky's Defensive Drills Video.&quot; We ask your 
        permission to use the video and see where it leads. Though the makers 
        of this film claim credit as having produced back-to-back-to-back national 
        champions at the AAU level, we harbor little hope that our practice will 
        ever lead to any real achievements: rest assured, it's already far too 
        late for us to reach a high level in the sport. Which is not to say that 
        we don't have any talent&#133;</p>
      <p align="left">I guess we just didn't start practicing soon enough. </p>
