        <font size="2">TIMOTHY J. RIEMER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> This week one of my friends whom I have a bet with over 
        the future of stock market took out his frustration on President Bush. 
        This seems to me to be a common occurrence lately. The decline in the 
        president's approval rating seems to be directly correlated with worries 
        over the economy and over a potential war with Iraq. Although his rating 
        as of September 19 was in 60s to low 70s, depending on the poll, I am 
        sure it has dropped since then due to further troubles with the stock 
        market. The point that interests me here is whether the president actually 
        has the power to move the economy. In other words, is President Bush really 
        responsible for our economic woes?</p>
      <p align="left">Of course the easiest thing to do is to blame current economic 
        difficulties on the president, but actions taken by the president, at 
        least President Bush, aren't to blame here. There is a serious time lag 
        between any sort of economic reform and its actual impact on the economy. 
        Therefore it is hard to say that President Bush really is the cause of 
        any current economic difficulties that we are facing, but only of any 
        future problems. In fact it is hard to blame any one person for the troubles 
        we are having. As a matter of fact, many experts, during the heavy stock 
        market decline in July, were noting the president's lack of power in turning 
        investor confidence around. Furthermore, Alan Greenspan, a man in the 
        position thought to have the most power of the status of at least the 
        financial markets if not the entire market, is losing the power to control 
        the economy as record low interest rates are running out of room and power. 
        The marginal effects of lowering interest rates at this stage are greatly 
        diminished.</p>
      <p align="left">The economic troubles that we are currently facing are most 
        likely the result of misallocation of capital (a.k.a. cash) during the 
        late 1990s. When investors were mistakenly pouring hundreds of millions 
        of dollars into areas like telecommunications during the late 1990s, they 
        were not investing their money where they should have been. Hindsight 
        is always 20-20, to use a cheesy clich&eacute;, but now it is very clear 
        that many companies received too much capital and that many companies 
        did not receive enough. Now that many companies with great potential for 
        future profits are trying to raise capital, they are having a very difficult 
        time because investors simply do not have the money to invest like they 
        did before.</p>
      <p align="left">This misallocation of funds was also the result of some 
        less than ethical accounting practices, and other deeds of corporate wrongdoing. 
        These acts made investors think that companies were stronger and better 
        than they actually were, and hence the money invested in companies like 
        Enron and WorldCom is now not in the hands of investors when they need 
        it.<br>
        As much as I, and many other people would like to pin the blame for this 
        rather lackluster economy on President Bush, we simply cannot. However, 
        President Bush's current actions will contribute to the length of these 
        hard times and/or future recessions. Economic reform, such as the $300 
        dollar tax rebate that every American was supposed receive, in light of 
        current times, might have been better spent in cutting this year's deficit. 
        It is the decisions that President Bush makes now that we must be critical 
        of in order to secure our economic future. </p>
