      <p align="left"><font size="5">Three reasons why Guns N' Roses will never go out of style<br>
        <font size="2">MACAELA FLANAGAN</font></font><font size="5"><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As if you needed someone to tell you that Guns n' Roses 
        is one of the best things ever to happen to the music industry. But just 
        in case you did, read on. Here are three reasons, in no particular order, 
        why we all need a little GNR in our lives&#133;.</p>
      <p align="left">Reason #1: Night Train. Everyone sings about sex, drugs, 
        and rock and roll. Not everyone sings about the cheapest wine available 
        for purchase (about $3.50/750ml). Next time you're sheepishly carrying 
        a bottle of boxed wine to the check out aisle, just think, &quot;Hey, 
        it could be a lot worse. I could be buying Night Train.&quot; Unfortunately, 
        I have never tried the Train myself. However, if Axl's testimony of &quot;been 
        drinkin' gasoline&quot; is at all accurate (Night Train is 17.5%), perhaps 
        it is wisest to leave the Train to the masters.</p>
      <p align="left">Reason #2: Welcome to the Videos. If you've never seen Welcome 
        to the Videos, I suggest you trot to Bull Moose right now and get yourself 
        a copy. This VHS release includes a wide selection of GNR's videography, 
        an impressive collection if I do say so myself. There are many reasons 
        why to add this to your rotation, but one of the most convincing is the 
        Gary Oldman look-alike in &quot;Since I Don't Have You.&quot; How often 
        do you get to see GNR and a devil-clad Gary Oldman? Never. This is pure 
        magic. As if that wasn't enough to send you straight to the video store, 
        Welcome allows us to watch the cake-diving scene in &quot;November Rain&quot; 
        as many times as we please. And Axl adorers, never fear; there is enough 
        big hair and skin tight spandex shorts for all.</p>
      <p align="left">Reason #3: Slash. As bad ass as Axl wants to be, he'll never 
        quite live up to the enigma that is otherwise known as Slash. Perhaps 
        this is why Axl tries to compensate by wearing such tight pants. Perhaps 
        Slash's cool confidence was too much for Axl and led to the untimely demise 
        of GNR. Part screaming guitar viciousness, part misunderstood loner - 
        Slash is in a class of his own.</p>
      <p align="left">So you see, GNR are one of the late eighties/early nineties 
        essentials. One of my first GNR memories is buying a copy of Use Your 
        Illusion I and having my parents confiscate it because of that obnoxious 
        &quot;EXPLICIT LYRICS&quot; sticker. Or of course there were all those 
        times at the summer fairs, listening to hours of back to back GNR and 
        Aerosmith. If you are from Maine, chances are you know what I am talking 
        about. My fair of choice was the Union Fair; as other fairs it was fully 
        equipped with lots of carnies, mullets, over excessive use of the butterfly 
        clip, and homemade tattoos. And you simply cannot have these things without 
        GNR.</p>
      <p align="left">GNR have influenced a generation with their bad boy style 
        and energetic music. I would dare say that the opening of &quot;Sweet 
        Child O' Mine&quot; is one of the most recognizable melodies in rock history. 
        I would also bet that half of the Bowdoin College student body experienced 
        their first kiss while listening to &quot;November Rain&quot; (or maybe 
        Stairway, but that is another article in itself). Call them crude, call 
        them a hair band, but it must be agreed that all of our lives would be 
        missing a little something had GNR never invaded our radios.</p>
