      <p align="left">While the rainy weather descends on the Bowdoin campus, 
        BOC members think back to the beautiful sun and radiant temperatures of 
        last weekend with sighs of contentment. Last Friday, the Outing Club sent 
        off two intense hiking trips to tackle sections of the Appalachian Trail. 
        The Leadership Trainees explored Caribou Mountain and the Speckled Mountain 
        Wilderness near Bethel, Maine during their skills weekend trip. This weekend 
        is designed to teach future leaders proficiency in outdoor living and 
        wilderness trip leading. They learned, among other things, how to set 
        up tents, use the stoves, navigate, pick a good campsite, treat unsafe 
        water, and manage a group of college kids. A pretty tough job, if you 
        ask me. </p>
      <p align="left">Sunday provided the sea kayaking and climbing day trips 
        with beautiful weather in which to enjoy the Maine coast. The kayakers 
        left from Bethel Point and spent the day splashing about until it began 
        to get a little too windy for comfort. They returned mid-afternoon in 
        plenty of time to complete all their homework, as I am sure they needed 
        too. The climbers headed up to Camden to enjoy the scenic climbs on the 
        Camden Hills. Even though climbers are usually staring at the rocks in 
        front of them, I hope that Sundays tripees got a chance to turn around 
        and admire the amazing views of Penobscot Bay that this climb affords.</p>
      <p align="left">This weekend, the BOC trips are a bit different in that 
        on Saturday your parents are invited too. The Outing Club is sending child/parents 
        trips to Morse Mountain for a short hike and to the Cathance River for 
        some canoeing. These trips are a great way to relax with your parents 
        and show them the amazing natural beauty of the area surrounding Brunswick. 
        There will also be a regular, student-only, sea kayaking trip going out 
        on Sunday. This will be the last day trip of the season, but be sure to 
        mark your calendars for the sea kayak overnight leaving on October 19. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Our fall break trips, which leave next Friday, are an exciting 
        opportunity to spend some extended time in the wilderness without the 
        pressures of work and school. We have three great trips going out for 
        fall break: canoeing, hiking and trail building. The canoeing and hiking 
        trips will be traveling to great, remote destinations. The service trip 
        will be building a trail that is sure to be used by many future generations. 
        What a great way to give back to the outdoors community! Sign-up sheets 
        will be posted on Monday morning and are sure to fill up fast.</p>
      <p align="left">The BOC also has two slideshows coming up. At the OLC, this 
        Saturday at 8pm, we will be re-showing the Pre-O slideshow from this past 
        summer. First years are encouraged to come and to bring their parents 
        along to show them all the crazy things they did before officially arriving 
        at Bowdoin. On Tuesday, October 8, at 8pm in the OLC, Josh Howell will 
        be speaking about his adventures in Chile and Argentina. Josh has been 
        living in South America for five years and has recently completed a guide 
        book to the area. He has promised great pictures and crazy stories. Please 
        come and bring your friends! Don't forget about open pool session for 
        kayaking on Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., and the climbing wall in 
        Sargeant Gym, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Have 
        a great weekend, and get outside! </p>
