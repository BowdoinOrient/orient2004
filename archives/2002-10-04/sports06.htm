        <font size="2">BRENDAN DICKINSON</font><font size="2"><br>
        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Playing upon a field recently strewn with glass shards, 
        the men of Bowdoin's Ultimate Frisbee team, a.k.a. the Stoned Clown, took 
        a step forward in their quest to qualify for nationals with an impressive 
        showing at Sectionals in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p align="left">Despite graduating five experienced seniors, including two-year 
        captain John &quot;Konen&quot; Knapp '02, the team finished 4-1 on the 
        day and came in third in their division, qualifying for Regionals - one 
        step away from the big dance.</p>
      <p align="left">Before a disc could be thrown, the fields of the Fitchburg 
        Municipal Airport needed to be removed of debris from the previous week's 
        airshow. Broken bottles, nails, and various shards of glass littered the 
        field before the clean-up process began. </p>
      <p align="left">Despite the numerous complaints from teams, the Ultimate 
        Player's Association could only offer the assurances that Ambulances would 
        be provided if they were needed.</p>
      <p align="left">With the field ready for action, the Clown faced MIT's B 
        team and later Worchester Poly-Tech's B team. Neither team provided trouble 
        for a talented Clown team that last year tied MIT A for third place in 
        the Sectionals and defeated WPI's A team 13-1. </p>
      <p align="left">The two early games were a good warm-up for the Clown and 
        allowed the younger players to log quality playing time. Highlights included 
        sophomore Pat &quot;Teddy&quot; Mahoney's interception in MIT's end zone 
        for a score (an incredibly rare occurrence called a Callahan). Not to 
        be outdone, Andrew &quot;Nutz&quot; Fischer '05, motivated the Clown team 
        with infectious energy both on the field and off. </p>
      <p align="left">Asked about Teddy's Callahan, Nutz simply replied, &quot;That 
        man loves the cock [Nutz's term for a Frisbee], and I think he wanted 
        MIT to know that he is better than their entire team, and it motivated 
        him to make that ridiculous play.&quot; The Clown ended up beating MIT 
        B 15-3 and WPI B 15-1.</p>
      <p align="left">After a bye, the team played the second-seed Swell, a club 
        team from Portland. It was a heated battle, in which Bowdoin jumped to 
        an early 6-1 lead only to see Swell tie it back up at 7-7. </p>
      <p align="left">Bismark '04, a team captain, called a timeout to help regain 
        Clown poise, Bowdoin came out strong and scored to take the half. Captain 
        Alex &quot;Throat&quot; Rosati '03 said, &quot;It was the most poised 
        I've ever seen the Clown in my 4 years.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">In the second-half, Bowdoin continued to play with fire, 
        and was able to trade points to make it 13-10. Like any good team, the 
        Clown dialed it up a notch to earn a 15-11 victory on a throw from Throat 
        to Tim McIntire '04. <br>
        Bismark couldn't believe that Tim made the catch saying &quot;I was all 
        worried, 'cause Timmy never catches anything, but he caught it. He must 
        have had some special stickem on his hands.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">In the next game, Bowdoin fell to its Alumni team, Old Fat 
        Clown, and then received a forfeit from a high school team to come in 
        third overall. <br>
        The Sectional MVP for the Clown was clearly Captain Sam &quot;Tupac&quot; 
        Terry '04, who played his best game as a Polar Bear, or Clown. Other veterans, 
        Free &quot;Workhorse 'Willy'&quot; Church '05, Adam &quot;Hieman&quot; 
        Ringel '04, Kurt &quot;Cleatus&quot; Jendrek '04, and John &quot;Eiffel&quot; 
        Crowell turned in strong performances. </p>
      <p align="left">When asked to sum up the day, Nick &quot;Shaft&quot; Hiebert 
        '03 could only say, &quot;It was the new Hotness.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The Clown is looking forward to strong performances as the 
        season progresses. Over Fall Break, they will compete at the Clambake, 
        a two-day tournament held at Bowdoin that draws some of the best teams 
        in the nation. And, of course, the fields will not be littered with glass.</p>
      <p align="left">The Clown will end the season with tournaments at Bates 
        and another at home, which will allow the highly talented rookie pool 
        to prove their mettle. The Clown's mixture of youth and experience will 
        carry the team this fall and provide for a bright future.</p>
