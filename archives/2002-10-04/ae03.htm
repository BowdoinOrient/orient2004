        <font size="2">MONICA GUZMAN<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p>Last weekend I, M&oacute;nica Guzm&aacute;n, wanna-be film critic and 
        lover of all that is artful and good, saw The Tuxedo, the Jackie Chan 
        film. Why? Well, because it was either that or Reese Witherspoon's Sweet 
        Home Alabama. And when you're stuck between cheesy action and cheesy chick 
        flick, and you happen to be going with two guys, the choice is quite clear. 
      </p>
      <p>The important thing to note is that I didn't go to this expecting it 
        to be any good. In fact, I expected it to be pretty bad. I came prepared. 
        But even with that generous standard, I was still disappointed. Yeah, 
        I know what you're thinking. I'm just a picky filmgoer who only likes 
        Best Pictures and doesn't know how to sit back and have fun. Boo-hoo. 
      </p>
      <p>But I really was just looking to have fun-honest. After all, when you 
        know a film's got no artistic quality, entertainment's the only thing 
        it has to go on. Thrills, chills, laughs-sure, they're fleeting without 
        meaning to hold them up, but not entirely worthless.</p>
      <p>The Tuxedo is Jackie Chan's usual ordinary-guy-turns-hero story of yore. 
        Tong, James Tong, a New York City cab driver, is hired as chauffeur to 
        Clark Devlin (), a Bondish secret agent working for the government, or 
        something. When a car bomb puts Devlin out of service, Tong takes over 
        his identity to find the bad guy, and in the process puts on Devlin's 
        tuxedo, a body-invading high-tech fighting machine. So with that, he pairs 
        up with , (Jennifer Love Hewitt?!) and stumbles his way to victory. There 
        is more to this-something about a spring water CEO with aspirations of 
        world domination, and then some killer water striders-but we don't need 
        to get into that. </p>
      <p>So why wasn't it fun? Well, because it was stupid. </p>
      <p>First stupidity: sucky fight scenes in a Jackie Chan film. I mean, come 
        on. You'd think they'd work a little harder with the choreography. Kicking 
        butt in style is what this guy does best (and acting is what he does the 
        worst). But here, the fight scenes are toned down and unusually lazy; 
        they're downright cheap and we all know it. It's ridiculous. They interrupt 
        the flow of the movie instead of keeping it going. You'd think a fighting 
        tuxedo would be able to pull off something more exciting than clich&eacute;d 
        Matrix wall-climbs; those just aren't fun anymore. And a car chase scene 
        in New York City where the car is being chased by a skateboard? Come on 
        now. Try just a little harder.</p>
      <p>But this sin doesn't compare to the film's other grotesque error: casting 
        Jennifer Love Hewitt as Jackie's leading lady. As if she weren't annoying 
        enough as an actress, they had to put her in an action film. All she was 
        good for was wearing those gorgeous and uncomfortable dresses spies have 
        no business wearing. Is this some kind of sick joke? She's not funny, 
        and she can't be intimidating. She's not even funny when she tries to 
        be intimidating, so there's no redeeming value in casting her at all. 
        Not to mention the fact that there was something almost like negative 
        chemistry between her and Jackie Chan. At every moment they were together, 
        I kept hoping that he would just smack her down and break into a rush 
        of Chinese swears. Now that's entertainment. </p>
      <p>I can't really go into plot and cinematography and score and all that, 
        because, as I mentioned before, I know this film wasn't trying to make 
        use of any of those things. But I will say that there was one part of 
        this movie I actually did enjoy: the bloopers&#133;my reward for sitting 
        through mindless crap. So if you insist on having fun at The Tuxedo, go 
        in, take your seat, sleep for an hour and a half, and tell your friends 
        to wake you up at the credits. </p>
