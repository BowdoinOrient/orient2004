      <p>Donald B. MacMillan House was dedicated last Friday in a ceremony attended 
        primarily by visiting alumni. Formerly Theta Delta Chi, the House is named 
        after Donald B. MacMillan, an arctic explorer, humanitarian, Bowdoin alumnus 
        and member of Theta Delta Chi. </p>
      <p>Speakers at the event included Michel LePage '78, the president of the 
        Alumni Council; President Barry Mills '72; Horace Hildreth '54; Gene Boyington 
        '62, current President of Theta Delta Chi House; and Mark Lucci '04, President 
        of MacMillan House. </p>
      <p>LePage welcomed the group of alumni and students, commenting on the &quot;phenomenal 
        change&quot; that has taken place in the structure as a result of the 
        renovation, and commented that, &quot;yes, the smell in the basement is 
        finally gone.&quot; LePage was a member of TDC while at Bowdoin, as were 
        about half of the people in attendance.</p>
      <p>Mills spoke next, explaining the affiliation system as well as the College 
        House system, and commented that he was &quot;proud of what this house 
        represents and of the whole system.&quot; He described some of the possible 
        projects MacMillan will be working on, including coffee houses and trips 
        to art museums. Mills stressed the leadership opportunities that are available 
        within the House System. </p>
      <p>President Mills then introduced Hildreth, who sailed to the arctic as 
        a teenager on the Bowdoin, Macmillan's specially outfitted boat. &quot;Mac 
        was a great person, great companion,&quot; recollected Hildreth. The goal 
        of that summer's expedition on the Bowdoin was to collect specimens for 
        the Arctic Museum. Almost all of the animal specimens in the museum were 
        collected that summer, and then preserved until they could be stuffed 
        by a taxidermist. </p>
      <p>Next, Boyington spoke about the importance of the fraternity to the Bowdoin 
        community, and expressed his wish for the values of the fraternity to 
        be handed down to the House System. He also thanked Jack St. John '58 
        for a plaque bearing the Theta Delta Chi letters, which was presented 
        to the college as a reminder of &quot;historic and cultural values&quot; 
        that the fraternity and the college house have shared &quot;for decades.&quot;</p>
      <p>He went on to describe the fraternity as an institution that was &quot;useful, 
        valuable, even important to undergraduate life,&quot; referring to the 
        fraternity as the &quot;fabric of the college community.&quot; Boyington 
        spoke of the enduring brotherhood and sense of family that was the fraternity, 
        emphasizing the capital F in &quot;Fraternity.&quot; In his closing remarks 
        the president of Theta Delta Chi expressed a hope that the &quot;love, 
        courage, honor, compassion, respect, trust and commitment to the common 
        good,&quot; that were central to TDC will be carried on by members of 
        MacMillan House.</p>
      <p>Lucci made a promise to take care of the house and to &quot;fulfill the 
        mission as a Bowdoin College Social House.&quot; Social House leaders 
        will be the leaders of the community, and the organization will remain 
        true to its &quot;regimen of alcoholic parties as well as non-alcoholic 
        social and cultural events,&quot; including intramurals, building with 
        Habitat for Humanity, bringing jazz bands to the house and numerous other 
        social and service events, and Lucci emphasized that MacMillan is not 
        &quot;solely an alcohol dispensing location.&quot;</p>
      <p>Greek fraternities were a part of the Bowdoin social scene for many years; 
        however, between the 1960s and 90s they devolved as an institution, according 
        to Boyington. Then in the mid 90s the college instituted a major cultural 
        and structural change by abandoning the frat system. Starting in 1997, 
        old fraternity houses were purchased by the college and renovated into 
        the current College Houses. The dedication of MacMillan marks the completion 
        of the sixth such renovation.</p>
