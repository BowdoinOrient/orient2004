      <p align="left">On Tuesday night, Professor Thomas Cornell was named the 
        Richard E. Steele Professor of Studio Art, an honor given in appreciation 
        for his forty years of developing the visual arts program at Bowdoin. 
        Applauding the event was a large audience of Bowdoin students and faculty 
        alike. All gathered in Kresge Auditorium to hear Cornell speak and present 
        slides of his artwork. </p>
      <p align="left">Cornell's art addresses issues of social justice. He challenges 
        artists of today to forget the self-absorption that has marked the art 
        world of the Twentieth Century, encouraging them to confront the social 
        issues of today. His inaugural lecture, entitled &quot;On 'Nature' and 
        'Good'-An Artist's Reconciliation of Aesthetics and Ethics,&quot; included 
        a quick tour through his years of work as an artist and a look at his 
        interest in how art responds to the world at large.</p>

        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Prof. Cornell also presented slides from his own 
            work from a collection called the &quot;Bather Series.&quot; (Karsten 
            Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p align="left">Cornell's earliest work concentrated on etchings and sketches. 
        These detailed etchings show his immense interest in the organic quality 
        of nature. His first publication, entitled The Monkey, featured similar 
        material, focusing on evolution, a process that Cornell sees as a bridge 
        between society and nature. </p>
      <p align="left">A publication on Frederick Douglass, which Cornell admitted 
        was not an easy thing to accomplish during a time of racial turmoil, dealt 
        more directly with his interest in civil liberties. Further integrating 
        his art with social issues was his 1969 triptych entitled The Dance of 
        Death. This massive work was a response to the war in Vietnam.</p>
      <p align="left">To conclude his lecture, Cornell focused on the &quot;Bather 
        Series.&quot; He showed the audience multiple versions of these classical 
        style paintings and discussed them. One of the primary concerns here was, 
        once again, promoting racial equality. </p>
      <p align="left">Several other themes that Cornell's art has explored were 
        highlighted here: the healthy and happy relationships between family members, 
        especially between fathers and their children. Cornell also focuses on 
        an acceptance of nature's power over human life. These major themes run 
        through Cornell's body of work. </p>
      <p align="left">Recognition of Cornell's talent extends far beyond the Bowdoin 
        campus. He has been the recipient of many prestigious awards including 
        a National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities Fellowship, a Fullbright 
        Grant, a Pollock-Krasner Foundation Grant, and a Louis Comfort Tiffany 
        Award. Before joining the Bowdoin faculty he taught at the University 
        of California at Santa Barbara and Princeton University. On campus, he 
        currently instructs the Painting II and Printmaking II courses every spring.</p>
      <p align="left">The sizeable audience in Kresge represents the appreciation 
        that Bowdoin feels for Cornell, and rightfully so. Thomas Cornell was 
        Bowdoin's first full-time visual arts professor. His concerns for justice 
        and harmony spread far beyond the borders of art, and his influence can 
        be felt in many departments across campus. </p>
      <p align="left">However, his works and their social messages reach far beyond 
        the Quad and into museums and galleries across the nation.</p>
