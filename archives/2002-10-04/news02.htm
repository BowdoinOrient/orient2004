      <p>Brunswick area residents and neighbors of the College have been turning 
        up the intensity of noise complaints against students this fall. Noise 
        has always been an moderate issue for neighbors of the college; but the 
        current level of complaints indicates that it has come to the forefront 
        of their concerns. The integration of the campus into more residential 
        areas is bringing college life to neighborhoods that are not ready for 
        &quot;party&quot; behavior. </p>

      <p>Brunswick Police Department Patrol Commander Rick Dejardins, a leader 
        in the movement to solve the problem, said that the &quot;relationship 
        between the college and the neighbors has always been peaceful up until 
        recently.&quot; This strained relationship is mostly due to weekends where, 
        as stated by Dejardins, &quot;what used to be a single family home on 
        Friday and Saturday night turns into a two or three hundred people event.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>The majority of the noise complaints come from the houses surrounding 
        Garrison Avenue and Harpswell Road. In conjunction with these complaints 
        are concerns from Longfellow Avenue residents that the traffic to and 
        from parties is loud and disrespectful, considering the fact that students 
        are traveling through a residential area late at night. </p>
      <p>The issue of noise complaints is handled first by a call to either Campus 
        Security or the Brunswick Police Department. Generally, Security handles 
        the on-campus problems and the Police Department takes the off-campus 
        calls. After a complaint is filed, the authorities go to the site to evaluate 
        the validity of the call and judge whether the concern is reasonable. 
        If an intervention is required, the members hosting the event will be 
        approached and asked to deal with the issue. </p>
      <p>The ultimate goal of enforcement is to make the noise stop-officials 
        simply want voluntary compliance; however, if students refuse to cooperate, 
        this qualifies as disorderly conduct, a criminal offense. In addition 
        to the issue of noise, traffic to and from parties is a concern to homeowners 
        who feel uncomfortable and unsafe with intoxicated students trespassing 
        late at night through residential yards. </p>
      <p>&quot;This isn't about neighbors angry that someone is having a party; 
        these are really people who are scared in their homes,&quot; Desjardins 
        said. </p>
      <p>The problem of noise and respect is being dealt with on all fronts, and 
        the presence of Campus Security on the streets surrounding the school 
        has been increased for Friday and Saturday nights. Bruce Boucher, Director 
        of Security at Bowdoin, explained &quot;[we] patrol specific areas [where] 
        we know we will run into this problem.&quot; </p>
      <p>The objective in doing this is to remind students to remain quiet and 
        respectful on their trips back to their dorms and apartments. The Brunswick 
        Police Department has also become involved in the intervention, aiding 
        Security whenever necessary. Members of the town are not the only ones 
        raising awareness and seeking a solution to this issue; many students 
        also want to join in the effort so that the disruptive actions of others 
        will not reflect on the school. According to Desjardins, &quot;[people 
        are] concerned the Bowdoin name or Bowdoin relationship in the town is 
        going to be affected by this [problem].&quot; </p>
      <p>Bowdoin Students for Respectful Brunswick-Bowdoin Relations (BSRBBR), 
        a group involved in reaching a compromise to the noise problem, is led 
        by seniors Libby Bourke and Corinne Pellegrini. The group meets with all 
        parties involved to achieve their goal, which according to Dean of Student 
        Affairs Craig Bradley, is to &quot;build some mutual understanding and 
        respect.&quot; According to its members, BSRBBR is interested in getting 
        to the bottom of problem, and helping the campus educate students. Members 
        are looking into working with off-campus residents and helping them build 
        cooperation with their neighbors, in addition to reminding them to encourage 
        their guests to be polite on their walks home. </p>
      <p>Off-campus housing is not the only target of criticism; members are considering 
        a meeting with all College Houses to allow enforcement to establish a 
        relationship with them. Dejardins explained that social houses need to 
        be concerned about their guests' behavior as it is &quot;unacceptable 
        for students here at Bowdoin to essentially ruin it for the whole-to be 
        doing things that are disorderly in the public and then going to social 
        houses in the community [which] essentially [puts] that social house in 
        jeopardy of closing.&quot; </p>
      <p>Ideally, after working with the campus, BSRBBR and other groups hope 
        to create an environment on campus where loud and disorderly behavior 
        is socially unacceptable. Although many steps are being taken to find 
        a resolution to this problem, Bradley remains realistic: &quot;[noise] 
        is an issue that will always be with us [for] students are lively and 
        active and keep different hours from most of the neighbors.&quot; </p>
      <p>Even though pleasing both campus members and town residents is nearly 
        impossible, Dejardins warned that the noise problem &quot;could impact 
        everybody: alums topotential students, this is a big issue-how Bowdoin's 
        reputation carries after this event is going to make a big difference.&quot; 
        For further information regarding this concern, a meeting open to all 
        will be held in Moulton Union at 8:00 PM Wednesday, October 9. </p>
