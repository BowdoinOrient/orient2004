      <p align="left">In a match that would make Mel Gibson's Scottish rebels 
        run for the highlands, Bowdoin fought and battled its way to a 34-18 victory 
        over the University of Maine at Farmington last Saturday. Farmington's 
        scrappy play was not enough to defeat the ruggers in black, as Bowdoin 
        seized victory and advanced to a perfect 2-0 on the season.</p>

            Maine-Farmington's defense in a 34-18 victory. The ruggers improved 
            to 2-0 on the season and are poised to make another run at regionals.

      <p align="left">During their long drive up to Farmington, deep in the hinterlands 
        of central Maine, the Bowdoin ruggers had plenty of time to contemplate 
        the task that lay ahead of them. &quot;Farmington has always been well-coached, 
        and they always give us a game,&quot; said </p>
      <p align="left">Coach Rick Scala before the match, &quot;But if we keep 
        our heads and play with discipline, we should be able to pull out a win.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Still plagued by injuries, Bowdoin arrived in Farmington 
        with several key players sidelined. Captain Dave Kirkland '03 and Joe 
        Wilson '02 were still unavailable, and hooker Kassim Mbwana '02 was sidelined 
        at the last minute due to ankle problems. </p>
      <p align="left">With three important players missing from the pitch, and 
        a hungry Farmington team eager to win its first game of the season, everyone 
        in a black jersey knew that the day's match would not be an easy one.</p>
      <p align="left">Nevertheless, Bowdoin was able to outrun Farmington and 
        take the game by the second half. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We had better conditioning, plain and simple,&quot; 
        said senior Captain Dennis Kiley. &quot;Everyone on the team complains 
        about our running and sprinting practices, but the reason we won Saturday 
        is because we were in better shape. Farmington is a good team, but they 
        lost steam towards the end of the match, and we were able to take advantage 
        of that. Conditioning = victory.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Farmington's strengths - its forwards and the rough play 
        in the rucks - set the tone for the entire match. The highlight of the 
        game came at the beginning of the second half, when Farmington kept the 
        ball within a few meters of Bowdoin's try zone for what seemed like an 
        eternity. </p>
      <p align="left">Ruck after ruck, Farmington tried to break though Bowdoin's 
        defense, and ruck after ruck, Bowdoin held on. At one point Farmington 
        even punched through the Bowdoin forwards and pushed the ball into the 
        try zone, but the crafty Bowdoin ruggers were able to keep the ball off 
        the ground and prevent Farmington from scoring.</p>
      <p align="left">The robust flavor of the game rubbed off on everyone. &quot;The 
        Farmington ruggers were out to start a lot of fights,&quot; said Nick 
        &quot;Kiwi&quot; Reid '05. &quot;I come from a land down under, and in 
        Australia we don't believe in solving our problems with violence. The 
        belligerence on [Farmington's] part was entirely unnecessary.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">Tim Yanni-Lazarus '03, who took over as acting captain of 
        the forwards in Kirkland's stead, was very impressed with the way the 
        team performed. &quot;When you play against a pack like [Farmington], 
        it makes you want to run for the showers and hide. But we rucked hard 
        and we stayed focused, and that made all the difference. Everyone stepped 
        up and did what they were ask to do.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">One of the biggest surprises of the day was Ryan Naples 
        '04, who entered the game at lock for an injured Larry Jackson '05. Naples 
        had been up Friday night due to faulty plumbing in the Tower, and even 
        so he was able to turn in the best game of his Bowdoin rugby career.</p>
      <p align="left">Another surprise performance came from Warren Dubitsky '04, 
        who was able to play hard and finish the match without any head injury 
        of any kind. Unfortunately, Dubitsky was unable to provide any commentary 
        after the game, as he was out celebrating with his good friend and long 
        time companion John Daniels, a senior at the University of Tennessee.</p>
      <p align="left">The B game saw much of the same intensity, but with a fresh 
        crew of Bowdoin rookies to take on the weary Farmington ruggers. Bowdoin 
        fielded a few veterans on the pitch, including Whitney &quot;Flash&quot; 
        Schrader '05, who showed a great deal of leadership. Schrader, known normally 
        for his computer salesmanship, had to assume a more mature role Saturday.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The key against a big team is to be quick,&quot; remarked 
        Schrader. &quot;I told the rookies before the game that Farmington would 
        hit hard, and we needed to do everything at pace. If anything takes longer 
        than a few seconds, it's not worth doing.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">The Bowdoin ruggers will host the University of Maine at 
        Orono tomorrow, before an eager crowd of parents, siblings, friends, and 
        fans.</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Farmington gave us a better game that we thought,&quot; 
        said Coach Scala, &quot;and it was kind of a wake up call for us. Orono 
        is always one of the best teams in the conference, and if we want to win, 
        we are going to have to play better than we have all season.&quot;</p>
      <p>So before your parents take you out for the ubiquitous Maine lobster, 
        bring them down to the rugby pitch at 2:00 PM and help cheer on Bowdoin 
        in its biggest match of the season. GO BLACK!</p>
