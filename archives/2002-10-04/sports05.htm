      </table>
      <p align="left">Coming off a narrow defeat at Colby the previous weekend 
        , the Women's Rugby team gained their first win at Bridgewater State on 
        Saturday. The women won solidly, 22-0, against a very aggressive Bridgewater 
        squad. </p>
      <p align="left">The team expected a rough game when Bridgewater took the 
        field wearing prison-stripe black and white jerseys. Expectations were 
        exceeded when Bowdoin's eager backs felt the first few tackles. </p>
      <p align="left">Quickly, however, Bowdoin retaliated with speed and skill 
        that Bridgewater could not match. Captain Ellie Doig '03 scored the first 
        try in one of her typically dizzying fast breakaways down the field. </p>
      <p align="left">From that point on, Bowdoin easily dominated the game. Bridgewater 
        failed to gain any offensive momentum, due no doubt to the especially 
        vicious tackling of Joanie Taylor '03, Jocelyn Foulke '05, and Emily Angell 
        '04. A few times, however, the mere impetus of the Bridgewater forwards 
        required a joint effort of these unstoppable ladies. </p>
      <p align="left">The forward pack dominated the lineouts, and jumpers Courtney 
        Gribbon '03 and Rachel Hedlund '04 rarely came away empty handed, thanks 
        to the solid throws by Liz Swedock '04. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;When I throw, I look right down my nose at the competition,&quot; 
        commented Swedock '04. One memorable lineout was even punctuated by a 
        glittering green fluorescent light show from the sidelines. </p>
      <p align="left">Scrum half Liz King '03 scored the second try as she peeled 
        off a particularly successful lineout and broke through the tired Bridgewater 
        defense. Said King '03, &quot;I was feeling a little hungry for a try, 
        and I thought I'd eat 'em for breakfast.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">Forwards also notably dominated scrums. Driving low, and 
        always hard, the pack won the majority. Said second-row Gribbon '03, &quot;I 
        think the snazzy new scrum caps have improved my game because I know I 
        even look better than the competition.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">After the half, Bowdoin came out even more energized than 
        before, making Bridgewater pray for refreshments. The Bowdoin back line 
        continued to penetrate the defense, gaining impressive tries for Angell 
        '04 and Doig '03 (again). The free kick after Doig's try was good, upping 
        the score to 22.<br>
        The B side squad offered just as many thrills as the A side and earned 
        a 20-10 victory. The young Bridgewater B side was no less physical than 
        their A side counterparts, but Bowdoin rookies took it in stride and garnered 
        another Bowdoin victory.</p>
      <p align="left">The first half saw the Bears working hard to get clean rucks 
        and good balls, while maintaining a solid defense. Rookie flanker Paige 
        Contreras-Gould '04 jumped in lineouts and gave concrete wins to scrum 
        half Rebecca Guendelsberger '03 and fly half, Rachel Jones '04. The always 
        vocal Jones was heard screaming &quot;Hit me baby, one more time with 
        that ball.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">During the second half, rookie ruggers exploded into the 
        try zone. Mara Partridge '06 busted through the defense to score the first 
        try of the game. Said Partridge of her feat, &quot;I was so excited I 
        thought I might pee my pants.&quot;<br>
        Soon after, Contreras-Gould '04 and Guendelsberger '03 followed Partridge's 
        lead and scored again. While Bowdoin defense was tough, Bridgewater did 
        manage to score, giving them 10.</p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's scoring streak ended when Claudia Marroquin '06 
        snuck by the defense and landed her first career try. The match soon ended, 
        and Bowdoin rejoiced over its two victories all the way back to Brunswick, 
        as many drivers on I-95 can attest. <br>
        The tough Bowdoin squad looks for another victory against Providence this 
        weekend. Team supporter Adam Smith '98, currently at MIT, gave a resounding 
        &quot;Go U Bears!&quot; for their match against Providence.</p>
