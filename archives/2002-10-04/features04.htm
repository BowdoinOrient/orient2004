        <font size="2">TODD JOHNSTON</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font>
      <p align="left">It's humbling yet important to realize just how little we 
        actually know about the world in which we live, until we have traveled. 
        T.S. Eliot once wrote:
      <blockquote><i>We shall not cease from exploration<br>
        And the end of all our exploring<br>
        Will be to arrive where we started<br>
        And know the place for the first time.</i></blockquote>
        
      <p>What's the real allure of Southeast or East Asia? The Great Wall, the 
        Thai temples, and it the beautiful Vietnamese landscape are all impressive, 
        memorable and expected when traveling in Asia. However, the great thing 
        about traveling is experiencing what is unexpected. </p>
      <p>One of the great surprises in traveling to Beijing was that very few 
        of the people we met spoke English. For example, ordering from a Chinese 
        menu in Beijing is not as easy a task as you might think. A restaurant 
        filled with Chinese characters virtually none which speak any English-except 
        for perhaps one waitress taking English 101 at the local university-requires 
        an American to be creative. After several unsuccessful attempts at various 
        restaurants to order chicken and instead ending up with an entire fish, 
        alternative measures were necessary. So we took out a piece of paper, 
        a pencil and put our Bowdoin education to work. When we wanted chicken, 
        we drew a chicken. If we felt for some seafood, we would draw a fish. 
        Pork-a pig. And then there was that very good meal we tried to order a 
        second time after unexpectedly ending up with it the first time. That 
        was beef with green peppers-we drew a cow and a green pepper. Needless 
        to say, drawing somewhat helped to overcome the language barrier-at least 
        enough so we could eat!</p>
      <p>As we ventured south to Thailand, we encountered the capital city of 
        Bangkok-a city, which is constantly on the move. Taxis, motorcycles, buses, 
        cars, trucks, bicycles, pedestrians and of course, the &quot;tuk tuks,&quot; 
        which are motorcycles that carry passengers in a small truck-bed in the 
        back-all are moving at once, seemingly nothing could stop them. Except 
        for one time during the day. At 6:00 p.m. every evening, traffic comes 
        to a halt, people stop what they are doing and everyone remains still 
        in silence and respect as the Thai national anthem plays. As it plays 
        on carefully hidden speakers, for 30 seconds Bangkok is calm, quiet, still 
        and everything it is not during the other 23 hours, 59 minutes and 30 
        seconds of the rest of the day. It's an amazing sight!</p>
      <p>And of course, there was Vietnam. The most frequently asked question 
        I get about Vietnam is, &quot;How were you received as an American?&quot; 
        The answer I always give is, &quot;Very well.&quot; Not only were the 
        Vietnamese friendly toward us as American tourists, but in many ways they 
        were outright kind. I was curious how this could be despite the history 
        of the Vietnam War (which, by the way, they understandably call the American 
        War). How could the reaction from the Vietnamese be so positive toward 
        us as Americans? Was it the fact that we had money? Possibly. Was it because 
        we were very noticeable in a crowd and, as foreigners, interesting to 
        look at? Maybe. Was it because we were from, as many Vietnamese energetically 
        and idealistically call, &quot;AMERICA!&quot;. Definitely. I asked a tour 
        guide why he thought the Vietnamese treated Americans so well despite 
        our countries' history. All he said was that in Vietnam they have a phrase 
        that says you should not dwell on the past but instead think of the future. 
        A welcome response-but not necessarily what I expected to hear.</p>
      <p>Such a realization makes one want to travel more and experience more 
        of the unexpected. After all, sometimes you never know what you might 
        get at a Chinese restaurant in Beijing-and that's the beauty of it!</p>
