      <p align="left"><font size="5">NFL off season: Redskins cleaning up house, Broncos may capitalize</font><font size="5"><br><font size="2">BOBBY DESAULNIERS<br>STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>      <p align="left">The Denver Broncos are always tough competitors in the AFC. But in the last couple of seasons, they have not been able to make the jump deep into the Playoffs.  </p>
<p align="left">The key deal that may change that is the gaining of Champ Bailey from the Redskins in exchange for the letting go of the Broncos for Clinton Portis. The Broncos are recently quite strong, but could use Bailey to help at the cornerback position.  </p>
<p align="left">Last season, the addition of Jake Plummer and the overnight maturity of Portis led the Broncos to a 5-1 start. Granted, Portis was a key part of that streak.  His four-touchdown performance not only exposed a key weakness in the seemingly unbeatable Kansas City attack, but it also distinguished him among the best running backs in the NFL.  Such clout made this rare player-for-player trade possible for the Broncos.</p>
<p align="left">The Broncos have reason to want to release him.  The first, as I mentioned above, is his high profile marketability.  They also have reason to believe that other aspects of their offensive attack can balance off his absence; the first and foremost being the size and skill of the Broncos' offensive line.  Behind Kansas City, their O-Line could be the best in the AFC.  </p>
<p align="left">Over the past decade or so, most running backs that played for the Broncos have succeeded.  The list is extensive: Terrell Davis, 1997 AFC Player of the Year; Olandis Gary, 1999 All-Rookie Team; Mike Anderson, 2000 Offensive Rookie of the Year; and finally Portis, who also earned an Offensive Rookie of the Year title in 2002. </p>
<p align="left">It is clear that the skilled O-line can carry this offense. The loss of Portis would hurt, but running backs like Quentin "Five Foot Assassin" Griffin and Anderson have a future in Denver, behind Portis or not.  </p>
<p align="left">Proof of this came as Portis went down last season with a rib injury.  Anderson gained 80 yards on minimal carries and led the team to a close victory over Detroit.  Later in the season when Portis went down with a high ankle sprain, both Griffin and Anderson flourished.  </p>
<p align="left">To highlight this point, Griffin ran for 136 yards against the AFC Semifinalists Indianapolis Colts. On the ground, the duo totaled 227 yards and three touchdowns without Portis.  The week after, Griffin ran over Green Bay for 114 yards in the Bronco's losing effort.</p>
<p align="left">Also, incentive to let Portis go came during the Pro Bowl when he announced that he might hold out if the Broncos did not up his salary for the last two seasons of his contract.  These factors made Portis a key target for dealing.</p>
<p align="left">One might ask how the Broncos can improve on last year's season. The defense can improve. A recent large contract extension for linebacker Al Wilson locks their linebacker core and co-captain Trevor Pryce holds the defensive line strong at end.  The place they can improve is cornerback.</p>
<p align="left">In two of the losses that Denver suffered this season, the team's defensive backfield was torched.  Against Minnesota, Daunte Culpepper threw for 270 yards and two TDs. Against the Super Bowl Champions New England Patriots, Tom Brady burned them for 350 yards and three TDs.  </p>
<p align="left">Even in the win against the Chiefs, Trent Green threw for 380 yards and a TD.  If a team has Portis to deal, it might as well try for the best cornerback possible.  The best, behind Ty Law of course, is Champ Bailey.</p>
<p align="left">In his five seasons with the Redskins, he has distinguished himself as the biggest defensive back force in the NFC.  The man, who has attended the last three Pro Bowls, covers half of the field every snap and teams base their game plan on throwing around him.  </p>
<p align="left">Bailey, the seventh overall pick in the 1999 draft, had 18 picks in those five seasons while being avoided by offensive coordinators around the league. He has received accolades that include Redskins Player of the Year and also NFL Rookie Player of the Month.  Bailey is the real deal and would be an asset to any squad.  </p>
<p align="left">The Broncos would be smart to pick him up.  Even though the Redskins have franchised him, he wants to get out of Washington.  With an under-performing team with unreal talent, why wouldn't Bailey want to get the hell out of Dodge?  </p>
<p align="left">The future for the Redskins is distant.  For the Broncos, it is now.  Letting go of Portis would hit the Broncos, however infinitesimally, in the short run, but basing their defense around Wilson and Bailey could push the team into late January.</p>
