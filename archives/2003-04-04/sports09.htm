      <p align="left">The past week proved to be a weekend of firsts for the Bowdoin 
        Sailing Team. It marked the first full action of the season with five 
        regattas attended by Bowdoin sailors. Even more importantly, for the first 
        time in Bowdoin history, sailors attended a sloop regatta at the Coast 
        Guard Academy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Four athletes, including Eddie Briganti '05, Justin Berger '05, Sophie 
        Wiss '06, and Davin Michaels '06 competed against some of the top sloop 
        teams in NEISA on J22s, braving heavy winds and strong currents on the 
        Thames River. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although results were mixed, the team will be back there this coming Saturday, 
        in an attempt to fly the spinnaker and perfect their sailing tactics. 
        In addition, the team will be making the shift from dingy sailing into 
        the world of keelboats. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Said Skipper Briganti, &quot;It was a frustrating event-we're still figuring 
        out this keelboat thing, but we're learning, and we had fun out there.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Less than a mile up the Thames River, the coed team sailed to a strong 
        seventh place out of 16 teams at the Vietor Trophy at Connecticut College. 
        Tyler Dunphy '03 and Melanie Keene '03 sailed A-division and had an extremely 
        strong day on Saturday. It was &quot;their wind,&quot; and they took advantage 
        of it with several bullets and top five finishes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ryan Cauley '03 and Gia Upchurch '05 sailed B-division and were also extremely 
        competitive. However, the story changed on Sunday as the sailors faced 
        fierce winds gusting over 20 knots coupled with intermittent higher gusts, 
        pouring rain, heavy current, and choppy waves. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, by the end of the day, the sailors got their boat speed under 
        control. But, the lesson of the weekend was that they need practice in 
        heavy wind conditions.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The women's team braved similar conditions at Tufts University on the 
        first day of its regatta. Allie Binkowski '03 and Jackie Haskell '05 sailed 
        A-division while Laura Windecker '03 and Caitlin Moore '06 sailed B-division 
        at the Duplin Trophy-a very competitive intersectional regatta where they 
        were matched against the top women sailors in the country. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Both boats capsized during the races; however, they righted their dingys 
        and sailed to the finish. While they sailed strong, they were somewhat 
        inconsistent and finished tenth overall as a team. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Binkowski summarized the team's experience and future goals: &quot;It 
        was fierce competition, and you could not let down your guard for a minute. 
        But we are starting to gear up for regattas at Brown in the last two weekends 
        of April, culminating in the qualifiers for nationals.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Two other Bowdoin teams sailed at Boston University this weekend. One 
        group of coed sailors sailed on Saturday at the Metro Series regatta. 
        Bowdoin was led by Pieter Scheerlink '05 and Sabrina Hall-Little '06 in 
        A-division and Elliott Wright '04 and Roberto Hernandez '06 in B-division. 
        The Wright/Hernandez team sparkled with a stellar performance in their 
        first Metro Series event and won several top finishes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        On Sunday, the first-year team traveled to Boston University to compete 
        in the Freshman Series. Frank Pizzo '06 and Whitney Rauschenbach '06 sailed 
        A-division as Emily Bruns '06 and Ellen Grenely '06 strutted their sailing 
        prowess in the B-division, finishing fifth overall. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Enduring freezing rain and shifty winds, the Bruns/Grenely team finished 
        third in their division-the best finish for any Bowdoin boat that weekend. 
        The team will look to Bruns as a shining up-and-coming sailor throughout 
        the season and next year.</p>
      <p align="left">
        This weekend will again find Bowdoin sailors at five events. On Saturday, 
        the sloop team will head to the Coast Guard Academy while the women race 
        at the Emily Wick trophy at BU. The first years will travel to Brown, 
        and the Metro Series sailors will sail out of Harvard. Rounding out the 
        actoin, the coed team will sail their first team-race regatta of the season 
        at Roger Williams. </p>
