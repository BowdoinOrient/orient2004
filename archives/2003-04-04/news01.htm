      <p align="left">For the first time since the commencement of military action 
        in the Persian Gulf, members of the Bowdoin community gathered together 
        to discuss the merits of war in Iraq and its possible consequences on 
        Wednesday evening in Morrell Lounge, Smith Union. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Organized by Professor Allen Springer of the government department, the 
        forum featured Professor Jonathan White of the sociology department, Adams-Catlin 
        Professor of Economics, David Vail and Professor Dov Waxman of the government 
        department, who all led the discussion.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The intent of the evening was to provide the Bowdoin community with a 
        forum for voicing their concerns about the military conflict in Iraq. 
        Professor Waxman said, &quot;Our first goal was essentially to stimulate 
        student conversation about the war. We wanted to make sure that the discussion 
        continued after the break.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        With approximately 200 students packing the floor of Morrell Lounge, there 
        were plenty of opportunities for discussion as multiple members of the 
        community asked questions to each other and the professor panel during 
        the two hour event.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Concerns raised by the members of the panel and the community included 
        the linkages to Iraq and terror, the question of U.S. motives for military 
        action, humanitarian relief during and after the war, and the role of 
        the United Nations.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The professor panel, in an effort to spur discussion, drafted a two-page 
        document with numerous political, economic, and humanitarian questions. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Professor White, in response to a student question about the involvement 
        of the U.N. said &quot;The United Nations is better suited to handle this 
        situation. It is filled with people from Iraq and the Middle East who 
        understand their cultural values.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        After the event, Dan Schuberth '06, a member of BSG, said &quot;It's an 
        issue of national security. Iraq has proven time and time again to ignore 
        the U.N., it's good that the United States has taken the initiative to 
        defend the resolutions that the U.N. has drawn up in the past.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        The second half of the event focused primarily on war-time Iraq and the 
        consequences of war on the country and its population. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Professor Waxman, citing the dangers of military intervention said, &quot;essentially 
        don't trust the United States even if it calls on civilians to leave an 
        area.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        After the event, Sam Cohan '05, concerned about the precedent the United 
        States is setting said, &quot;Invading Iraq just because they might have 
        weapons of mass destruction is like arresting an innocent minority just 
        because they're more apt to commit a crime in an urban neighborhood; it's 
        not fair.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The general consensus after the event remained very positive about the 
        opportunity that the discussion granted to members of the community. Professor 
        White said, &quot;I think that Wednesday night was an excellent beginning 
        of the conversation and I felt some energy in the room toward organizing 
        further events.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, some felt that the forum was not conducive to a real discussion 
        about the war in Iraq due to its one-sided nature. Rebecca Gundelsberger 
        '03 said, &quot;I think we could have found a conservative professor on 
        campus to help lead the discussion as opposed to two leftists and a moderate 
        leftist.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        A friend of Gundelsberger's, Sarah Edgecomb '03 echoed her friend's concerns 
        about the forum and its openness to differing opinions about the war. 
        &quot;I felt like there was a lot of eye-rolling and snickering. People 
        don't take the conservative viewpoint seriously at all.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Other concerns about the forum in terms of the depth of the discussion 
        came from professors and students alike. Some felt that the discussion 
        simply did not delve deep enough into the topics and that the forum simply 
        skimmed the surface of some key issues. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Professor Waxman said the forum was &quot;successful in that it got the 
        community to discuss the war, but it could have used more independent 
        and critical thought.&quot; He also said, &quot;this is a multi-faceted 
        and complex issue which is grossly simplified by slogans which reduce 
        it to a war for oil or a war for Iraqi freedom. It's just that sometimes 
        the level of discussion lost a lot of the nuances and became a course 
        of condemnation against the Bush administration.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nonetheless, the BSG has plans in the coming weeks for a number of different 
        discussions which will be focused on a specific issue about the war-tentative 
        plans call for professor panels in the coming discussions as well. </p>
