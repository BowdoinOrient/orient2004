      <p align="left">But aside from playing host to future officers, Bowdoin 
        College also received a number of distinguished guests during the war 
        years. Foreign dignitaries came across the oceans and somehow found themselves 
        in little Brunswick, Maine. Among them were Andre Michalopoulos, the Greek 
        Minister of Information in exile and Sir Samuel Runganadhan, advisor for 
        India to the British Minister of Foreign Affairs. By far, however, the 
        most popular guest of the war period was none other than First Lady Eleanor 
        Roosevelt. A guest of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity, Mrs. Roosevelt arrived 
        by train on December 12, 1942. Throngs of young Bowdoin men and faculty 
        members dressed in their finest tuxedoes crowded around the First Lady 
        throughout her visit. A group of 200 eager individuals greeted her at 
        the train station and accompanied her to President Sills' house where 
        she dined. The First Lady then took a tour of campus, rested, and joined 
        President Sills, Dean Nixon, Maine Governor Sumner Sewall and other guests 
        for a banquet at the Delta Upsilon House. Mrs. Roosevelt then spoke in 
        the First Parish Church on conditions in Great Britain. &quot;Everyone 
        is fighting the war,&quot; she said, describing British civilians and 
        their amazing efforts to keep support their armed forces and to keep their 
        island empire up and running. Thanking the members of Delta Upsilon, who 
        had been instrumental in bringing the First Lady to campus, President 
        Sills paraphrased British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill by remarking, 
        &quot;It is not often that so much pleasure is given to so many by so 
        few.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        There was to be, during this war, however, much more pleasure. Keeping 
        the spirit of the College alive, administrators also attempted to keep 
        up with tradition. During this period of global crisis, President Sills 
        celebrated his twenty-fifth year in office on April 31, 1942. Faculty 
        and staff members joined students to congratulate the President with an 
        evening of singing and dining at the Moulton Union. As the sun hung low 
        in the sky far to the West of the Bowdoin College campus a crowd of students-so 
        young and still uncertain about their world or their future-came together 
        with smiles, cheers and laughs as if a great reunion was taking place. 
        Forgetting their troubles, whether they be academic or military, for an 
        evening, the men swelled in spirit and in pride as their thoughts concentrated 
        on the fatherly figure who had been the College's head since William DeWitt 
        Hyde's death in 1917. The students began to sing a song that Sills himself 
        had composed for his alma mater and his boys:</p>
      <p align="left"> Rise sons of Bowdoin, praise her fame,<br>
        And sound abroad her glorious name;<br>
        To Bowdoin, Bowdoin lift your song,<br>
        And may the music echo long<br>
        O'er whisp'ring pines and campus fair<br>
        With sturdy might filling the air.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Resounding cheers and shouts filled the air as someone yelled, &quot;We 
        want Casey!&quot; Suddenly, the sentence was picked up and all along the 
        Quad, the plaza between Hyde and Appleton Halls, and in front of the Moulton 
        Union, there was only the crowd and the chanting of &quot;We want Casey! 
        We want Casey!&quot; Surrendering to the admiring crowd President Sills, 
        attired in a fine tuxedo, stepped out from Moulton, acknowledged this 
        gratitude and hoped that better times were in store for his students after 
        the war was ended.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin men, then in the service all over the world, also wrote their 
        congratulations to Sills. In responding to one such letter, the President 
        wrote, half in jest:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Thank you very warmly for your congratulations on my twenty-fifth anniversary 
        as President. I told the students a while ago that I only hoped I would 
        live to see this war through as I had the first war so my administration 
        would not be formally designated-from war to war.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Sills' impressive tenure was not the only great anniversary to be celebrated. 
        On June 24, 1944, Bowdoin College brought out its very best flags and 
        china to ring in its 150th anniversary. Articles about the College were 
        published in many different newspapers-the New York Times declared Bowdoin, 
        &quot;one of the most American of American colleges&quot; and &quot;a 
        champion of liberalism&quot;-and even Times magazine ran an article, which 
        found its way to Bowdoin men all over the world. On the day after the 
        College's grand celebration and annual convocation-in which hundreds of 
        former students, wives, and towns people joined in the festivities-the 
        New York Times again ran an article honoring the College. Noting that 
        only ten students (three more than the first Bowdoin Class to graduate) 
        were graduated at the ceremonies, the Times also spoke highly of Bowdoin's 
        sons in the service of their country-almost 2,200 in total. The New York 
        Times' reporter also obtained two congratulatory letters, which were sent 
        to the College. One was from Lt. Gerhard Rehder of the Class of 1931, 
        who was serving in overseas. It read:</p>
      <p align="left">
        Perhaps it is fitting, too, that a school that has grown up with our Republic 
        should mark its anniversary with so many scattered over the world fighting 
        and working for the preservation of the ideals which the Republic and 
        the college exemplify.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The second letter was from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, where President Franklin 
        D. Roosevelt had entertained Kenneth Sills on at least one occasion:</p>
      <p align="left">
        The fact that Bowdoin has lived and served throughout almost the entire 
        life of the United States gives to its Sesquicentennial celebration unusual 
        significance. It can name among its alumni distinguished leaders in almost 
        every decade of the Nation's history. That is no mean contribution.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The people of this country are grateful for the early establishment of 
        Bowdoin and for its one hundred and fifty years of service. I trust that 
        in the years ahead Bowdoin will not only continue its contributions to 
        the leadership of this country, but will continue to grow in prestige 
        and influence.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Amidst these celebrations, Kenneth Sills must have thought often of the 
        men who were beyond the seas, wishing that they too would be safely home 
        with the college that had been their home. Aside from the normal routine 
        of administrative work, Sills and Nixon also spent tireless hours writing 
        to Bowdoin men in the service. They kept up long correspondences and many 
        of the letters are both touching and speak to the strong relationship 
        that the Bowdoin president and dean had with their boys. &quot;Since Pearl 
        Harbor I have made it a rule to answer every letter I receive from Bowdoin 
        men in the service,&quot; noted the President in a letter. Sills' words 
        went to the far corners of the earth; he wrote to a student: &quot;I believe 
        it is true that the sun never sets now without finding a Bowdoin graduate.&quot;</p>
      <p>To be continued.</p>
