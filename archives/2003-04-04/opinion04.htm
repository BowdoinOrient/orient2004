        <font size="2">CHRISTIAN POTHOLM</font><font size="2"><br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> Bowdoin students, staff, professors and other readers of 
        the Orient might well profit from viewing the current Gulf War through 
        the prism of Karl von Clausewitz. Clausewitz was one of those towering 
        intellects of the 19th century - such as Darwin, Freud, Marx and Hegel 
        - who added so much to our understanding of the human condition.</p>
      <p> Published in 1832, Vom Kriege, (On War), is Clausewitz's magnus opus. 
        For Clausewitz, the essence of war remains a simple contest of wills. 
        While horrible, bloody and revolting, at base, war is still a game, a 
        struggle of wills. For him, there is always the primordial imperative 
        of &quot;I want, you want,&quot; which ultimately depends on the will 
        of the combatants for its outcome. It is will which drives national leaders 
        to war and which sustains them and explains why Saddam Hussein relishes 
        the rate of civilian causalities and George Bush says protesters do not 
        influence his resolve.</p>
      <p> Thus in the present situation, whatever the religious, geo-political, 
        strategic, tactical, personal and ethical elements involved in the war 
        and its prosecution, its essence remains that struggle of wills. George 
        Bush wants to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Saddam Hussein does not 
        want to be removed. The &quot;why's&quot; of each man's position are much 
        less important to the outcome than the strength of their respective wills. 
        Both cannot prevail.</p>
      <p> In today's game theory parlance, this Gulf War is thus a zero-sum game. 
        One leader and his side must win and one must lose. There is no middle 
        ground. There can be no compromise, no negotiated fall-back or negotiating 
        positions. One must lose and one must win because the removal or maintenance 
        of Hussein's regime cannot have a middle ground in terms of outcome.</p>
      <p> As the war goes forward, it is important to keep this firmly in mind. 
        Whatever one thinks about how and why the war started - or even whether 
        it should have started at all - this essential dichotomy is now operative 
        and must prevail. </p>
      <p>The stark choice at this point is simply: should George Bush or Saddam 
        Hussein win? Whose will will crack first? Only one side can win. It doesn't 
        matter how we got to this point, at this juncture only one side can win. 
        &quot;Whom do you want to win?&quot; is thus the most significant of questions 
        asked. Do you want George W. Bush and his regime or Saddam Hussein and 
        his regime to win? </p>
      <p> Now for those of us living in Brunswick and at Bowdoin, this choice 
        seems ridiculously primitive and stark, and so at variance with the way 
        we try to live out lives and interact with our fellows, as to be readily 
        dismissible. Yet Mars is a most jealous god and the way war works almost 
        always overrides our human sense of how a community (even a world community) 
        should operate. The durability of this dichotomy illustrates the true 
        genius of Clausewitz.</p>
      <p> He has many other observations and concepts about war that help us understand 
        its internal imperatives. There are his fog of war, now almost a clich&eacute;, 
        and the very important &quot;friction of war.&quot;<br>
        As for the friction of war, Clausewitz points out that everything in war 
        is at base very simple. Each piece, each action, each portion is simplicity 
        itself. But every thing, even the most simple, is very hard to accomplish. 
        War takes place, he says, in a resisting medium. Tanks break down. Troops 
        fire on their fellows. People get in the way of combatants (either by 
        default or design) and make activities difficult. Bombs fall where they 
        aren't supposed to. Plans always go awry. War is a very hard thing to 
        do and it is especially hard to do according to a plan. War simply has 
        an internal logic and power all of its own.</p>
      <p> Clausewitz would, of course, be astonished at our current ability to 
        see things happening in real time at the squad level (10-12 soldiers) 
        in so many places at one time. But he would have us remember that everything 
        is magnified at the squad level. The fire is more intense, the danger 
        greater, the horror more profound, the perspective constricted, the anxiety 
        heightened. It is almost guaranteed that we lose sight of any larger strategic 
        picture in of the newscasts driven by &quot;breaking&quot; stories. And 
        the talking heads and reporters (from all points of views and in all cultures) 
        are often incredibly wrong in the implications of their first hand observations 
        simply because they too are responding to this local intensity.</p>
      <p>Any reporter of today, standing on the beaches of Normandy on June 6th, 
        1944 would probably have concluded that the Allies had irrevocably lost 
        the war. And, as they waded through the thousands of dead American bodies 
        floating with the tide, the majority would certainly have concluded that 
        the goals of the conflict, however laudatory, were simply not worth it.</p>
      <p> So too is the horror of our current war magnified by the immediate pictures 
        of the dead, the dying, the mutilated and the wounded, especially those 
        of civilians. The more &quot;humane&quot; we are, the harder it is for 
        us to accept some of the iron priorities of warfare. This horror often 
        overrides our rational thought. It seems so de-humanizing and awful that 
        we want to end it by any means to stop the images of human suffering</p>
      <p>Yet for Clausewitz, this view of human suffering can mislead us in our 
        efforts to understand the nature of war and how wars end. The easiest 
        way to end a war, of course, is to lose it by giving up. Ironically the 
        greater suffering, the greater pain to the greater number is almost always 
        caused by lesser measures over time than by the maximum application of 
        force. </p>
      <p>This terrifying imperative, which states that you must be truly cruel 
        in order to be kind, to end the war sooner by applying more force, not 
        less; now, rather than over an extended period, and thus save lives is 
        perhaps the most difficult of his arguments to accept in the post-Enlightenment 
        world. </p>
      <p>Yet it may ultimately be the most profound.</p>
      <p>For in Clausewitzian terms, Ulysses S. Grant was a much better general 
        than Robert E. Lee. He and Sherman and Sheridan knew they must be cruel 
        in order to be kind. They ended the Civil War not by applying less pressure 
        but more. They believed in a &quot;hard war and a soft peace.&quot;</p>
      <p>The present conflict is so disturbing to us because we thought we were 
        beyond all of the implications of warfare. But Mars remains a jealous 
        mistress if not a god, or as Leon Trotsky was fond of saying, &quot;You 
        may have forgotten war but war has not forgotten you.&quot; </p>
      <p>In the weeks and months ahead, it will be very illuminating to keep the 
        basic principles of Clausewitz in mind as we all examine the unfolding 
        war in all its dimensions. <br>
