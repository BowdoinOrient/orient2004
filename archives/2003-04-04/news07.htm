        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is going to have a new 
        face by making significant changes to its format and substance.</p>
      <p align="left">
        According to Jim Miller, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid at Bowdoin 
        said, &quot;To require the SAT would be a significant step in the culture 
        of this place, and we do not have any plans to do that right now,&quot; 
        he said referring to the Bowdoin decision roughly 35 years ago to not 
        require applicants to submit their standardized test scores. He adds, 
        &quot;This is a big change for the SAT and everyone will keep a close 
        eye on it to see how effective it will be.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The specific changes that the College Board is making on &quot;The New 
        SAT,&quot; which is coming out in March 2005, include the addition of 
        a &quot;writing section,&quot; which consists of multiple-choice questions 
        on sentence and paragraph structure and an essay section. </p>
      <p>The essay section is the major new change which &quot;will assess students' 
        ability to write on demand,&quot; according to the College Board's website. 
        The choice of writing topics is still being discussed by the Board, but 
        &quot;the assignment will be persuasive in nature and will ask the student 
        to take a position on an issue and support it with reasons and evidence 
        from his or her reading, experience or observation.&quot; The other changes 
        are less significant. In addition to the writing section, there will be 
        a critical reading section will more reading passages. As a result, the 
        analogy section will be dropped. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the math section, the scope of questions will be expanded to cover 
        not only Algebra I and Geometry but also material from Algebra II.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Miller sees the SAT changes made by the College Board as both &quot;pragmatic 
        and principled.&quot; He notes that the state of California was threatening 
        not to use the SAT any longer in state university admissions processes 
        because it felt it was no longer measuring college potential. So the writing 
        section was added, in principle, to do a &quot;better job of measuring 
        what you actually did in college,&quot; said Miller. Pragmatically, it 
        was to avoid a financial disaster by losing the State of California as 
        an SAT test-taker. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Bowdoin chose not to require applicants to submit SAT scores 35 years 
        ago, acting on the belief that there are more significant ways of measuring 
        a student's collegiate potential through the academic record, rigor of 
        the courses taken, and teacher recommendations among other things.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Alec Schley '06 has concerns that the new SAT changes will shift Bowdoin's 
        admissions focus away from those factors to a numerical depiction of the 
        student. &quot;One of the things I found most appealing about applying 
        to Bowdoin was that it did not require you to submit the SAT scores. Bowdoin 
        looked at the full student and not just a standardized test score.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Miller agrees with Schley's perspective. &quot;The value of the SAT is 
        not measuring aptitude, IQ, or high school performance. The value is to 
        predict how a student will do in college,&quot; Dean Miller explained. 
        &quot;Bowdoin is remarkably good at defining intellectual talent rather 
        than simply relying on test scores to do that for us.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In an age of &quot;teaching for the test&quot; in which schools shape 
        their curricula around test taking methods, the changes in the SAT may 
        have significant benefits for high schools trying to prepare their students 
        for higher education. Miller says, &quot;It will be interesting to see 
        how secondary schools will react. If the test can influence the development 
        of writing skills then that is a very positive thing.&quot; For now, though, 
        in the mind of the Miller, &quot;the jury is still out&quot; as to whether 
        the new SAT will be effective in gauging college potential. For now, Bowdoin 
        has no plans to change its long-standing admissions policy by requiring 
        applicants to submit their standardized test scores.</p>
