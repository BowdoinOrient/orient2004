      <p align="left">&quot;Chris Rock's a funny guy. I mean, come on, have you 
        seen his stand-up? It's not only hilarious, it's also smart. His humor 
        usually means something, you know? That points to something. Michael Moore 
        used a clip from 'Bigger and Blacker' in Bowling for Columbine, for crying 
        out loud! Did you know that won for Best Documentary Feature? The man's 
        no idiot, and he made a movie about a black man running for president&#133;&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        The preceding is my rehearsed defense for having willingly seen Chris 
        Rock's comedy Head of State. It usually breaks down after that Michael 
        Moore thing, once it comes out that I subjected not only myself but also 
        three other innocent bystanders to this torture, or that we were clearly 
        the oldest people in the theater. I should have escaped while I still 
        had the chance. A ditzy girl behind us kicked the chair as she flirted 
        with her junior high crush. Someone shouted a joke worthy only of locker 
        room conversations. Then the lights came down and the truth became all 
        too clear: I had reverted to the movie choice of a 14-year-old.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If this wasn't painful enough, the movie itself only turned the knife. 
        It was like hearing a relative hit all the wrong notes at a piano recital. 
        It was like watching Jackass. It was like hearing long nails scratch a 
        chalkboard while having a bullhorn blare in one ear while wolfing down 
        liver and brussel sprouts. All this from Chris Rock? Oh, the agony. I 
        threw my head back and cried.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Head of State tells the &quot;story&quot; (if that's what you want to 
        call it) of Mays Gilliam, a D.C. alderman chosen as a presidential candidate 
        for the Democratic party after both of the original candidates die when 
        their planes crash into each other. After he is made to read the usual 
        political speeches and make the normal promises in his campaign, Mays 
        decides to let his own voice be heard, launching his popularity as an 
        unconventional but honest candidate. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Other than Bernie Mac, Mays's brother and running mate, no one here is 
        famous, let alone important. As these are all clearly their worst performances 
        to date, their names would be nothing more than blots of ink on this page. 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Usually, this can be blamed on two filmmaking positions: the director, 
        for not using his leadership role to bring out the best in the actors, 
        or at least work the camera around them so they look good, and the writer, 
        for having written an unnatural, unworkable script. Having missed both 
        the director's and the writer's names at the movie, I looked them up when 
        I got home, only to find that my deepest, darkest suspicions were true: 
        it was all Chris Rock.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now, Chris Rock is a funny guy. He's been in other comedies and has done 
        relatively well. And his idea for this movie-having a black man run for 
        office-hey, that has potential. He could have made some good jabs at our 
        racist politics. But, no. Other than some weak pokes at the establishment, 
        the funniest he could come up with was a government division of trained 
        political &quot;superwhores&quot; (which did get some of the film's only 
        laughs) and a joke that &quot;if Michael Jackson were any whiter he would 
        be clear.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        I will give him credit for his efforts. The film did have its moments, 
        and it was easy to tell that he tried to make a warm-hearted, easygoing 
        comedy. I mean, the sappy music was both audible and injected into the 
        right corny scenes. The actors did speak noticeably slower when they whispered 
        sweet nothing clich&eacute;s. I can at least conceive of an audience member 
        crying or laughing profusely, if he's under the age of two. And hey, the 
        14-year-olds seemed to enjoy it immensely. I could see some of their heads 
        bobbing to &quot;Hot in Herre.&quot; &quot;Overplayed&quot; is not their 
        vocabulary.</p>
      <p align="left">
        The bottom line: this was like Steven Spielberg directing Piglet's Big 
        Movie. Anyone who knows Chris Rock's stuff knows he has the potential 
        to do much, much more with the concept and the storyline. That was the 
        most painful thing about it-seeing a well-respected comedian choke. I 
        really have no excuse-no defense. I saw this movie because I wanted to, 
        because it seemed like a good idea at the time. I have learned my lesson. 
        Never trust a trailer.</p>
