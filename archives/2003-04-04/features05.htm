      <p align="left">&quot;Make the noises go away!&quot; I beg silently. My 
        plea, however, is not directed at little voices in my head, but at the 
        almost 100 students in my dorm, who, for the past three nights at exactly 
        10 p.m. have been banging pots and pans in the streets below, in the hallways, 
        and out their windows to protest the war. This culinary cacophony is complemented 
        by various chants of the anti-American sort. While this obviously makes 
        for some awkward moments walking down my hall, it is also an impressive 
        sight to see. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Catalans are among the most politically minded people of all Spain, and 
        often the students are more knowledgeable about U.S. foreign policy than 
        I am. Everywhere we American students go, we become ambassadors of our 
        country-in caf&eacute;s, the park, and even the pubs in Ireland I could 
        not escape the question every abroad student dreads: &quot;What do you 
        think of the war?&quot; Regardless of our own opinions, we know that we 
        will get an earful. While it can feel burdensome at times, it seems as 
        though people are relieved to let America know how they feel, even through 
        such tiny avenues, because they feel as though their protests, ideas, 
        and suggestions are being completely ignored. Almost everyone in Barcelona 
        (91 percent of whom oppose the war, according to a municipal survey) can 
        differentiate between the U.S. government (&quot;assassins&quot; often 
        likened to Nazis) and Americans in general (mostly harmless, with unfashionable 
        taste in shoe wear and a strange penchant for baggy jeans). </p>
      <p align="left">
        This, of course, is very fortunate for me as it is often painfully obviously 
        how un-Spanish I am, from my disinterest in 70s polyester to my breakfast 
        preferences. Along these lines, I advise anyone visiting Spain to bring 
        their own maple syrup if they plan on making pancakes. I did not anticipate 
        such difficulty finding it here--but when the phrase isn't in your dictionary 
        and all you can manage to say at the supermarket is &quot;tree sauce,&quot; 
        it can be pretty hard to come by.</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, for all the strange foods, nocturnal habits, and intense political 
        activism, the longer I am in Spain, the more I realize that our cultures 
        really aren't that different, and that, underneath those 80s legwarmers, 
        they're not so different from us at all. An illustration: I was staying 
        with my Spanish friend's family for the weekend, and while reading a magazine 
        and enjoying the views of the turquoise Mediterranean against swaying 
        palm trees, all of the sudden I hear (in Spanish), &quot;man, Trapped 
        in the Same Day is on T.V. again!&quot; I turn around, and see the all-too 
        familiar image of Bill Murray as a cranky meteorologist in Groundhog&acute;s 
        Day (the title got somewhat lost in translation). After the cumbersome 
        chore of explaining what a groundhog is (does anyone really know?), I 
        realized that this scene has been played out in my house too, be it with 
        Dogma, A League of their Own, or even Ghostbusters II. Often it is easy 
        to get caught up in the minor things different from home, but sometimes 
        all it takes is a cheesy early 90s movie to make you realize that Barcelona 
        isn't quite as foreign as it may seem at first.</p>
