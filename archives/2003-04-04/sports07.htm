        STAFF WRITER</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Nearly three years ago, a Canadian by the name of Simon 
        Whitfield paved the way for a new era of athletics in America. Whitfield, 
        the Olympic gold medallist in the inaugural triathlon competition, brought 
        forth a new wave of excitement and awareness in the sport of triathlons. 
        And this excitement has finally reached Bowdoin College, as the school 
        hosts the first annual Iron Bear Triathlon on May 4. </p>
      <p align="left">
        For many who are unfamiliar with the sport of triathlons, here's a quick 
        outline of a typical one. A triathlon consists of three events, including 
        swimming, biking, and running. Each racer competes in all three events 
        one after the other without rest. The competitor to complete all three 
        events first is the winner. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Race director, Will Thomas '03, describes the format of a triathlon as 
        a grueling race that tests more than just one skill. &quot;Triathlons 
        require strength in all three of events. A winner of a triathlon cannot 
        be good at just one of them,&quot; said Thomas.</p>
      <p align="left">
        It was this aspect of versatility that drew Thomas towards the sport. 
        &quot;I had been doing triathlons since I was 16 years old. Ever since 
        my first one I have been hooked.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Since arriving to Bowdoin four years ago, Thomas has become the person 
        to contact when it comes to triathlons. Students ask him often how to 
        train and the whereabouts of the next nearby race. The growing interest 
        Thomas had been sensing around campus spurred him to investigate the logistics 
        of organizing a triathlon on campus. </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;One day last April, a friend of mine and I talked about putting 
        together a triathlon here in Brunswick. But I didn't take the idea really 
        seriously until this October, when I finally decided I would put my mind 
        to it,&quot; said Thomas.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Now with the triathlon date set and a steady flow of race registration 
        forms streaming in each day, Thomas feels his dream is now a reality. 
        &quot;All the people I have had to contact and work with have been very 
        supportive of my efforts of trying to put this event together. Bowdoin 
        has been incredibly supportive by letting us use facilities to put together 
        the course.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        He added, &quot;Local shops have donated food and prizes for the post 
        race raffle. The Brunswick Recreational Center has lent their support 
        by actively seeking volunteers for race day and handling some maintenance.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As evident by the overwhelming support, Thomas believes that the College 
        and the Brunswick community have grown together. Said Thomas, &quot;This 
        event has been a great way to build bonds between both Bowdoin and Brunswick.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Thomas also hopes that besides just building bonds between the community 
        and College, the triathlon will also become a yearly fundraiser for the 
        town recreational center. &quot;I feel like this is a great way to give 
        back at the community. The money we receive from the race will be donated 
        to the town recreational center to programs that will promote health and 
        fitness.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        When asked about the hours of work that he has put into the creation of 
        this event, Thomas said, &quot;This has been my honors project for the 
        year. I can't wait to see it complete and feel the gratification of knowing 
        I have made my contribution back to Brunswick and the College.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        For anyone interested in either competing or volunteering, more information 
        can be found at the Bowdoin College athletic homepage or by contacting 
        Will Thomas at wthomas@bowdoin.edu.</p>
