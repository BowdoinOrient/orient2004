      <p align="left">N. Joel Moser has recently become the thirteenth Bowdoin 
        College student in history to be selected as a Truman Scholar. Truman 
        scholars are elected on the basis of leadership potential, intellectual 
        ability, and likelihood of &quot;making a difference.&quot; The 76 scholars 
        of 2003 were chosen from among 635 candidates nominated by 305 colleges 
        and universities across the country.</p>
      <p align="left">
        A strong advocate of youth activism, Moser is vocal about political issues 
        including rural health care policy, world perceptions of President Bush's 
        &quot;War on Terror,&quot; and terrorism in general. Furthermore, throughout 
        his Bowdoin career, Moser has been actively involved. &quot;During my 
        freshman and sophomore years at Bowdoin,&quot; said Moser &quot;I worked 
        for a Congressional campaign that was devoted to raising national attention 
        to the health care crisis in Maine and the United States. </p>
      <p align="left">
        I personally saw how profound and astonishingly complex the crisis is. 
        Perhaps the most moving memory on the campaign trail was helping a frail, 
        mentally-ill elderly woman pull open a cargo elevator so that she could 
        find her way back to her room. The home in which she lived was understaffed 
        and the signs of budgetary neglect quickly became palpable for me. The 
        campaign was a major part of my life for over 14 months and helped spark 
        my interest in rural public health policy.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        More recently, and as a result of the current issues with terrorism, Moser 
        has taken a greater interest in the international community and terrorism. 
        Consequently, he decided to &quot;travel abroad to try to better understand 
        this conflict and its implications.&quot; Moser hoped to gain a better 
        understanding of the international view of America as a result of recent 
        events and, having lived in Berlin, Germany ,since September he has witnessed 
        first hand &quot;the gradual erosion of the trans-Atlantic relationships 
        and the growing resentment in Europe of U.S. policy.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Moser further said, &quot;my studies have even led me to a village in 
        central Turkey that was about 350 miles from the Iraqi border, as well 
        as to Bulgaria, Romania and almost all of Eastern Europe. I am not exactly 
        sure what the end result of my research here will be, but I am seriously 
        considering it as a topic for future graduate study.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Currently attending the Humboldt Universit&auml;t and the Freie Universit&auml;t 
        through the International Education of Students program in Berlin, Moser 
        hopes to attend law school in a joint law and public policy degree program 
        and is considering attending law school at Columbia or Harvard, as well 
        as the University of Maine School of Law and the Muskie School of Public 
        Service because of their concentrations in rural health care policy. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Commenting on being selected as a Truman Scholar, Moser said, &quot;It 
        is by far the greatest honor I have ever received. The fact that I was 
        chosen as a Truman Scholar is a deeply humbling experience.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        However, behind his accomplishments, there is also the friend and companion 
        that Moser has been to fellow Bowdoin students throughout his years at 
        Bowdoin. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Emily Scott '04, a long time friend of Moser said, &quot;He is incredibly 
        loyal and loves to play pranks.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        In addition to being a talented political mind, Scott commented that Moser 
        &quot;can do hilarious impressions of people, including Bowdoin administrators.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        &quot;Joel keeps you on your toes,&quot; said Scott. &quot;You never know 
        when he'll surprise you or how, but you can bet that he will eventually.&quot; 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Each Truman Scholarship receives $30,000 for the student's senior year, 
        and $27,000 for graduate study. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Scholars also receive priority admission and supplemental financial aid 
        at some premiere graduate institutions, as well as leadership training, 
        career and graduate school counseling, and special internship opportunities 
        within the federal government. </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Truman Scholarship Foundation was established by Congress in 1975 
        as the federal memorial to our 33rd president, Harry S. Truman. The Foundation 
        awards scholarships for college students to attend graduate school in 
        preparation for careers in government or elsewhere in the public sector.</p>
