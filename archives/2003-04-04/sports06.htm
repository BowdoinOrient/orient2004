      <p align="left">After months of domination and triumph, the Bowdoin Women's 
        Ice Hockey Team ended its prolific season as one of the top three teams 
        in the country. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Goalie Natalie Morgan '06 said, &quot;It takes a lot of determination 
        and commitment to have gotten where we did. As a freshman, I find myself 
        extremely lucky to have been part of this team.&quot; Indeed, though they 
        picked up two losses near the end of the ride, this group of Bears put 
        together an impressive record of 23-2-3. </p>
      <p align="left">
        After defeating in-state rival Colby College 5-0 in the NESCAC semifinals, 
        Bowdoin lost to Middlebury 4-0 in the finals. It was a game of unlucky 
        bounces and great play in goal for Katie Madouras of Middlebury. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Determined to keep their season alive and prove to Middlebury its true 
        dominance, Bowdoin faced the Panthers just a week later in the first round 
        of the NCAA tournament and dealt them a 3-0 loss-a slap in the face of 
        the Panther and their traveling dancing cheerleader. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Blasting a wrist shot into the goal for Bowdoin was Britney Carr '04 whose 
        eventual game-winner in the first period sent a message to Middlebury 
        that the Bears had come to play. Gillian McDonald '04 and Kirsti Anderson 
        '05 added the final two goals to the Polar Bear tally, and Emily McKissock 
        '03 turned away 24 shots for the shutout. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Three-time NESCAC Player of the Week, NCAA All-Tournament selection (Bowdoin's 
        sole representative), fifth in NESCAC in points and assists, second in 
        game-winning goals in the NESCAC, and third grade Spelling Bee champ (this 
        accolade has yet to be verified) Marissa O'Neil '05 said, &quot;I feel 
        in the first [Middlebury] game we didn't catch too many breaks and were 
        not used to being down, so it was difficult for us to catch up. Going 
        into the NCAA quarterfinals, we knew that they weren't going to come to 
        our house and win again. We realized that we couldn't wait for things 
        to happen against such a strong team and that we had to make them happen-that's 
        what we did.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        McKissock added, &quot;Our high point was obviously the last Middlebury 
        game. We played with so much heart to come back from the 4-0 loss-that 
        kind of turn around is incredible. Regardless of the outcome of the season, 
        that was an impressive feat for the team.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        McKissock capped off her stellar career at Bowdoin with her name first 
        on virtually every college goaltending title. Although all the numbers 
        are not in yet, she looks to have the best career save percentage, best 
        career goals against average, most minutes played in a season, most minutes 
        played in a career, most wins in a season, most wins in a career, most 
        shutouts in a season, and most shutouts in a career. Named as a First-Team 
        All-American this year, even McKissock's impressive statistics fail to 
        reflect the determination and domination that she has displayed for the 
        team in her four years of play. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Following the emotional Elite Eight triumph over Middlebury, the Bears 
        traveled to Elmira to face Manhattanville in the Final Four. Though Bowdoin 
        lost by a score of 4-1, the Bears held their heads high as their season 
        officially ended. McKissock made 34 saves in the defeat, and senior Alyson 
        Lizotte scored the final goal of her career. </p>
      <p align="left">
        In the consolation match the next day, Bowdoin defeated Wisconsin-River 
        Falls 4-2. Said Anderson, &quot;We don't need NCAA watches or first place 
        trophies to know that we were the best in the country this year. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Any team can win on any given day, and unfortunately it was Manhattanville's 
        luck to pull off a win against us. I'm just glad we were able to finish 
        our season with a really strong win against River Falls.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        McKissock said, &quot;The Manhattanville game was a matter of size and 
        strength I think-things we have been working on a lot, but are not the 
        only focus of our program.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Scoring for the Polar Bears against Wisconsin-River Falls were O'Neil, 
        Leah McClure '03, Nicki Young '06, and McDonald. Said McDonald, &quot;This 
        year was another great year. It truly is magical and such an honor to 
        represent your school at the Final Four. When you are there you feel an 
        enormous amount of pride for your school and your teammates. The NCAA 
        really does put on a great show, and they deserve a huge round of applause.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        First Team All-American Beth Muir '03 said of the experience, &quot;It 
        was great to be there again, and it always feels good to win the last 
        game of the season and for some of us our careers!&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Looking back on her first two seasons in the program, O'Neil said, &quot;The 
        past two years we look back on these experiences, and they have been a 
        lot of fun, but our level of play didn't show the hard work we put in 
        all year, so I would say when you are playing at that level you want to 
        make sure you don't have any regrets when its all over.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        Two-time First-Team All-American Shelly Chessie '03 succinctly added her 
        advice to future teams competing for a national championship: &quot;Don't 
        lose.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the Bears say &quot;au revoir&quot; to McKissock, Muir, Chessie, Lizotte, 
        McClure, Ba Lanoue, Francesca &quot;Frankie&quot; Klucevsek-Whalen, and 
        Kirsti Anderson, those remaining look forward to continuing to build onto 
        the legacy left behind by these amazing players. </p>
      <p align="left">
        All the supporters of this year's team offer up a huge thank you to the 
        team and, reciprocally, the team would like to thank all the loyal parents 
        and fans for their contributions and faithfulness throughout the successful 
        season.</p>
