        <font size="2">J.P. BOX</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The problem with Allen Iverson is that he just doesn't fit 
        in. Take one look at him, and you know that he doesn't belong in the NBA. 
        Listed at a generous six feet and 165 pounds, he plays a game with men 
        who outweigh him by 100 pounds and stand a full foot taller. But it doesn't 
        matter -A.I. is simply the greatest basketball player in the world.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Relying on his heart as much as his talent, Iverson plays basketball with 
        reckless disregard for his wellbeing. Most players his size would never 
        play shooting guard-he's too small, too fragile, too skinny to take it 
        inside. He should be playing the point, dishing out ten assists per game 
        and dropping in 15-20 points from the perimeter.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But not Iverson. He can't resist the temptation to slash inside and float 
        a lay-up over the out-stretched hand of whichever Goliath occupies the 
        lane on any particular night. It's not enough that he has the quickest 
        first step in basketball-he continues to accelerate as he approaches the 
        basket.</p>
      <p align="left">
        As the defense collapses, he becomes a magician with the basketball, finding 
        some creative way to squeeze off a seemingly impossible shot. Kobe Bryant 
        and Tracy McGrady attack the basket with the same vigor and make the impossible 
        look easy with a stylish reverse or an emphatic dunk.</p>
      <p align="left">
        But not Iverson. Everything he does on the basketball court looks difficult. 
        When you're under six feet tall in the NBA, nothing comes easy -not the 
        career 27.0 points-per-game average, 5.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds, or 2.4 
        steals. Out of the 12,925 points that A.I. has scored in seven seasons, 
        few have come easy for the undersized shooting guard. The man simply outworks, 
        outplays, and outsmarts his competitors, night in and night out.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Playing perhaps the finest basketball of his career, Iverson has single-handedly 
        pushed the 76'ers into the third spot in the improved Eastern Conference. 
        Without A.I. leading the charge, Philly would be praying for lucky ping-pong 
        balls in the LeBron James sweepstakes. Instead, Larry Brown's team is 
        contending for a NBA title.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Despite performing at a higher level on a consistent basis than any other 
        player in the NBA, Iverson is in danger of being left off the 2004 USA 
        Olympic Dream Team-for reasons completely unrelated to basketball.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Larry Platt, author of Only the Strong Survive: The Odyssey of Allen Iverson, 
        wrote the following in a recent ESPN Page 2 column: &quot;If Allen Iverson 
        is passed over for the 2004 U.S. Olympic team, it will be a missed opportunity-and 
        not just for him. It will be bad for the game, because, as Iverson himself 
        suggests, it will fly in the face of a traditional American value: merit.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Remember, the problem with Allen Iverson is that he just doesn't fit in. 
        In a book entitled Beyond the Cheers: Race as Spectacle in College Sport, 
        C. Richard King and Charles F. Springwood offer a provocative analysis 
        of the prototypical sports star: &quot;&#133;these new African-American 
        stars are nonthreatening, insofar as they generally avoid political activism, 
        especially black politics, and they are represented as the cultural peers 
        of white America.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Iverson does not fit this mold-nor does he try. He may be the single best 
        basketball player in America, but he is by no means the cultural peer 
        of white America. His general style and self-presentation stand in stark 
        contrast to that of a Michael Jordan-or a Ray Allen, the player who was 
        awarded Iverson's spot in the 2000 Olympics. </p>
      <p align="left">
        No disrespect to the Sonic's newest shooting guard, but Iverson is a more 
        dynamic and influential player on the basketball court. Allen may have 
        the sweetest jump shot in the NBA, but his offensive creativity pales 
        in comparison to that of Iverson's. In 2000, Allen may have been a more 
        polished all-around player. </p>
      <p align="left">
        However, you cannot make the same argument in 2003. With a MVP season 
        and a NBA Finals appearance under his belt, Iverson has proved his worth 
        on the court and has certainly proved his status as one of the game's 
        twelve best.</p>
      <p align="left">
        After finishing sixth in last year's World Championships, USA basketball 
        needs the hustle and skills of Iverson more than ever. In 1992, the USA 
        sent the 12 best basketball players in the world to Barcelona. In 2004, 
        the selection committee might send a blend of the 12 most talented but 
        non-threatening ballers in America. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Iverson is right to question the meritocracy of the upcoming selections. 
        Based on merit, Iverson is, without a doubt, deserving of a roster spot. 
        However, as he very well knows, the upcoming decision may not be based 
        solely upon his abilities -it may come down to style and presentation.</p>
      <p align="left">
        If the game's most inspirational player is declined a roster spot, it 
        will be an unprecedented and outrageous insult. In effect, the message 
        that will be sent is that his cornrows and tattoos outweigh his prodigious 
        talents.</p>
      <p align="left">
        Does the NBA and USA Basketball believe that another embarrassing sixth-place 
        finish is preferable to having Allen Iverson represent the United States? 
        Before passing over the Answer in 2004, the NBA better think long and 
        hard about what it is trying to hide from the world-a man who is as passionate 
        and dedicated to basketball as he is skilled; a man who deserves to represent 
        the United States.</p>
