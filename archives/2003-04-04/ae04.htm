      <p align="left"><b><i>Four stars out of five</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">Jack White, high school misfit and veteran of one divorce, 
        has written an album dedicated to, and written for the &quot;sweetheart.&quot; 
        To define what he means by &quot;sweetheart,&quot; he dedicates two pages 
        of liner notes to a written rant on how media and societal trends (he 
        relegates his sharpest barbs for lottery tickets and uber-caffeinated 
        soft drinks: &quot;societal trends&quot; that only happen inside 7-11) 
        have destroyed puppy love. Meaning, the sweetheart is anything other than, 
        &quot;the thirteen year old tattoo, the hard attitude, devil may care, 
        don't call your parents, drink, insult, thank only yourself, and blame 
        the rest if you don't get yours.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">
        Albums these days rarely carry such credos, especially as explicitly as 
        Elephant does. While we might understand something of what Radiohead tries 
        to do with their ironic song titles, sterile graphic design and socially-laced 
        lyrics, Thom Yorke and his bandmates have never exactly told us what they 
        are reacting against. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Jack White is hardly so bashful or so subtle and some of the strength 
        of the White Stripes' third album lies in White's dedication to the concept. 
        There are no cheap, radio-friendly filler songs that sort of sound like 
        last year's hit, &quot;Been in Love with a Girl,&quot; nor are there any 
        sneering, blues-mired messages that might appeal to the hip crowd that 
        follows bands like the Liars or the Strokes. </p>
      <p align="left">
        If nothing else, Elephant is earnest and it is reactionary. Lyrics compiled 
        together, it carries an almost embarrassingly open vision of winsome innocence 
        and all that is good about falling foolishly in love. This is White's 
        sweetheart: the sweaty-palmed teenage dirtbag with the dozen roses in 
        his right hand about to ask the head cheerleader out to the prom. Before 
        he learns that she's an awful person, before he comes to understand that 
        he only seeks out in others what he lacks himself, before he reads the 
        Tao Teh Ching and before he learns in college that romantic love was a 
        creation of the 14th Century. Elephant is a eulogy to this icon, and White's 
        voice-which ranges from plaintive to tortured- perfectly reflects the 
        dizzying emotions of the age and the experience. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Although they draw much of their sound out of the electric Detroit blues, 
        Elephant displays the Stripes' first effort to break out of just being 
        highly-wired, lo-fi rockers. Meg White sings a song on this album and 
        the Stripes even condescend to include a bass in a couple tracks. </p>
      <p align="left">
        Much of the steely guitar is gone and replacing it is thoughtfully spaced, 
        sparse guitar and more subdued vocals. Although it's refreshing to see 
        a band trying to grow musically, some of this experimentation is of detriment 
        to the album. Unlike White Blood Cells and even DeStijl, both of which 
        were fueled by wild guitars and driving drums, Elephant has a tendency 
        to drag in certain spots, (&quot;There's no home for you here,&quot; and 
        &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; are particularly boring) which might turn 
        away some fans who listen mostly to get a hip charge. </p>
      <p align="left">
        There are points where the attention to minimalism does not work and there 
        are even times when White's crunching guitar sounds a bit stale. However, 
        these rather small blemishes are overwhelmed by White's unfathomable charisma 
        and his innovative songwriting. (There is not a single chorus on Elephant) 
        </p>
      <p align="left">
        Many critics have labeled White as &quot;retro&quot; and his sound as 
        &quot;garage.&quot; As proof, they point to the seventies crunch of White's 
        power chords, the antiquity of his recording equipment (Elephant was recorded 
        on an eight-track reel-to-reel that went out-of-date in the late sixties) 
        and small, seemingly petty messages in his liner notes such as, &quot;No 
        computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing or mastering 
        of this record.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">
        What these critics miss is that there is a difference between being stylishly 
        retro and attempting to reclaim a lost era for reasons other than style. 
        The White Stripes, unlike the bands that they are so often erroneously 
        compared to, do not dress like the Velvet Underground. They wear white 
        and red silk suits that defy category. They do not prattle on endlessly 
        about iconic, obscure jazz legends that are their heroes. What they have 
        tried to do with Elephant is create a time bomb aimed at reminding their 
        mod-haired fans that the principles of their youth are better than the 
        concessions they've made in their young adulthood. This is a different 
        &quot;retro&quot;-one rooted in emotion rather than fashion and it certainly 
        deserves its own space and definition. </p>
      <p align="left"> If anything, Jack White's songs are children's songs for 
        jaded adults that inspire the same, strange time-bending sentiment that 
        is stirred when we look through baby pictures or read over old diaries. 
        However, unlike those personal relics whose appeal is steeped mostly in 
        nostalgic navel-gazing, (Look how cute I was in this photo!), Elephant 
        draws out a more profound sort of looking-back, where ideas of maturity 
        are cast off as callousness and innocence is not merely something to lose. 
        As Jack White himself sings in one of the album's most satisfying tracks, 
        &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot;: &quot;Don't you remember, you told 
        me in December that a boy is not a man until he makes a stand. Well, I'm 
        not a genius, but maybe you'll remember this. I never said I wanted to 
        be a man.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left"><b><i>The whole sentiment: Two stars out of five</i></b></p>
      <p>It's not that Jack White is wrong, or even being hopelessly na&iuml;ve. 
        I mean, it's nice to look fondly back, only see the greenest peaks of 
        happiness, and write off your youth as some lost Shangri-La. But, really 
        when you think back at those years, things probably weren't as sweet as 
        you might remember. <br>
        Maybe if you were one of those kids whose entire life consisted of hitting 
        home runs in the bottom of the ninth, watching He-Man, building snow forts, 
        winning pinewood derbies, and kissing the hot girl behind the bleachers, 
        you'd have some license to write an entire album's worth of songs about 
        regaining that time in your life, but most of us spent our childhoods 
        accidentally peeing ourselves and being bored. <br>
        Remember 4th grade? Yeah, that sucked and it wasn't like 5th grade was 
        a week at Bikini Space Camp either. 6th grade? Boring. 7th grade? Humiliating, 
        but boring at the same time. And so it goes on.<br>
        It's not that you should only dwell on the negative, it's just that you 
        should be fair. For every time you talk to someone about how much Transformers 
        ruled (which it did), you should have the decency to not carry on and 
        say, &quot;Yeah, and remember Thundercats? That ruled!&quot; because Thundercats 
        sucked. So did The Cabbage Patch Kids and so did your mom back then. <br>
        It's like playing that game where you try to name players off of old baseball 
        teams and you're doing the '86 Red Sox and you go, &quot;Yeah, Dwight 
        Evans ruled,&quot; and that a**hole next to you goes, &quot;Yeah, Calvin 
        Schiraldi. Remember him? He ruled.&quot; That a**clown who says Cavlin 
        Schiraldi rules is just trying to elevate anything from his childhood 
        into a solid gold memory and forgets that it was really Calvin Schiraldi's 
        fault that the Sox lost Game 6 of the '86 Series and that in addition 
        to being a sweaty short man, Calvin Schiraldi just wasn't very good at 
        baseball.<br>
