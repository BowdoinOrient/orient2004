      <p align="left"><font size="5">Chabotar: bound to go down in academic fame</font></p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>In 1991 former President Edwards called Kent Chabotar, a 22 year veteran 
        public finance professor, at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government to 
        offer him the position of Bowdoin College Treasurer. Chabotar then paused 
        and then politely demanded an improvement to Edward's offer: he would 
        come to Bowdoin only if he were allowed to continue to teach part-time. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Each spring semester since then, Professor Kent Chabotar, or Kent as 
        many of his students know him, has taught a course - either the introductory 
        Government 215 or his senior seminar, Government 370 - on public policy 
        and fiscal administration in addition to his duties as Treasurer of the 
        College. Kent's bravado and expertise leaves no doubt among his students 
        that teaching is much more than a part-time pursuit - it is his true passion. 
        None of the 60 students who fill his Public Policy class each spring to 
        capacity can escape notice by slouching in their chairs and hiding in 
        the corners of Druckenmiller 16. Instead, Kent's uncanny ability to draw 
        intelligent participation from each member of the class makes for lively 
        discussion and distinguishes Kent as a master of the Socratic method. 
        As Treasurer, Kent is able to bring into the class a hands-on experience 
        and intimate familiarity that too often is missing from the halls of academia. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps most importantly, Kent's passion for teaching extends far beyond 
        the confines of the classroom. His tenaciousness in reaching out to students 
        and the honest interest and care he shows to their well-being and future 
        keeps students visiting him long after the final exam. It is a rare occasion 
        when Kent travels out of town with out stopping for dinner with a former 
        student and disciple of Government 215. Kent's reach into the student 
        body is by no means limited to those that take his classes, as he has 
        always been eager to take students on as academic advisees or in independent 
        study projects. Finally, as a long-time faculty advisor to student government, 
        Kent has most recently for the past two years led a weekend leadership 
        retreat for the E-9.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As the article in this issue explains, Kent will leave Bowdoin in June 
        of 2002 after an 11-year tenure as treasurer that included 10 balanced 
        budgets and a resurgence of fiscal discipline and vigor. If one judges 
        a professor's success by his enthusiasm and efficacy in engaging students, 
        then after Kent teaches Government 215 for the final time this upcoming 
        spring, his name will undoubtedly rest among Nat Danes, Leroy Greason 
        and the other famed professors who have left their marks on Bowdoin. The 
        writers of this letter, on the other hand, seriously doubt that he himself 
        will rest long before once again entering the classroom as a professor.

      <p><font size="5"><a name="ltr02"></a>Vote yes on 1</font></p>
      <p>To the Bowdoin Community,<br>
      </p>
      <p>On next Tuesday's ballot there is an important environmental question: 
        whether to enact the Coastal Protection Zone Amendments. This measure 
        will limit development in order to protect the health of Maquoit Bay. 
        I urge you to vote yes on this question.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maquoit Bay is located a mere two miles from Bowdoin's campus. It is 
        a beautiful place and a precious natural resource. But more and more houses 
        are being built in the watershed area of the bay. If development in this 
        area is allowed unchecked, excess nutrients from numerous septic systems 
        could lead to explosive plant growth, which can cause a catastrophic depletion 
        of oxygen. This in turn could kill the marine life in the bay.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Coastal Protection Zone Amendments will place reasonable limits on 
        the number of houses and septic systems that can pour pollutants into 
        the bay. The amendments are our best bet for preserving a healthy bay.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Coastal Protection Zone Amendments were the product of a local citizens' 
        Task Force, and they are based upon the research and knowledge of a number 
        of Bowdoin scientists. The amendments were recommended unanimously by 
        the Brunswick Planning Board, and they were approved by the Brunswick 
        Town Council. The issue is on the ballot now because a group composed 
        largely of realtors and local property development interests has forced 
        a referendum. Many of the opponents stand to profit from development in 
        the watershed area. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Brunswick is your community now, and Maquoit Bay belongs to you. Help 
        protect it by voting Yes on Question 1 on Tuesday, November 6. <br>

      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>My colleagues Ta Herrera and Rick Freeman did an excellent job of explaining 
        the importance and complexities of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in 
        last week's Orient. However, their stress on flaws in the Kyoto Protocol, 
        viewed from a narrow economic perspective, had two unfortunate effects. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>First, they let President Bush off the hook for repudiating an international 
        agreement reached after years of arduous multilateral negotiations with 
        compromises on all sides. Perhaps Bush's unilateralism was intended to 
        gain bargaining leverage in future negotiations; but it sent a terrible 
        message -- play by our rules or we won't play -- which could set negotiations 
        back years. Fortunately, the National Academy of Sciences has responded 
        to Bush's &quot;what me worry?&quot; stance by strongly confirming that 
        human-caused warming is happening and is serious.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Second, Herrera and Freeman overlook what is arguably the Kyoto Protocol's 
        most important contribution, while misrepresenting key features as flaws. 
        In critiquing the Protocol's economic costs relative to its environmental 
        benefits, they fail to acknowledge that its signal &quot;benefit&quot; 
        is not about specific abatement targets or policy instruments. Rather, 
        it is building a new international governance regime and convincing industrial 
        nations to relinquish sovereignty for the sake of crucial, long term global 
        objectives. President Bush denied that responsibility.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Their contention that the Protocol &quot;did not call for enough reduction 
        of greenhouse gas emissions&quot; ignores the obvious: the 2010-12 targets 
        are just a first installment on larger reductions. They contend that &quot;it 
        tried to do it too quickly, thereby imposing higher costs..than were necessary.&quot; 
        The point about costs is well taken. However, agreeing to substantial 
        early reductions had diplomatic and symbolic importance justifying an 
        economic efficiency tradeoff. Further, post-Kyoto negotiations were leading 
        toward more cost-effective measures. </p>
      <p>Finally, they contend that &quot;it did not require any actions now or 
        in the future by any developing nations.&quot; Leaving aside the added 
        complications of bringing poorer nations into an already very complex 
        process, it is not equitable to &quot;require&quot; them to take immediate 
        action. In any case, the proceedings make clear that the Third World will 
        be part of future mitigation strategy.</p>
