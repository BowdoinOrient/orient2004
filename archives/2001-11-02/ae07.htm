      <p>Priest Wine, a compilation of three original one act plays written and 
        directed by Scott McCabe '02, bursts upon the public stage and gives audiences 
        a peek into the world of the &quot;unconventional.&quot; McCabe promises 
        an &quot;absurd look at family&#133;a little bit of humor, a dash of drama, 
        and a couple of tears.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The play is the result of an independent study in theater and was advised 
        primarily by Gretchen Berg, Adjunct Lecturer in Theatre Performance. Berg 
        commented that McCabe has &quot;synthesized his understanding of&#133;performing 
        elements in an extremely personal and off beat hour of theater.&quot; 
        She added that she couldn't wait for the performances and said, &quot;I 
        respect his process and adore his point of view.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Inspired by an evening when McCabe's &quot;roommate wound up in a leotard,&quot; 
        the piece of work was originally entitled Priest Wine and How We Got My 
        280 lb Roommate into a Leotard. For purposes of clarity, however, the 
        title was shortened to Priest Wine.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The cast of four men and four women is a mix of &quot;goofballs&quot; 
        and &quot;veterans of the Bowdoin stage.&quot; Although this combination 
        was somewhat challenging for first-time director McCabe, it also proved 
        interesting and, at times, amusing. Ben Vandivier '02, who plays the patriarchal 
        figure in two of the segments, described the cast as &quot;daring.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Not having been on stage as an actor since eighth grade, Vandivier appreciated 
        the chance that the play gave him to &quot;break down social constraints.&quot; 
        He found the whole experience &quot;cathartic&quot; in that it liberated 
        him from his preconceptions about acceptable public behavior. As a rookie 
        actor, he was forced to learn how to immerse himself in a character and 
        let go of modesty and reserve.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Although the director takes himself seriously, he inserted a unique visual 
        teaser into each of the three segments. In each one act, there will be 
        some form of a visual representation of Superman-in the shape of anything 
        from a pose to a symbol of this comic book hero. &quot;It's kind of like 
        Where's Waldo,&quot; said McCabe. The director also said there is no specific 
        significance to the Superman aspect of the play besides the fact that 
        Superman was the first comic book he read. However, the absurdity of the 
        Superman bit seems appropriate considering the eccentric nature of the 
        director and writer of this piece of work. </p>
      <p>At many moments during the interview McCabe seemed, ironically, at a 
        loss for words. One could only conclude from his silences that the play 
        is so fantastically avant-garde that it is indescribable. Not wanting 
        to reveal too much about his play, McCabe cryptically informed the public 
        that &quot;no one can be told what Priest Wine is--you have to see it 
        for yourself.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The play will be performed at Wish Theater at 7:00 p.m. on November 1, 
        2, and 3.</p>
