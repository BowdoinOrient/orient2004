      <p>Dean of Admissions James Miller continued a trend on Wednesday when he 
        denied the existence of an athletic-academic divide at Bowdoin College. 
        In doing so he disputed last month's NESCAC report on the &quot;Academic-Athletic 
        Divide,&quot; as have many other administrators and coaches at Bowdoin. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Miller stated outright that Bowdoin does not accept students due to their 
        athletic prowess who would not otherwise be admitted. While not leveling 
        any accusations, Miller did add, &quot;I think one of the problems with 
        the report is that it tends to blanket all of the NESCAC schools.&quot; 
        He echoed the sentiments of football coach David Caputi who earlier said, 
        &quot;Everybody we're playing with isn't playing by the same rules.&quot; 
        Miller was quick to point out that all of the NESCAC schools are extremely 
        selective (Bowdoin accepted less than 25% of its applicants last year) 
        and that they all operate under similar processes. He declined to get 
        into any further comparison of Bowdoin's admissions processes with her 
        NESCAC competitors citing his short time on the job, a mere three months.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Miller indicated that the admissions office works closely with the athletic 
        department throughout the recruiting process so that there will be no 
        confusion as to which students are admissible. Miller added, &quot;If 
        a recruit isn't admissible we tell them that and they move on. This insures 
        that the academic talent necessary to succeed at Bowdoin is present.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Miller coaches are allowed to be proactive in their recruitment 
        of athletes, up to a point. &quot;Obviously they can't go on visits or 
        anything else that's prohibited by DIII statutes, but they can otherwise 
        be in contact with athletes.&quot; While there is no set number of students 
        that coaches pass along, the admissions department is aware of the needs 
        of various teams and attempts to work with coaches to fill those needs.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The only real difference between athletic recruiting and the recruitment 
        of other students-musicians, students from Maine, students of color, National 
        Merit Scholars, and otherwise academically gifted students-is that coaches 
        act as a second layer of recruiters after the admissions staff, a luxury 
        not afforded to other groups. &quot;We have chosen to make sports and 
        important part of the college experience at Bowdoin&quot; said Miller, 
        &quot;and this subset of recruitment has developed out of that decision, 
        much as it has at many other institutions around the country.&quot; &quot;Our 
        first and primary goal&quot; he continued, &quot;is to recruit and recognize 
        excellence across the board.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin's campus is an athletic one; the viewbook boasts that over 80% 
        of the student body participates in a sport of some nature-be it varsity, 
        club, or intramural. Of the most recent class, approximately 300 of the 
        450 students were varsity athletes in high school. Miller feels that athletics 
        are a positive part of student life at Bowdoin, &quot;We believe in a 
        sound mind, sound body approach&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While Miller took a strong stance on the issue of giving athletes an 
        advantage in admissions he was comfortable with other aspects of the report. 
        &quot;It's good to go back and look at ourselves. I think that the report 
        addresses good questions that are central to what NESCAC stands for.&quot; 
        He was not alone in this respect as Dean Bradley and McEwen, as well as 
        President Mills have all made similar comments since the release of the 
        report.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Citing once again the fact that he has only been in his current position 
        at Bowdoin for three months, Miller said that he had no real way to judge 
        the report any further. For the same reasons, he indicated that he has 
        no immediate plans to overhaul or otherwise change the admissions process 
        at Bowdoin. Miller did say that he would like the College to continue 
        to become more diverse both culturally and geographically and that he 
        feels that alumni are underutilized as a resource for recruiting all types 
        of students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The general consensus among administrators, coaches, and students, as 
        evidenced by the Orient's ongoing coverage of this situation is that while 
        Bowdoin is not doing anything particularly wrong, the report raises interesting 
        questions that need to be addressed. This is especially so if the College 
        is to remain true to the principals set forth by the NESCAC charter which 
        states, &quot;Its members are committed first and foremost to academic 
        excellence and believe that athletic excellence supports our educational 
        mission.&quot;<br>
