        </font></p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a former prosecutor came to Bowdoin to discuss hate 
        crimes. He told us heart-wrenching stories of individuals assaulted both 
        physically and verbally simply because of their race, ethnicity, or gender. 
        Bowdoin, and most institutions of higher learning, have in place procedures 
        and protocols that address incidents that involve hateful or insensitive 
        speech. Here at Bowdoin it is called the Bias Incident Group. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, one recent incident at Amherst College should make one wonder 
        whether these enforcement bodies have a bias against protecting the rights 
        of certain ethnic groups. Perhaps some have read accounts of the flag 
        burning protests that took place at the end of a &quot;support our troops&quot; 
        rally at Amherst. Amherst President Tom Gerety wrote that burning the 
        flag is &quot;an extreme form of expression&quot; but said that such actions 
        must be tolerated in a free society. I find his response reassuring when 
        placed in the broader context of hate crimes and speech codes often found 
        at many institutions of higher learning. However his real test is how 
        he would react if the protesters burned a cross, a star of david, or any 
        other religious or ethnic symbol. It should be no different.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Somehow the American Flag, a symbol of the values that thousands of American 
        men and women have died to protect, is often not treated with the same 
        respect by courts and University administrators as other religious and 
        ethnic symbols. The 6,000 people who died on September 11th died because 
        they were Americans. Therefore, one would think that &quot;Americans&quot; 
        could be considered a protected ethnic group. If that were the case, then 
        certainly flag burning would be considered a hate crime, because the flag 
        is a venerated symbol of our culture. <br>
      </p>
      <p>However, the Supreme Court has rightly ruled that Flag Burning is legal. 
        I believe one of the fundamental values that the flag protects is the 
        right of people to make offensive, albeit peaceful, demonstrations, which 
        includes the desecration of the flag. This protection must include everyone, 
        even those whose hateful opinions we find rightfully reprehensible. This 
        fundamental freedom of expression must hold true whether we are in the 
        Brunswick Town Commons or on the Bowdoin quad. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The fact is that hate crime legislations do not consistently protect 
        all groups who might be offended. Would we really want a speech code that 
        protected every group from being offended? That would hinder all forms 
        of expression. Hate crime laws exist on the premise that one can legislate 
        people's thoughts. This is impossible. Assault and harassment are crimes 
        whether or not it is done out of hate for a group. Changing people's prejudices 
        can only be accomplished through education, not legislation. This is where 
        it is essential that schools focus on teaching what Aristotle called &quot;moral 
        virtues&quot; or what we call &quot;right from wrong.&quot; This is where 
        we overcome the roots of prejudice and hate, not in the chambers of a 
        courtroom or the Bias Incident Group.</p>
