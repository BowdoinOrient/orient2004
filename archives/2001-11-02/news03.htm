      <p>Bowdoin students can celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 18-year-old 
        voting age by heading down Federal Street on Tuesday, November 6 to cast 
        their ballots in the state referendum and municipal elections. The polls 
        are open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.<br>

      <p>Tuesday's election features a proposed change in Brunswick coastal zoning, 
        six state bond levy questions totaling nearly $150-million, and several 
        town officer contests.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If Brunswick voters affirm municipal Question 1-the Coastal Protection 
        Zone amendments passed by the town council last spring-they will bring 
        a complicated series of changes to Brunswick's zoning density code. Supporters 
        argue the revisions will help prevent dangerous lawn and septic system 
        runoff from killing shellfish in Maquoit and Middle Bay, while opponents 
        are concerned that the measure would infringe on private property rights. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Voters will also decide if the state should be allowed to borrow money 
        by issuing bonds to pay for a variety of projects, from affordable housing, 
        transportation, and education to environmental protection and potato marketing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Terms for town and School Board offices are two years. All offices are 
        nonpartisan. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The six bond questions would allow the state to borrow money for a broad 
        range of issues. Question 1 allows bond money for affordable housing and 
        housing for domestic violence victims; Questions 2 covers biomedical and 
        marine research; Question 3 appropriates transportation funding, while 
        Question 4 provides for improvements in educational facilities; Question 
        5 links nine environmental regulation and pollution control provisions 
        with a potato marketing campaign, and Question 6 lets the state borrow 
        money to &quot;make improvements&quot; to state sponsored universities 
        and the Maine Maritime Academy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If all six bonds are approved, the total interest and principal paid 
        will run to approximately $186,437,363, State Treasurer Dale McCormick 
        said in his ballot statement.<br>
      </p>
      <p>All Brunswick voters have a choice between three candidates for the Town 
        Council Representative At-Large. Voters who live in districts One, Three 
        and Four will have a choice of candidates to represent their council districts. 
        <br>
        The incumbents in the other four districts are getting a free ride to 
        re-election-no one has filed against them. All of the School Board officers, 
        including At-Large Officer and Bowdoin Government Professor Allen Springer, 
        are running for re-election unopposed. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Brillant said the town is not predicting a specific turnout for the election. 
        There are 13,934 registered voters in Brunswick, she said, and &quot;Many 
        Bowdoin students are registered in town.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Brunswick citizens may register to receive absentee ballots by declaring 
        their legal residence to be the state of Maine. Any voter may request 
        temporary or permanent absentee status for future elections. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin students may register to vote in the election if they are declared 
        residents of the Town of Brunswick and the State of Maine. Registration 
        is conducted at the Town Clerk's Office at 28 Federal Street. On Election 
        Day, citizens may register at the Recreation Center at 30 Federal Street 
        and only those registering on Election Day may vote at the Center.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Voters in District 7 (encompassing most of the Bowdoin campus proper) 
        who do not register on Election Day must cast their ballots at the Coffin 
        School on Barrows Drive, off of Columbia Avenue. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Registrar of Voters Pauline Brillant said, &quot;Bowdoin students live 
        in every district in Brunswick,&quot; adding that even Brunswick Apartments 
        is in a separate district (District 5) from the majority of the campus. 
        Students are advised to contact the Town Clerk's office to confirm their 
        district and voting location. <br>
        Students who do not want to declare their legal residency here can vote 
        in their home states or cities. Students may register to vote absentee 
        in their home states or cities by logging on to the National Voting Information 
        page of the National Association of Secretaries of State's at <a href="http://www.nass.org/electioninfo/statelinks.html">www.nass.org/electioninfo/statelinks.html</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Voting and absentee registration is managed by the Town Clerk's Office. 
        The office, located at 28 Federal Street in Brunswick, is located directly 
        above the Police Department and is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday 
        through Friday. The town is directing all elections questions to the Clerk's 
        Office at (207) 725-6658.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This year marks the 30th anniversary of Maine's ratification of the 26th 
        Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted 18-20 year-olds the 
        right to vote. According to studies by the non-profit Close Up Foundation, 
        a promoter of the youth vote, only 35 percent of 18-24 year-olds voted 
        in the 2000 presidential election, down from a high of 50 percent in 1972, 
        the first presidential election year after the amendment was ratified.<br>
