        For a man who is perhaps best known for biting the head off a live bat 
        on stage, Ozzy Osbourne has had quite a successful career. In addition 
        to being the front man for Black Sabbath, one of the most influential 
        heavy metal and rock bands in history, he has had a long and fruitful 
        solo career. Down to Earth is the Prince of Darkness's 13th solo album, 
        and many of the tracks are reminiscent of Sabbath's masterpieces of the 
        1970s.<br>
      </p>

      </table>
      <p align="left">The album contains 11 tracks of pure rock adrenaline. Ozzy's 
        powerful and eerily dark voice is complemented by one of the most talented 
        group of musicians he has ever had behind him on a solo record. Mike Bordin, 
        the talented former member of the groundbreaking band Faith No More, sets 
        the pace on drums. Guitar player Zakk Wylde, Ozzy's most legendary axe 
        man since the virtuoso Randy Rhoads, belts out powerful solos that remind 
        one of Tony Iommi, Sabbath's famous guitarist. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The current album, his first solo effort in six years, is 
        surprisingly accessible. While it is still a hard-rock album, the production 
        is remarkably clean. The riffs are nowhere near as sludgy as those of 
        old-school Sabbath, and many of the tracks deal with surprisingly upbeat 
        themes for a man often associated with the Devil. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Indeed, on the brilliant single &quot;Gets Me Through,&quot; 
        Ozzy makes a clear effort to distance himself from Satan. He also throws 
        in a reference to one of Sabbath's hits: &quot;I'm not the kind of person 
        you think I am/ I'm not the Antichrist or the Iron Man.&quot; Furthermore, 
        the album has several slow ballads, such as the standout track &quot;Dreamer,&quot; 
        which seem remarkably upbeat. &quot;Running Out Of Time&quot; is also 
        an excellent slow song. Those who are not familiar with Ozzy will be pleasantly 
        surprised by these tracks.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But the beauty of this record is that it will both satisfy 
        the die-hards and attract new fans. Old-school fans will not be disappointed 
        by more traditional fare such as &quot;That I Never Had,&quot; &quot;Junkie,&quot; 
        and &quot;Black Illusion.&quot; The rough edge and heavy riffs of these 
        songs will surely delight the hardcore fans.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In support of his new album, Ozzy will launch a nationwide 
        arena tour beginning on Halloween. Fellow metal icon Rob Zombie will co-headline 
        the solo tour, his first in seven years. Called &quot;The Merry Mayhem 
        Tour,&quot; proceeds from apparel sales will go to the victims of the 
        September 11th tragedy. In addition, all revenue from ticket sales and 
        merchandise at the New York show will go to the families of the relief 
        workers who died in New York. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In a world dominated by dry, formulaic pop played by artists 
        such as Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys, hard rock albums like 
        this are a breath of fresh air. The recent revitalization of metal by 
        such bands as Tool and System of a Down has put Ozzy even more squarely 
        in the spotlight. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The new metal movement would never have occurred if the 
        godfather of metal had not joined a blues-influenced band known today 
        simply as Sabbath. Fans of rock everywhere would do themselves a favor 
        by picking up this record and paying homage to one of rock's true greats.
