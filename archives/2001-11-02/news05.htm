        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>Near the end of his inaugural speech last Saturday morning, President 
        Barry Mills quoted a teacher in Robert Coles' book, Lives of Moral Leadership, 
        describing a leader as &quot;someone who knows how to persuade others 
        to keep others company, to stand for what she believes in, the good, the 
        one hundred percent right thing to do.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>When speaking with President Mills, it quickly becomes clear that he 
        exemplifies this definition. He is passionate, yet pragmatic about his 
        vision for Bowdoin and reflects this in his conversation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This was particularly evident during an October 30 interview when Mills 
        explained: &quot;I think it is very important for Bowdoin to be a place 
        where one can get a sense of, where we can be a community that represents 
        the world, both nationally and internationally.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He made it clear that his view of Bowdoin's future included increased 
        diversity on campus, not only racially, but also geographically, religiously, 
        socioeconomically, and otherwise. Furthermore, Mills highlighted the need 
        for diversity of intellectual thought, which he called &quot;an exchange 
        of ideas going all ways that makes the place alive.&quot; This is a common 
        theme for the President; he has mentioned the uniqueness of the &quot;Bowdoin 
        Experience&quot; several times since his appointment. In both his inaugural 
        address and initial speech to the first-year students during Orientation, 
        President Mills explored the benefits of the communal aspect of a residential 
        liberal arts education. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With such faith in the purpose of Bowdoin's community, it is to be expected 
        that Mills has expectations for its future evidenced by the three &quot;guideposts&quot; 
        of his inaugural speech: size, collaboration, and access.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;In order to think about growing the college,&quot; said Mills, 
        &quot;we as a community need to understand all of the implications, all 
        that it will allow us to do academically&#133;What does that mean for 
        housing, for lab space, and faculty-wise, facilities-wise, and student 
        service-wise?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Such an increase will help the school &quot;deepen the academic program&quot; 
        and cultivate &quot;intellectual vibrancy on campus,&quot; he explained. 
        Maintaining that any increase in the size of the Bowdoin community would 
        need to be incremental, Mills reiterated the need for progress and change 
        on campus tempered with caution. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I think that we are facing some harder economic times, largely 
        as a result of an endowment which is smaller than we had expected it to 
        be at this time,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, he maintains an infectious positive outlook for Bowdoin's 
        future, asserting that a major capital fund drive will be needed &quot;in 
        the next three or four years,&quot; particularly to help cover the rapidly 
        rising costs of medical insurance. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We're a very healthy college, and together we're going to be able 
        to get through this as a community,&quot; he explained. <br>
      </p>
      <p>As he outlined in his inaugural address, Mills hopes to further develop 
        the Bowdoin community through collaboration (the second &quot;guidepost&quot;) 
        with other schools and facilities across the nation and world. This includes 
        sharing physical space and material resources as well as intellect, programs, 
        and diversity. However, he also maintains that this effort should not 
        change the Bowdoin style and quality of education. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The final guidepost that Mills expressed in his inaugural address was 
        to ensure that access to Bowdoin is widespread and open. Here again, the 
        economic situation has become an issue. Bowdoin's need-blind admissions 
        policy is costly, particularly with 40% of all students on financial aid, 
        a proportion that has been growing in past years. Mills, a financial aid 
        recipient himself during his studies at Bowdoin, feels that maintaining 
        such a policy is essential to &quot;ensuring that people who should come 
        to Bowdoin&#133;can come to Bowdoin.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We have a commitment to Maine, we have a commitment to becoming 
        a more diverse place,&quot; he said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This, however, will further necessitate the upcoming capital fund drive 
        previously mentioned. Another recent furor concerning admissions at Bowdoin 
        and other NESCAC schools concerns the treatment of athletes during the 
        application process. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;[The report] raises a number of serious questions that NESCAC and 
        the college have to face up to. We can debate the math and the numbers, 
        but the trends force us to step back and evaluate,&quot; said Mills. <br>
      </p>
      <p>All of these objectives for the school are intended to contribute to 
        Mills' vision of the Bowdoin community under his leadership. He makes 
        it very clear that his primary focus as Bowdoin's President will be to 
        &quot;deepen the academic programs&quot; and &quot;develop intellectual 
        vibrancy on campus.&quot; Also, Mills is seeking to produce an atmosphere 
        that will &quot;&#133;create leaders who have analytical judgment, but 
        also moral leadership&#133;that is, figuring out what's right and acting 
        on it.&quot; To him, this is the principle role of the College.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills cites numerous Bowdoin alumni who are exemplary in this respect, 
        including Geoffrey Canada, Ellen Baxter, and Andy Reicher. For Mills, 
        this is a classic representation of the Common Good, acting upon ethical 
        impulses to give opportunities to those in need. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Inaugural speeches are times for the vision thing,&quot; said Mills. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Clearly, President Barry Mills has a firm vision for Bowdoin's future. 
        With his comprehensive understanding of the needs of the college, particularly 
        in terms of the Common Good, he should provide intuitive, reasonable, 
        and conscientious leadership to guide Bowdoin through a myriad of difficult 
        decisions in the future. <br>
