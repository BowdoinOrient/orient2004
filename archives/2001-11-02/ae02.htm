        <font size="2">JIM FLANAGAN <br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font><br>
        Once again, the Film Society is doing what has become a tradition over 
        the past few semesters--we are proudly presenting a series of films about 
        drugs. Like I say every time we show movies like this, the Film Society 
        does not endorse drug use; we just think it makes for great film subject 
        matter. This weekend, come out to watch movies about people hopelessly 
        addicted to horrible substances, and it will make your complaints about 
        the long lines at Thorne seem trivial. The movies will be shown in Smith 
        Auditorium, Sills Hall. And, unlike the habits they depict, these films 
        are free and available to everyone.<br>

        <i>Traffic</i><br>
        Steven Soderbergh helms this film that follows a number of stories about 
        the American war on drugs. One story features Michael Douglas as the U.S. 
        drug czar who discovers his daughter is addicted to heroin. Benicio Del 
        Toro, who received the best supporting actor Oscar for his performance, 
        plays a Mexican cop working with the U.S. border patrol. Finally, Catherine 
        Zeta-Jones portrays a woman whose husband has, unbeknownst to her, been 
        arrested for leading a large drug ring. <i>Traffic</i> also won Oscars 
        for best editing, screenplay and direction. It features a terrific ensemble 
        cast and is truly a great film.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Friday at 9:30 p.m.<br>
        <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i><br>
        This is Otto Preminger's 1955 classic, starring Frank Sinatra and Kim 
        Novak. &quot;Ol' Blue Eyes&quot; plays a card shark and former heroin 
        addict who has been released from prison and is fighting his old drug 
        habit. This film was not initially approved by the MPAA because it dealt 
        so frankly with a serious drug addiction, and was instrumental in changing 
        the movie production code.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Saturday at 7 p.m.<br>
        <i>Trainspotting</i><br>
        This is a great U.K. film about four Scottish heroin addicts and the crazy 
        lives they lead. I couldn't help but think of this film when I first saw 
        <i>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i>. Both have that &quot;wild 
        ride&quot; feel to them, and feature a bunch of British guys (ok, they're 
        Scottish in this film, but you know what I mean) pulling off amazing crimes. 
        If you haven't seen this movie before, you should really check it out.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Saturday at 9 p.m.<br>
        <i>Wonder Boys</i><br>
        Curtis Hanson, who previously made such gritty films as <i>The Hand that 
        Rocks the Cradle</i> and <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, presents a different 
        kind of movie this time. Michael Douglas plays Grady Tripp, a Carnegie-Mellon 
        Professor who has some problems. He used to a great author, but now he 
        is in year seven of completing his current book. His agent is pressuring 
        him to finish, his wife has left him, and his mistress reveals she's pregnant 
        (her husband is the chair of Tripp's department, by the way.) In addition, 
        he has to deal with wild students who hit on his agent and who are search 
        for a coat once owned by Marilyn Monroe. The only way Tripp can cope with 
        this crazy weekend is to spend it in a marijuana-induced haze.</p>
