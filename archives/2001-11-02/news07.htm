      <p>Since stress abounds on the Bowdoin campus during midterms, it's little 
        wonder that someone might need a stress ball. However, a device geared 
        for such tension-relieving purposes was the cause of a major drama last 
        weekend, for reasons completely unrelated to its nature. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Around 11:00 p.m. last Saturday, College Security was alerted to the 
        presence of &quot;a suspicious powder found in the Tower,&quot; said Michael 
        Brown, Assistant Director of Security. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;A dispatcher was calling a student about a separate matter, and 
        it happened to be mentioned,&quot; he said. According to sources, someone 
        had been in a Tower bedroom without the owner's knowledge.<br>
      </p>
      <p>At first, no one knew what the substance was, or where it had come from. 
        &quot;Initially, they were unable to identify the substance,&quot; said 
        Brunswick Fire Department Deputy Chief Michael Robitaille. &quot;We were 
        called to the scene around 11:20 p.m.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;They responded and took a look,&quot; Brown said. &quot;No one 
        could determine [the powder's] origin, and at that point, it was labeled 
        as questionable.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The suspicious powder was later determined to be the contents of a stress 
        ball, and harmless. <br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="left">

          <td><img src="images/news08_coles.jpg" width="150" height="222"></td>

      <p>&quot;The [responsible] student came forward, everyone laughed about 
        it, and went home,&quot; Brown said. &quot;It ended up working out exactly 
        as we had trained and planned for.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He also indicated that the security team is going to make use of the 
        situation. &quot;We're going to use it as a training exercise,&quot; he 
        said. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Had the situation been serious, it appears that Security would have been 
        ready for a more dangerous task. &quot;We're lucky that we're all up to 
        snuff with our knowledge of biochemical threats,&quot; Brown said. &quot;It 
        worked out just the way it should have.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Brunswick Fire Department's newly developed threat assessment team, 
        which covers the entire Midcoast region, is a resource that Brown said 
        was important to have nearby in America's current state of uncertainty. 
        &quot;If there is a suspicious letter, [etc.]...it's a nice resource to 
        have right here in the area; they can be on campus in two minutes.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We are responding to calls from all over, because we're essentially 
        the leaders in the area,&quot; Robitaille said. &quot;We've done about 
        95 calls, but I don't believe that any of them have amounted to anything 
        serious.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another situation, one potentially more serious than the anthrax &quot;scare,&quot; 
        according to Robitaille, occurred almost two weeks ago. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;On [October] 22nd at 5:45 a.m., we responded to a reported gas 
        leak in the Moulton Union,&quot; he said. &quot;Upon arrival, we found 
        that the underground propane tank was leaking.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>The fire department quickly cleared the area around Moulton, evacuating 
        Moore Hall and blocking off College Street. &quot;We checked with the 
        proctors and got everyone out,&quot; said Louann Dustin-Hunter, Assistant 
        Director of Security.<br>
      </p>
      <p>After investigating the scene, the fire department determined that the 
        relief valve under the building was open. &quot;We don't know how it got 
        open, but it was fully open, and its not supposed to be,&quot; Robitaille 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We dispersed the propane fumes with a couple of our hose lines 
        and went in and secured the leak,&quot; he continued. &quot;We tested 
        the area with gas meters and they had negative readings, so we cleared 
        the scene.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to the deputy chief, it appears that the leak didn't occur 
        by itself. &quot;We think that somebody tampered with it; I'm not a hundred 
        percent sure, as it's left undetermined in the report,&quot; Robitaille 
        said. &quot;A human element appears to have played a role in it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;It's possible that it was vandalism, but they haven't had any leads 
        as to who might have done it,&quot; Dustin-Hunter said. &quot;At this 
        point, we don't know who it was. It's still an open investigation.&quot;</p>
