      <p>Barry Mills '72 was inaugurated as the 14th president of Bowdoin College 
        in a ceremony held in Morrell Gym on October 27. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Over 1,000 students, faculty, and alumni gathered for what fellow speaker 
        and Maine Department of Education Commissioner J. Duke Albanese '71 called 
        &quot;a day that bodes well both for Bowdoin and for Maine.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>In his inauguration speech, President Mills stressed three important 
        future goals for the college: an increase in size, greater collaboration 
        with other colleges, and greater opportunities for access into Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;I believe deeply in the model of education practiced and refined 
        at Bowdoin during the past two centuries. I intend, as president of this 
        College, to do all that I can to support and advance that model,&quot; 
        said Mills.<br>

      <p>Mills underscored the importance of expanding the size of the college. 
        He stated, &quot;While we must work diligently to reserve our character, 
        I believe we should consider over the next few years whether the breadth 
        of experience here academically and intellectually could be widened if 
        we were a somewhat larger, but still small, community.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>He enunciated the possibility of expanding the student body to 1800 students 
        within the next five years, while both keeping the student-faculty ratio 
        at 10:1 and expanding student services to accommodate the increase.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills also spoke about the need for greater collaboration with other 
        colleges, both around the nation and around the world. &quot;We are a 
        small college with limited resources,&quot; he stated. &quot;We have both 
        geographic benefits and burdens. There is no doubt in my mind that the 
        academic experience provided on this campus could be enhanced significantly 
        through thoughtful collaboration with other colleges, universities, and 
        research centers.&quot;<br>

      <p>Mills also addressed the issue of keeping access to Bowdoin open for 
        students. Although he acknowledged the rising costs of admissions, he 
        emphasized the importance of keeping Bowdoin a need-blind college, admitting 
        students on their merits and academic achievements rather than on their 
        ability to afford education. &quot;Changing our policies to admit students 
        on the basis of the ability to pay, or use scarce financial aid resources 
        in a bidding war for superior students, from my point of view, is not 
        correct, and, I believe, would destine us to mediocrity,&quot; he said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mills identified that one of the most important issues facing the college 
        today is the need to create avenues for technical and scientific dialogue 
        while also preserving a liberal arts tradition. According to him, Bowdoin 
        should &quot;promote an environment and curriculum that makes the complexity 
        of the sciences and our technical world available and accessible to those 
        who may decide to concentrate in other areas, but who are sufficiently 
        wise to appreciate the need for basic literacy and who want to understand 
        the methods of inquiry of the sciences and technology.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Moral leadership, said Mills, is another important responsibility of 
        the college. The College should not only stay strong to the ideal of the 
        Common Good, but also to help cultivate a strong sense of morality and 
        social responsibility among its students.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Our job is to provide students with the intellectual grounding 
        to make what they consider to be the correct decisions for themselves, 
        their families and their communities. But,&quot; he stated, &quot;to this 
        burden I would add the responsibility of preparing students to lead a 
        life of moral leadership best exemplified by graduates like George Mitchell, 
        Geoffrey Canada, and Ellen Baxter.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Speeches were also given by Chair of the Board of Trustees Donald R. 
        Kurtz '63, Maine Department of Education Commissioner J. Duke Albanese 
        '71, Brunswick Town Council Chair Steven H. McCausland, Student Government 
        Executive Board Chair Meghan E. MacNeil '03, and A. LeRoy Greason Professor 
        of Music Mary K. Hunter. The inauguration was opened and closed by Marshal 
        William E. Chapman II '63.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In his speech to President Mills, Former Dean of the Faculty of Arts 
        and Sciences and Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor Emeritus 
        of Harvard University Henry Rosovsky spoke about the need for a liberal 
        arts education in today's society. &quot;The desire for a liberal arts 
        education has never been greater,&quot; he said. &quot;All over the world, 
        people are desiring a liberal arts education.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He also reminded President Mills and the audience of the four essential 
        freedoms of a university delineated by former United States Supreme Court 
        Justice Felix Frankfurter: &quot;to determine for itself on academic grounds 
        who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall be taught, and who should 
        be admitted as students.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>During the event, &quot;Celebration,&quot; a piece by Robert K. Beckwith 
        Professor of Music Elliott S. Schartz, was premiered. The piece, written 
        especially for this occasion, used the letters in Mills' name, as well 
        as the date of the founding of Bowdoin (1-7-9-4) and the date of Mills' 
        inauguration (10-27-01) as the sources of notes and rhythms for his composition.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The inauguration was a culmination of a weekend-long series of events 
        that also included lectures by composer-historian Bernice Johnson Reagon 
        and Nobel-Prize-winning scientist Torsten Wiesel. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At the end of his speech, Mills stated, &quot;I commit to you that I 
        will endeavor to lead this great college with this notion of moral leadership 
        as one guidepost, and with a firm commitment to academic excellence as 
        a second guidepost while striving constantly to determine with all my 
        powers of analysis what is right and just, and then acting on those beliefs 
        with conviction and courage both for the greater good and for the good 
        of our beloved Bowdoin College&quot;<br>
