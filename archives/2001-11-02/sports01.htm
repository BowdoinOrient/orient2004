      <p>With the World Series, regular season football, and the return of the 
        Jordan, there are simply too many sports stories to cover. In other words, 
        I have too many opinions and sports angles to chose solely one. The result? 
        &quot;Thinking outside the Box: The Week in Sports.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Unsportsmanlike Conduct: The recipient of this penalty is New England's 
        Brian Cox who was injured last week in a game against the Denver Broncos. 
        According to Cox, Broncos' offensive lineman Dan Neil intentionally and 
        malignantly chop-blocked him in the third quarter.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In other words, Neil dove into Cox's legs to slow him up. Because of 
        the risk of a knee injury, the league often fines players who partake 
        in this activity. Cox left the game limping back to New England with a 
        broken leg.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Instead of allowing the league to take action against Neil, however, 
        Cox vowed personal revenge: &quot;To be honest, I don't care if it takes 
        the rest of my career. If I ever play football again and play against 
        the guy, he's going to have a blown-out knee. He had the audacity to ask 
        me if I was OK. No, I was not OK.&quot;<br>
        Standing up for yourself is one thing, but promising to end another player's 
        career is completely unprofessional and reprehensible. Hence the unsportsmanlike 
        conduct.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Surprise of the Week: The Arizona Diamond Backs are actually making a 
        series out of the World Series. With each team winning both home games, 
        the series is knotted at two games a piece. What's going on here? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Although it is not highly publicized, the Yankees made a deal with FOX 
        and promised not to sweep the D-Backs. In return, the Yanks get a hefty 
        pay-off.<br>
        Either that, or the D-Backs are actually a bonafide contender.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Redemption of the Week: Doug Flutie led the San Diego Chargers past his 
        former team, the Buffalo Bills, in dramatic fashion in a 27-24 victory. 
        With 1:10 remaining, the 39-year-old Flutie scrambled 13 yards for the 
        game-winning touchdown. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Last February, the Bills cut the diminutive quarterback citing his age 
        and lack of physical talent. Bills owner, Ralph Wilson decided that Rob 
        Johnson was the man to lead his franchise. <br>
      </p>
      <p>At 6'3&quot; and 215 pounds, Johnson has a rocket arm and can actually 
        see over linemen-traits that Flutie lacks. However, Wilson forgot that 
        Flutie is a natural leader and a born winner-traits that Johnson lacks.<br>
        Putting his trust in Johnson, the Bills have sputtered to a 1-5 record 
        while the Chargers are 5-2.<br>
      </p>
      <p>During the off-season, Wilson declared that a victory against the Flutie-led 
        Chargers was more important to him than a Super Bowl victory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately for the Bills, Johnson and Wilson won't get either. Coal 
        all around this Christmas in Buffalo, but &quot;Flutie Flakes&quot; are 
        abundant in San Diego.<br>
        Comeback of the Week: Michael Jordan played his first regular season basketball 
        in three years on October 30. &quot;Michael and the Jordanaires&quot; 
        (as TBS termed the Wizards) took on the New York Knicks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Jordan finished the game with 19 points on 7-21 shooting. He also had 
        five rebounds, six assists, and four steals. Starting at point guard but 
        playing shooting guard and small forward as well, Jordan proved to be 
        one of the best players in the NBA-over 35 years of age at least.<br>
      </p>
      <p>His jump shots were flat for much of the night and his driving skills 
        nonexistent. In fairness to his Airness, he faced double teams throughout 
        as the Knicks forced the Jordanaires to make the big plays.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, late in the fourth quarter, Jordan found himself open on the 
        perimeter with his Wizards down by three points. He heaved up a three-ball 
        hoping to push the game into overtime. The mythical, magical Michael drilled 
        the trey and reasserted himself as the greatest clutch player in the NBA. 
        Right?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Actually, Jordan's three-pointer clanked off the side of the rim, and 
        the Wizards eventually fell to the Knicks 93-91. Not a bad first showing 
        for the Wizards or Michael, but one thing is obvious.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Jordanaires are as far away from an NBA title as Michael is from 
        his former self. Paradoxically, the young Wizards need to get older, and 
        the old Michael needs to get younger.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Outrage of the Week: The World Boxing Council (WBC) stripped Australian 
        middleweight boxer Anthony Mundine of his number 26 ranking and indefinitely 
        expelled him the the WBC because of his reaction to the September 11 terrorist 
        attacks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mundine, who is a Muslim, said &quot;I really feel that it's not our 
        problem. They call it an act of terrorism but if you can understand religion 
        and our way of life, it's not about terrorism.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>He continued, &quot;It's about fighting for God's laws, and America's 
        brought it upon themselves (for) what they've done in the history of time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Pretty outrageous, huh? <br>
      </p>
      <p>The truly outrageous part of this story is the WBC's reaction to his 
        comments. Banning him from boxing in WBC events contradicts what the United 
        States is hoping to accomplish in the war against terrorism.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The WBC said that Mundine's remarks &quot;are unbelievable and intolerable, 
        and seriously hurt world society and boxing.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>If the September 11 attacks were truly against American democracy and 
        freedom, as President George Bush asserts, then protecting our values 
        and ideals is paramount to the success of a rebuilt nation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Denying freedom of speech and coercing people into patriotism is not 
        the solution. Diverging opinions and substantially different viewpoints 
        are actually necessary for a world-wide understand of what happened on 
        September 11. <br>
        Mundine, who is still a member of the International Boxing Federation, 
        said that his comments &quot;have been taken out of context by the Australian 
        media&quot; and that he does not support terrorism in any form.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What message does the WBC's actions send to other athletes throughout 
        the the United States and the world? Support the United States' actions 
        or your professional career may be in doubt.</p>
