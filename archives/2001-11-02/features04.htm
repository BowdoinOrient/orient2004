      <p>&quot;Franklin Pierce was no genius,&quot; wrote historian Larry Gara. 
        &quot;Indeed,&quot; the biographer of Pierce's presidency continued, &quot;the 
        ordinary demands of the office were often beyond his ability. He was a 
        politician of limited ability, and instead of growing in his job, he was 
        overwhelmed by it.&quot; This was indeed harsh criticism of the fourteenth 
        president of the United States and a Bowdoin graduate (class of 1824). 
        But it was all true. Franklin Pierce was not a good president, and his 
        administration was probably responsible for bringing the nation closer 
        to civil war. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Elected as a Democrat who supported the extension of slavery in 1852, 
        Pierce tried to distract the nation from its internal problems by dreaming 
        of expansion into Cuba, Canada, Nicaragua, and even Formosa (currently 
        known as Taiwan). Internally the nation was a mess. New lands that had 
        been acquired from the Mexican War were in need of organization, and the 
        Fugitive Slave Law had been strengthened by the Compromise of 1850 and 
        led to the growth of the abolition movement in the North. There were also 
        problems with the British both in Canada and in Central America.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="right">

      <p>Few of these problems would be solved by the Pierce administration. How 
        could Pierce himself hope to accomplish anything when his personal life 
        was in ruins? His wife was going slowly insane because of the death of 
        their third and final son had driven her over the edge. The White House 
        was a cold and dreary home. Perhaps, the President himself knew that it 
        was not his place and that the responsibilities of the Office were far 
        beyond his little hands. He would walk around Washington DC alone to think 
        and ponder. One time he told visitors to the White House, &quot;You need 
        no introduction to this house, it is your house, and I am but the tenant 
        for a time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, Franklin Pierce's life at its pinnacle was a tragedy. If not because 
        he was a weak man, but because he was severely out of date. The time of 
        slavery and states rights was slowly passing, but Mr. Pierce would never 
        understand that. He would uphold his party's beliefs till the end of his 
        days. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The major event of the time was the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Spearheaded 
        by Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the bill proclaimed that both 
        the Kansas and Nebraska territories could organize as either slave or 
        free states utilizing the concept of popular sovereignty. The adoption 
        of this bill would nullify the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and thus open 
        up the entire western United States as new ground for slavery to expand.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In February of 1854, at the height of the Kansas-Nebraska debate in the 
        Senate, a Bowdoin graduate and former Congressman returned to Washington. 
        He was by this time forty-seven years old but as bold and as unwavering 
        as ever. The newly elected Senator from Maine, William Pitt Fessenden 
        joined the minority of his senatorial colleagues who opposed the Douglas 
        Bill.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In his speech against the bill, the night before it passed in the Senate, 
        the supporters of the bill were too many for even the dedicated Free-Soilers 
        and Whigs to fight off, Fessenden spoke of slavery as a handicap that 
        was holding back the growth of the nation. He reminded his fellow senators 
        that &quot;if an institution injuriously affects the prosperity of a part, 
        its evils are felt through the whole system.&quot; But here was the difference 
        in how the two halves, that would within a decade wage war on each other, 
        saw the nation. <br>
      </p>
      <p>On the one hand, there were those who saw slavery as a cancer that was 
        spreading across the land, affecting not only the slave states, but also 
        the free ones as well. And then there were those who believed that human 
        bondage was something that was none of anyone else's business, that a 
        state had the right to do whatever it wanted with the people it deemed 
        lesser than others. <br>
        Fessenden hammered away at his colleagues saying that to yield on this 
        bill would be in a sense appeasement. It was soothing a bully so that 
        he could take more and more from you as time went on. Frankly, Fessenden 
        declared, he was sick and tired of it. To those who threatened secession, 
        Fessenden declared:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Do not delay it on account of anybody at the North&#133;We love the Union 
        as well as you do, and you love it as much as we do; I am willing to allow 
        that. But sir, if it has come to this, that whenever a question comes 
        up between the free States and the slave States of this Union, we are 
        to be threatened with disunion unless we yield, if that is the only alternative 
        to be considered, it ceases to be a very grave question for honorable 
        men and free men to decide&#133; we are ready to meet every question on 
        this floor fairly and honestly; we are willing to be bound by the decision 
        of the majority, as law. If it operates hardly upon us, we will bear it. 
        If it is unconstitutional, we must go to the proper tribunal for a decision, 
        and not threaten each other with what no one of us desires to execute.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It has a grand spectacle of a man rising to fight against what he believed 
        to be an injustice. It would not be the last time in his life that William 
        Pitt Fessenden spoke his mind for he was a man of rigid ideals and unshakable 
        determination. But all of it was, in this case, for nothing. The next 
        day, March 4 1854 the Kansas-Nebraska Act passed in the Senate. When the 
        bill passed the House of Representatives in May of that same year it seemed 
        as if everything had been lost. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Referring to the failure of the Whig Party in the recent presidential 
        election and its already divided members, Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, 
        himself a Free-Soiler and perhaps best know for being caned in the Senate 
        to the brink of death, remarked, &quot;out of this chaos the party of 
        freedom must arise.&quot; And so it was that the Republican Party was 
        born.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That same year, to heighten the tension that was already rising near 
        the boiling point of civil war, Franklin Pierce would mishandle the trail 
        of a runaway slave by the name of Anthony Burns and set off riots in the 
        streets of the abolitionist stronghold, Boston.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In Kansas people from all over the nation, of all beliefs and political 
        ideologies converged to form two governments and to battle it out for 
        the fate of the territory. In Maine a fifteen year old Sam Fessenden, 
        son to the senator in Washington and later in his life to be a part of 
        the Bowdoin class of 1861, looked on with eager anticipation of what was 
        to come.<br>
