        <font size="2">JAIMYE BARTAK <br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p>On the evening of October 24th, a small crowd gathered in Searles to 
        hear author and poet Jane Brox read selections from her latest book <i>Five 
        Thousand Days Like This One: An American Family History</i>. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In an introduction, Professor Franklin Burroughs commented that while 
        there are many personal and natural histories of New England, Brox's &quot;effortlessly 
        remarkable&quot; language delivered stories with &quot;precision, modesty, 
        and accuracy&quot;, setting it apart from the many others that he has 
        read.<br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Five Thousand Days Like This One</i> is a collection of essays focusing 
        on Brox's family farm and the local history of the Merrimac Valley in 
        Massachusetts. &quot;Influenza, 1918&quot;, the first selection that Brox 
        delivered, recalled the oft-forgotten 1918 flu epidemic that ravaged the 
        world near the conclusion of World War I: &quot;It had started as a seemingly 
        common thing&quot;, she read, &quot;&#133;something that would run its 
        course in the comfort of camphor and bed rest.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The story then contrasted the quiet routine of countryside life with 
        the swift and decisive manner that the influenza epidemic invaded. Brox's 
        farmhouse was a fortunate oasis of wary health amid a &quot;city&quot; 
        of quarantines and sickness, and her father was compelled to assume the 
        chores of his ill aunts, uncles, and cousins. Though the epidemic began 
        at the end of summer, Brox's words and steadily consistent voice illustrated 
        a town so paralyzed and frozen with fear that all details seemed to have 
        occurred amidst two feet of snow. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The epidemic finally subsided by the end of October, however, and the 
        &quot;predictable quiet&quot; of the countryside returned. The ending 
        of the story mentioned that the ensuing winter was so cold that the dam 
        in Lawrence iced over and &quot;had to be dynamited&quot;. &quot;Influenza 
        1918&quot; concluded with a recollection of father as he gazed out to 
        the overgrown horizon from their farm, and how &quot;once in a while out 
        of nowhere he'd mention the lights of the tent hospital as if he could 
        still see them, strange and clear.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Brox continued on from the ending of &quot;Influenza 1918&quot; with 
        excerpts from &quot;Storm&quot;, a story written shortly after her father's 
        death in 1995. Recounting an early- winter blizzard that shut down the 
        Merrimac Valley one December, it centered on her family's attempt to cope 
        with the recent death of her father and the fate of the family farm. In 
        her father's absence, Brox assumed the role of caretaker, ensuring that 
        a fire stayed warm for her mother and aunt, that the necessary bills were 
        paid, and all medications were administered. But it was this new role 
        that made the death of her father so much more acute, and an instinctual 
        longing for the past and the old established responsibilities of mother 
        and daughter: &quot;Sometimes I wish she wouldn't tolerate my care&quot;, 
        she read, &quot;I wish she could break out of the place death's aftermath 
        has consigned to her.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>The selections Brox chose to read illustrated her family's farm as a 
        sort of fortress surrounded by the various events of time and history. 
        But they also played a part in a larger theme to which she alluded before 
        reading, that of her family's farmhouse as one of the last strongholds 
        against the epidemic of developmental sprawl that has besieged our nation's 
        landscape. Often, she said, she is implored by people in her community 
        to ensure that her family's homestead is preserved against development. 
        Here, she identified a large gulf between the town that looked at her 
        farm as an idyllic landmark of the rural countryside and everything else 
        that went on inside the house, including the decisive realities that her 
        family faced in maintaining it. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Following the reading, questions arose from the audience about Brox's 
        writing methods and sources of information. Brox responded that much of 
        the information collected for &quot;Influenza 1918&quot; was obtained 
        through oral recordings and medical records held by the town of Lawrence, 
        as well as through her father's own memories. It was a task that served 
        as a &quot;constant revelation&quot;, she conceded, as the Great War often 
        eclipsed recollections and records of the influenza epidemic. <br>
      </p>
      <p>This considered, Brox's reconstruction of detail and sensation in her 
        story is quite noteworthy. A question also arose about the future of her 
        family's farm, which is now under the care of an overseer who leases the 
        house and land to grow vegetables. She replied that the answer was still 
        unclear, and while she always hopes the farm will remain productive and 
        within her family, change is inevitable. Brox's stories, while at once 
        preserving a place and a family history in her words, also strongly illustrate 
        this all-too-true fact of life. </p>
