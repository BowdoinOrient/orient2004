      <p>What do you say at the abrupt end of a near-perfect season, at the splitting 
        of a successful team such as the 2001 women's rugby team? <br>

      <p>Nothing. And silence was the reaction of the ruggers as they learned 
        Monday that they had missed the New England playoffs to Tufts by losing 
        just one game, and that they had also missed the wild-card spot to Springfield 
        by a scoring technicality. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Players were particularly disappointed because Springfield won the wild-card 
        spot by point differential. While Bowdoin had scored more total points 
        throughout the season, Springfield's squad had fewer points scored against 
        it.<br>
        However, the Bear ruggers ended their season with style, grace, and passion. 
        In a quick and glorious game last Saturday afternoon, the A-side women 
        defeated archrival Wellesley by a score of 49-20. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Bowdoin scored almost immediately, setting the quick and Bear-dominated 
        pace of the game. Having prepared mentally and physically all week for 
        the match, keeping the memory of last year's loss at Wellesley in mind, 
        and knowing that the game would be the last for many players, the team 
        performed with an intensity clear to any spectator. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Lindsay Pettingill and junior Ellie Doig both scored twice in 
        Saturday's game. Other scorers included senior Jess Bergen, sophomores 
        Lynnette Batt and Courtney Reilly, and senior Julie Thompson with conversion 
        kicks. <br>
        Players left the pitch feeling satisfied with a well-played final match 
        against Wellesley. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Even more impressive, one might argue, was the incredible talent and 
        promise the Bowdoin B-side team has shown all year and in the Wellesley 
        game as well. Finishing the season undefeated, the B-squad defeated Wellesley 
        17-10. The team played with a cohesion unexpected by a group so diverse 
        in experience.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Senior Lauren Rodriquez and juniors Andrea Weeks and Jess Morin scored 
        for the Bears. In addition, new kicking sensation Dawn Rackliffe made 
        her debut with a two-point conversion kick.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Thus, at Monday's final meeting of the year, the team displayed a mix 
        of emotions: pride in the season's successes, disappointment in missing 
        the playoffs, and hope for the spring's short season and the following 
        next year. Seniors and first years alike spoke on the meaning of the team 
        for themselves and described a collectively-felt love for the sport and 
        their teammates. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Coaches MaryBeth and Bob Matthews praised the ruggers for their efforts 
        and urged them to let go of their disappointment at missing the playoffs. 
        The coaches also reminded the ruggers that many Bowdoin rugby alums have 
        gone on to join club side and national rugby teams across the country. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Putting the team's inner workings into words is difficult. As a player 
        myself, I have never known a group to be more open, accepting, exciting, 
        and inspiring as my fellow teammates have proved to be this year. The 
        smiles and jokes, stretching and preparing, analysis and constructive 
        criticism, hugs and support, cheers and excitement, and even tears and 
        disappointment that we shared have created a bond between friends I'd 
        never shared before.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While I assume that such unity exists on other teams, the experience 
        of playing a sport as physically demanding as rugby and developing such 
        strong relationships with teammates is a combination I've never felt in 
        the past nor on other athletic teams. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The caring attitude and mutual respect fundamental to the team is a direct 
        function of coaches MaryBeth and Bob Matthews, who create a truly familial 
        atmosphere.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Also crucial to the team was experienced leadership from captains Sarah 
        Jenness and Katherine Buckspan. Jenness, with her decision-making in the 
        backline, and Buckspan, with her respected authority among the forwards, 
        encouraged an inclusive yet competitive atmosphere that challenged the 
        entire team.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Junior Karen Finnegan stated what the entire team both knew and felt. 
        &quot;It would not have been the season that it was without the leadership 
        of Buckspan and Jenness, both on and off the pitch,&quot; she said. &quot;Their 
        drive and determination to succeed are an inspiration. It is impossible 
        to give anything less than your best when faced with their dedication. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;The seniors provided the strong foundation that the team needed,&quot; 
        she continued. Throughout the season, their patience at practice and enthusiasm 
        at games have taught new players what it means to be a member of the women's 
        rugby team.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Future plans for the team include a four-day camp this summer and a possible 
        tour in Australia. <br>
