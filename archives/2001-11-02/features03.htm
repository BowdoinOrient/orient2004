        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D. <br>
        STAFF WRITER<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><i>Dear Dr. Jeff: &quot;Like all of us, we're very worried about the 
        threat of anthrax. What is the situation up here Maine? How is the Health 
        Center handling this bioterrorist threat?&quot; -A Concerned Parent</i><br>
      </p>
      <p>Dear Concerned Parent: The threat of anthrax is of course frightening 
        to us all. There are so many unknowns, so many imponderables, and the 
        situation seems to change hourly. <br>
      </p>
      <p>There are also many things we do know and many reasons to feel reassured 
        and protected, particularly here in Maine. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The numbers involved so far are very small. Nationally, there have been 
        about 35 exposures, which have resulted in 16 infections. Ten people have 
        developed inhalation anthrax, and four of those ten have died. Six people 
        have developed the far less dangerous cutaneous disease, and four others 
        are thought to have unconfirmed cutaneous infections.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In Maine, there have been no known exposures to anthrax and no known 
        cases of anthrax infection. To date, about 105 packages have been tested 
        for anthrax by the State lab, and all 105 were negative.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Without meaning to seem insensitive to the plight of any of the unfortunate 
        victims of anthrax poisoning, allow me to point out that we can expect 
        a full 20,000 people to die of the flu this winter. This is expected the 
        timing and nature of the annual flu epidemic fully characterized, risk 
        factors for developing complications of the illness well described, the 
        clinical course of the disease well known, an effective preventive vaccine, 
        diagnostic tests for influenza readily available, and antiviral medication 
        readily available. At issue here is much more our health care and public 
        health systems than extremely limited and unlikely exposures to aerosolized 
        spores.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The microbiology of anthrax was described in depth by Dr. McBride <a href="../2001-10-26/features01.htm">last 
        week</a> in The Orient.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Maine Bureau of Health would like us all to understand four key clinical 
        facts about anthrax. First, anthrax is not contagious. It cannot be spread 
        through personal contact. Second, anthrax infection is treatable, especially 
        if the infection is caught early, or is cutaneous. Third, anthrax spores 
        are very difficult to aerosolize effectively via an envelope or package. 
        And finally, cutaneous anthrax is very difficult to contract through intact 
        skin, especially after hand-washing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Maine has a coordinated system of health, emergency management, and law 
        enforcement agencies, which are monitoring and ready to address any potential 
        threat from biological, chemical or nuclear terrorism. It is important 
        to note that much of this system existed prior to September 11. Antibiotic 
        and vaccine stockpiles, for instance, were created over two years ago 
        as a component of emergency response plans that were elaborated more than 
        three years ago.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We have all heard a lot about what to do and what not to do with suspicious 
        mail and unknown powders. We may also need to understand a little more 
        about nasal swab testing for anthrax. These are not clinical tests that 
        detect incubating anthrax infections. These tests only measure possible 
        exposure, within the previous 24 hours, to anthrax spores. They are epidemiologic 
        tools, often criminal investigative tools, and not diagnostic tools. Federal 
        and State health officials recommend nasal swab testing only for those 
        who may have been exposed to a substance that has been proven to contain 
        anthrax spores. </p>
      <p>So far, thank goodness, no one in Maine has met the criterion for testing.<br>
        A positive nasal swab test would mean a full 60 day course of antibiotics. 
        Fortunately, we now know that exposure to any of the currently isolated 
        anthrax strains can be effectively treated with Doxycycline.<br>
      </p>
      <p>What else can we do, should we do? We should all get flu shots. As our 
        Surgeon General has pointed out, most of us can avoid flu-like symptoms, 
        the kind which might make us worry about early, prodromal anthrax, by 
        simply getting a flu shot and preventing influenza infection. Production 
        of flu vaccine may have gotten off to a late start this year, but there 
        will be more vaccine available by late December than ever before. At the 
        Health Center, we hope to start our flu vaccine clinics towards the end 
        of this month. Flu shots will be available free of charge to students 
        and for $5.00 to faculty, staff and community members.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We should also do our best to stay well informed. There are many web-based 
        sources for up-to-date information about anthrax and bioterrorism. Many 
        of the most helpful Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization 
        websites can be accessed via the Bureau of Health (<a href="http://www.state.me.us/dhs">www.state.me.us/dhs</a> 
        and click on &quot;bioterrorism&quot;) or the University of Albany (<a href="http://www.albany.edu/sph/bt/index.html">www.albany.edu/sph/bt/index.html</a>).<br>
      </p>
      <p>To all of our healths!<br>
      </p>
