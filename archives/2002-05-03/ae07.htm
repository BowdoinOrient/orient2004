      <p> This is the last issue of the Orient for the year, but we wouldn't want 
        you to be uninformed about the new music to be discovered this summer. 
        So here's my guide to the best tunes to be found before September.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">

          <td><font size="2">Punk rock group Weezer is scheduled to release its 
            fourth album, <i>Maladroit</i>, on May 14. (<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com">rollingstone.com</a>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Weezer, possibly the best band in rock, will release their fourth album 
        entitled <i>Maladroit</i> on May 14, almost a year to the day after <i>The 
        Green Album</i>. You all already know &quot;Dope Nose&quot; is a great 
        tune, and those of you who have been following along during the recording 
        process as the band posted demos and live versions on their website know 
        the rest is pretty good too. If you think this was fast, album number 
        five is halfway recorded and hits stores in February. Add this to endless 
        touring, and they're making up pretty well for the lost time after the 
        painful commercial failure of their masterpiece Pinkerton. If their luck 
        holds, they may end up with their first #1 album. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Moby releases 18 on the same day. The little bald dude's sixth album 
        will feature some special guests including Sinead O'Connor and Angie Stone 
        and features the single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Eminem returns after a fairly silent year on June 4 with <i>The Eminem 
        Show</i> and its Moby-dissing single &quot;Without Me.&quot; Eminem produces 
        most of it himself. Unlike the sharing-inclined Weezer, Em is wary of 
        online piracy and guarding the album fiercely, so no one's heard it yet. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>Since record sales are in decline through the start of 2002, the industry 
        is counting on big numbers for <i>The Eminem Show</i> and Korn's <i>Untouchables</i>, 
        due out June 11. On &quot;Here to Stay,&quot; the godfathers of n&uuml;-metal 
        sound sort of scary and not nearly as commercial as on the singles from 
        their last two albums, which might not be the answer to the industry's 
        prayers. But hey, look how well Tool's <i>Lateralus</i> sold. <br>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most anticipated albums of the summer has got to be Dave Matthews 
        Band's <i>Busted Stuff</i>, out July 16. The record is mostly the songs 
        from the infamous Lillywhite sessions for their fourth album, which the 
        band put aside, and then started from scratch to make the polished <i>Everyday</i> 
        with Glen Ballard. A few new tunes are here as well. And the band is jamming 
        again.</p>
      <p>David Bowie and Oasis release <i>Heathen</i> and <i>Heathen Chemistry</i> 
        respectively in June and July, respectively. Bowie's album will feature 
        guests such as Dave Grohl and Moby. Oasis's will be their first to include 
        new guitarist and bassist Gem Archer and Andy Bell. Liam gets to write 
        more songs and Noel gets to sing more songs. Fellow Britpop act Coldplay 
        will release their sophomore album, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i>, 
        this summer.<br>
        Other artists releasing albums this summer include Red Hot Chili Peppers 
        (<i>By the Way</i>), Our Lady Peace (<i>Gravity</i>, June 18), Filter 
        (<i>The Amalgamut</i>, July 23), Wyclef Jean (<i>Masquerade</i>, June 
        18), Flaming Lips (<i>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</i>), and maybe 
        even Counting Crows. The fourth Foo Fighters album, guaranteed by Dave 
        Grohl to rock, has been put on hold until September while he has returned 
        to the drum kit for Queens of the Stone Age (<i>Songs for the Deaf</i>, 
        July) and will be touring with them. <br>
        In case anybody cares (and I certainly hope not many of you do), Papa 
        Roach will release lovehatetragedy on June 18. They say they've given 
        themselves a punk makeover and the singer, formerly known as Coby Dick, 
        has reverted to his birth name, Jacoby Shaddix. <br>
      </p>
      <p>For those sick of the tragedy that is modern rock radio today, be watching 
        for the Vines, a young Australian band in the refreshing, stripped-down 
        rock and roll vein of the Strokes, the White Stripes, and the Hives. The 
        group will release their debut album Highly Evolved on July 16. In the 
        meantime, pick up the Strokes and White Stripes albums if you don't already 
        have them. Viva la revolution!</p>
