      <p> I apologize in advance for my review choice this week. I didn't know 
        what I was getting into. All I had heard about this movie was that it 
        had Angelina Jolie and that her character's life changed due to a startling 
        prophecy that she was going to die. I thought it was a thriller-a suspense 
        drama of sorts. I know, I know; I should've been more careful.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I wasn't tipped off until I walked up to screen four and saw the film's 
        mylar (the strip poster next to the movie times): a big smiling platinum-blond 
        head of Angelina Jolie on one side and a frustrated little Edward Burns 
        leaning on the other side. Classic chick flick poster design-drat. I then 
        briefly considered sneaking over into <i>The Scorpion King</i>, smacked 
        myself for thinking such a horrible thing, and trudged in under the mylar's 
        gaze. I swear Angelina was smirking at me.</p>
      <p>In a state of denial, I looked at the bright side. I reminded myself 
        that this was an Oscar-winning actress. But then I thought about the director, 
        Stephen Herek. Previous works include <i>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</i>. 
        Somehow Oscar-winning actress and a stoned Keanu Reeves didn't really 
        seem to mesh well. No good. <br>
      </p>
      <p><i>Life or Something Like It</i> is the story of Lanie Kerrigan (Angelina 
        Jolie), a local news reporter with a seemingly perfect life that is thrown 
        into question once a homeless prophet tells her that she will die in a 
        week and his other predictions start coming true. Little by little, she 
        begins to see the superficiality in her life and makes accordant changes; 
        namely, of course, she gives up her lifelong broadcasting dreams to continue 
        a relationship with co-worker Pete (Edward Burns).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Women's Studies would have a field day with this one: working woman out 
        on the town about to make it big &quot;realizes&quot; that she has to 
        give it up in order to be happy with her &quot;true love&quot; guy. But 
        hey-that's what chick flicks are supposed to do: provide love-sick women 
        with vicariously-fulfilled romantic fantasies. And why not? <br>
      </p>
      <p>Well, fine, but I never thought Angelina would go for this. She's a rebellious, 
        mentally unstable power-girl in <i>Girl Interrupted</i>, the femme fatale 
        in <i>Original Sin</i>, then she steadily declines to the male spectacle 
        Lara Croft in <i>Tomb Raider</i>, and now she has fallen to the status 
        of female envy magnet. Cute, but disappointing. Not a lot of high-class 
        acting going on. She needs to get back to the good roles.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As for Edward Burns, he was there pretty much to be looked at. The man 
        is sexy as all hell, but can't really act (take the Robert De Niro disaster 
        <i>15 Minutes</i>, for example). I didn't see the chemistry between the 
        two leads much either. As in many chick flicks, their relationship goes 
        from a childish &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; I-hate-you, you-hate-me 
        battle of wits to an all-out romance. This method, though sweet and sometimes 
        effective, is getting old.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, anyway, the directing was very Mighty-Duckish (another of Herek's 
        films), with a general overly-optimistic mood and people randomly breaking 
        out into song-namely a rendition of &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot; 
        sung by random participants in a strike, as though they were in a musical. 
        Oh dear.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The story wasn't all that thought-provoking or intelligent-it was pretty 
        much just a skeleton for the girl-needs-boy plot. The only thing tagging 
        you along is the question of whether or not Lanie's actually gonna die. 
        Not that that's hard to figure out. This isn't <i>Sweet November</i> or 
        <i>City of Angels</i>, it's Bill and Ted. But hey-I don't want to spoil 
        the ending&#133; <br>
      </p>
      <p>But then, of course, a happy ending always makes you feel good, and this 
        is what this movie does and does well. So if you need a vicarious fantasy 
        this weekend, head towards Angelina's neon-yellow hair. She'll do the 
        same old thing, but she won't let you down. As for me, I'm starting the 
        summer season off right with a movie with zero chick flick appeal: Sam 
        Raimi's <i>Spiderman</i> (reader cheers). Yeah that's right. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Enjoy the summer, dear readers, and I'll see you all next year. </p>
