      <p align="left"><font size="5">Focus attention on stereotypes, not racism<br>
        <font size="2">JONA KIM</font><font size="2"><br>
        CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">The discourse among Asian-American college students regarding 
        the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch graphic T-shirts concerns the necessity to 
        distinguish whether the shirts constitute racism. The consensus seems 
        to be that the shirts, with slogans such as, &quot;Wong Brothers Laundry 
        Service: Two Wongs Can Make It White,&quot; next to caricatures of slant-eyed 
        Asians with conical hats, symbolize racism. Activists are demanding that 
        Abercrombie &amp; Fitch make a sincere apology by acknowledging that the 
        shirts are racist, rather than just pulling them from the shelves.</p>
      <p align="left">If the goal of these Asian-American students is to educate, 
        they are expending their energy on action that does little to help Americans 
        understand why the shirts are offensive. The task of utmost importance 
        for Asian-American students is to explain the offensive nature of the 
        stereotypes embodied by the caricatures, rather than claiming their racist 
        nature, which only kindles confusion among all Americans.</p>
      <p align="left">This is my attempt to elucidate the confusion. I propose 
        that we focus our attention on the stereotypes behind the adornments before 
        making vehement charges of racism. An explication of what these stereotypes 
        implicate is a more effective method of generating awareness.</p>
      <p align="left">Abercrombie &amp; Fitch decided to pull the shirts off shelves 
        when an overwhelming number of college students (both Asian Americans 
        as well as non-Asian Americans) expressed indignation. In the aftermath, 
        however, many still wonder why these shirts sparked so much anger. Some 
        even suggest that Asian Americans should lighten up because the stereotypes 
        portrayed by the shirts are an accurate characterization of many Asian 
        Americans and provide a good laugh. </p>
      <p align="left">Thomas D. Lennox, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch's senior manager 
        of investor relations and corporate communications, said, &quot;It's not, 
        and never has been, our intention to offend anyone. These T-shirts were 
        designed with the sole purpose of adding humor and levity to our fashion 
        line.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">The company expected its market to embrace the designs and 
        hoped the release of the new T-shirt line would increase sales to Asian 
        Americans, a group with an estimated purchasing power of over $250 billion. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">But Abercrombie and Fitch overlooked something rather significant: 
        the message sent by the shirts. Quite simply, they mock Asian Americans' 
        physical features and pronunciation of English. Stereotypes like these 
        have been used in the past to underscore Asian Americans' nature as &quot;foreign&quot;; 
        not true members of American society. This perception was what led to 
        the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese Americans during 
        World War II. Slant-eyed caricatures of Laundromat workers speaking broken 
        English shadows an entire group of people and minimizes their individuality 
        and personal identity.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many Asian-American parents are well-educated doctors, lawyers, 
        and engineers. Yet most have overcome significant hardships in the initial 
        stages of their lives as residents of America. Thus, to many Asian Americans, 
        shirts containing &quot;lighthearted&quot; messages that poke fun at the 
        difficult realities of life do not provide any sort of humor. It trivializes 
        their efforts to succeed through avenues of hard work. </p>
      <p align="left">This incident should exasperate all Americans, not just 
        Asian Americans. The T-shirts contribute to the perpetuation of stereotypes 
        that have no place in society. They undermine the contributions Asian 
        Americans have made in the United States, and indirectly preserve the 
        idea that all Asian Americans are slant-eyed foreigners that speak broken 
        English.</p>
      <p align="left">Are these shirts racist? Opinions vary, even within the 
        diverse Asian-American community. However, we can all agree that Abercrombie 
        &amp; Fitch has committed a disservice to Asian Americans by producing 
        shirts that display stereotypes. Stereotypes are dangerous, serving as 
        the root cause of prejudice and leading to racism. Heightened awareness 
        of these stereotypes, and recent activism like the actions of Asian-American 
        students, will, hopefully, help to obviate racism.</p>
