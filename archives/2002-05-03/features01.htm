      <p align="left">1600 people, most between the ages of 18 and 22, pass their 
        days and nights amidst the campus' squat brick buildings, perched atop 
        the highest hill in a classic village in the rural Northeast. Steeples 
        and stone towers remind people in town and on campus who is in charge.<br>
      </p>

      <p align="left">The town seems ambivalent to the campus' presence. &quot;You 
        hardly even notice it,&quot; says one resident. Other residents seem to 
        resent the people at the institution. &quot;They've never been responsible 
        for anything in their lives,&quot; says another. &quot;It's the best college 
        they've ever had.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But what kind of college cuts educational programs at the 
        same time it builds a new barbed wire fence around campus? The kind with 
        such a reputation that it has no problem attracting hundreds of new faces 
        every year. That kind is also known as a prison.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Tracy Huling, the filmmaker and activist who 
        came to Bowdoin Monday to present her documentary &quot;Yes, in my backyard,&quot; 
        rural communities across the Northeast-and throughout the country-are 
        lobbying hard to get prisons built nearby. Like the liberal arts colleges 
        they sometimes mimic, rural prisons often radically change the aggregate 
        population of a town, bringing urbanites and people of color into a largely 
        white, sometimes suspicious community. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Unlike rural colleges, however, the prisons are seeing an 
        exceptional building boom-245 in the last decade alone-and politicians 
        are increasingly using them as an economic development tool to bring back 
        steady jobs to towns that are still suffering the sting of farm consolidation, 
        flight of manufacturing jobs to developing nations and Wal-Mart-style 
        decimation of Main Street.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The film, a 1998 documentary from Galloping Girls Productions, 
        is the first look at why prison construction is booming while violent 
        crime is plunging. Huling contends that the political debate about building 
        new prisons centers around rural economic development &quot;rather than 
        why we needed to lock all these people up.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A former state government lobbyist in Albany, New York, 
        Huling began investigating the literature on emerging rural prison economies 
        in the mid-1990s. &quot;I called up the Department of Justice in Washington,&quot; 
        she says, &quot;and I asked them to send me studies on prisons being used 
        as rural economic development tools. They told me there was nothing-not 
        a single report-and that if I found something, could I please send them 
        a copy!&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The documentary begins in the revitalized shopping district 
        of an upstate New York farm town, where a jolly old man, bearded and wearing 
        a red felt suit, exchanges high fives with local kids who have come to 
        ring in the Christmas shopping season. The idea, in the opening sequence 
        of the film, is that the town, Coxsackie, New York, will be celebrating 
        a brighter Christmas this year, thanks to the expansion of Greene Correctional 
        Facility, up the hill from Main Street.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The documentary examines the reactions of several locals 
        to the two prisons. After hearing from neighbors, wardens and other employees 
        and local politicians, one gets the sense that only the politicians realize 
        the scope of the impact the prisons have on their economy and way of life. 
        Few residents recognize how dependent their way of life is on the draconian 
        drug laws that keep their prisons expanding.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Most everyone in the town-prison employees and other citizens 
        alike-refer to the prisoners in extra-human terms. Their identity is a 
        collective one, broken down to the individual level only to count &quot;beds,&quot; 
        or &quot;population.&quot; Only one resident on the video, a Corrections 
        Officer, characterized the inmates as &quot;pretty much regular guys who 
        just screwed up once or twice.&quot; Most echoed the thoughts of a retired 
        CO: &quot;those are the bad boys and that's why they're there. Crime is 
        a big industry and it's too bad it's got to be that way.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the lower security institution, most of the prisoners 
        are black, says the warden, about a third Hispanic and less than ten percent 
        white. Most come from the inner city and few have family or friends in 
        the area.<br>
        A state senator hints at Huling's central point, by suggesting another 
        one. </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;This massive incarceration policy for your nonviolent 
        drug user or small time dealer,&quot; he says, &quot;does no useful things.&quot; 
        Huling would add one or two useful functions, however: keeping politicians 
        in office for appearing &quot;tough on crime&quot; and aiding small town 
        economies by expanding prison populations just enough to excuse the wide 
        distribution of small prisons across the landscape of rural America.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The documentary's points are as subtle as the misty rolling 
        hills of the Hudson River valley. Indeed, were it not for the appealing 
        small town characters of Coxsackie-across the river from Kinderhook, New 
        York-the hour and a half film would seem to drag, for the narrative thread 
        wears thin at several points.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While Huling suggests, in the documentary, that small town 
        economic development is the impetus for the boom in rural prison construction 
        over the last twenty years, she doesn't explain why she thinks it is a 
        more significant factor driving prison growth than the call to get &quot;tough 
        on crime&quot; through harsh drug laws. Indeed, these new prisons are 
        not sitting empty. </p>
      <p align="left">There is a very clear reason they are filling up and it 
        seems to be attacking the root of the problem-sending small time drug 
        offenders to prison rather than giving the treatment they need, so they 
        don't re-offend, would attack both recidivism and the problem of rural 
        economic dependence on recidivism.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Huling's economic focus does give her an interesting perspective 
        on the issue. Indeed, in her remarks after the video, she made a surprising 
        comparison, saying the job ghettos in the inner cities limit the potential 
        of their residents in the same way depressed rural areas restrict ambitions.<br>
        She suggested that the next step is to link urban people &quot;who want 
        to reduce incarceration,&quot; together with &quot;rural people interested 
        in sustainable economic development.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The problem is, of course, multifaceted and so is the solution. 
        Huling's research provides a good starting point for attacking the emerging 
        prison-industrial complex in rural America. Coupled with a renewed effort 
        to fight drug abuse through treatment and community-based solutions, her 
        suggestions might just pay off for the downtown ghetto-and the upstate 
        villages-alike.<br>
