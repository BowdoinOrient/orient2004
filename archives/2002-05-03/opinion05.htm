        <font size="2">HUGH HILL</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Well this will be my last column EVER for this lovely little 
        rag known as the Orient. Before the celebration begins, I want to deliver 
        my dying curse upon this institution that has swallowed four years of 
        my youth. Damn you Bowdoin! You've ruined my life, my tan, my sex appeal, 
        and my mental stability. I've been crushed, and my spirit's corpse lies 
        at your feet. You shall PAY! Damn YOU!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That was fun. Hehehe. No really, it was. In addition to 
        my departing curse, I would also like to offer a little reflection upon 
        the changes I have seen in my four years here. So grab a pillow, and get 
        ready for some serious attempts at geezing on my part (it gets funny by 
        the end). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When I first came to this college, political debate here 
        was rather dead. Granted the echoes of the political correctness movement's 
        attempts at mind control, thankfully vanquished, were still being felt, 
        but apathy was the word of the day. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Appalled, I would write ludicrous columns just to see if 
        I could push any buttons and get a response. Sometimes, I even got one. 
        Just to show you how whacky things were, one Bowdoin professor called 
        me &quot;Bowdoin's most dangerous conservative,&quot; because I dared 
        pose a difficult question to a famous &quot;liberal&quot; visiting lecturer. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It is sad when someone voicing a dissenting opinion is branded 
        a conservative. Come on liberals, throughout our history we have been 
        the dissenting opinion. I know Bowdoin provides a skewed lens of the dominance 
        of one view of liberalism, but that does not preclude the value of or 
        remove the necessity for dissent. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">We're getting better after the PC witch hunt, but I still 
        am bothered by the fact that it is easier to express a broader range of 
        opinions in front of conservatives today than liberals. Their time in 
        the wilderness (a.k.a. the 60s and 70s) did the conservatives some good 
        as it taught them the lesson liberals learned centuries ago, to tolerate 
        diverse opinions. At the risk of being facetious, liberals, open your 
        minds!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The level of discussion on this campus is definitely rising. 
        When I came here, this lovely publication was the only one. Now, we have 
        The Patriot and the Disorient raising the level, volume, and multiplicity 
        of perspectives on this campus. Discussion is progress. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Don't get me wrong, we're still quite apathetic. Yet some 
        progress is being made. I think this is a result of both social evolution 
        and a changing student body. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lamentably, people are partying less (according to insider 
        information, 25 percent fewer kegs were consumed at this year's Ivies 
        compared to last year). Many will applaud the reduced alcohol consumption, 
        but there is a definite downside to the social slowdown on campus. Gone 
        are the days when the entire campus went to one giant party at a frat 
        house. There is no unified campus social life, one of the great possibilities 
        at a school this size.<br>
        Our campus is fragmenting socially as students, banned from forming some 
        voluntary associations (fraternities), groping about to form their own 
        associations based on shared interests. The school's ham-handed attempt 
        at social engineering known as the social house system has only contributed 
        to the further balkanization of the student body (note the troubles faced 
        in filling many of the houses this year).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I can offer no solution other than for the administration 
        to treat the students like adults and let them govern their own social 
        lives. I don't see much future in the current system, so underclassmen, 
        it falls to you to scrap the social houses and replace them with something 
        more workable. Good luck.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As for me, I'm out of here. In four years, I've made amazing 
        friends, experienced brilliant faculty, and tried new and zesty things. 
        There's also still a lot I have not done. You'd think with only 1600 kids 
        you could do it all in four years, right? Hardly. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yet I'm ready to go. I'm sick of too much bureaucracy and 
        administration (though I don't think I'm ever going to escape that, at 
        least it won't be so pervasive in my personal life). <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It's also frickin' freezing and the sun hides for three 
        months. I've said it once and I'll say it a thousand times: we need to 
        come here during the summer when we can experience Maine when it's nice. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin College, I bid you adieu. It's been fun, it's been 
        boring, it's been educational, sometimes downright depressing, and sometimes 
        just right. I can't say college was what I expected it to be, and sure, 
        I'd do things differently if I could, but I can't. Thus, I leave you with 
        the phrase an annoying kid in my high school used to say: &quot;It's been 
        real,&quot; because here it has largely been everything but.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">P.S. You ain't seein' DIME ONE out of me in donations until 
        you comply with the following demands: 1) Change Thorne back to Wentworth: 
        If your name only stays up for a few decades what's the point in giving? 
        2) Give the rugby team more money and less grief; 'nuff said. 3) Add lashings 
        as an acceptable punishment and get rid of that weak-kneed social probation 
        crap. 4) Rename Res Life &quot;Party Facilitation Office&quot;: Register 
        a keg? Hell, kid, we're given 'em away this weekend! 5) Declare war on 
        Colby: They'll never suspect what hit 'em until it's too late. 6) Build 
        secret, underground Batcaves around campus and connect them with The Stowe 
        Memorial Underground Monorail System for student use. If they can spend 
        close to a million on some junky lights and mobiles for Thorne, they sure 
        as heck can do this. 7) Never force two people to live in the doubles 
        in Chamberlain: after freshman year, that's downright torture and I'm 
        still scarred from the experience.</p>
