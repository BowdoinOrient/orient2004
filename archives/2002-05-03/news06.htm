      <p>After the Faculty voted 45 to 29 last month to implement a plus/minus 
        grading system, various groups of students, including Student Government, 
        have waged campaigns to encourage the Faculty to reconsider the issue. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>A week after the vote, a forum was held at which students brainstormed 
        various paths to take. Some students wanted to focus on &quot;grandfathering&quot; 
        enrolled students into the current grading system, while others wanted 
        to have the Faculty reconsider the issue altogether. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Since then, a number of actions have been taken.<br>
      </p>
      <table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="2" align="right" bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
        <tr> 
          <td><img src="images/news07_plusminus.jpg" width="250" height="159"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td><font size="2">Students sign a petition urging a grandfathering 
            of current students out of the recently approved plus/minus system. 
            (Henry Coppola, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Student Government has sent letters to students urging them to talk to 
        their professors, in addition to letters to the faculty members asking 
        them to consider locking students into the grading system. The government 
        has not, however, supported efforts calling for a reconsideration of the 
        question of the plus/minus system as a whole. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Members of Student Government have also been trying to find a faculty 
        sponsor who will agree to bring the issue up at Monday's faculty meeting, 
        with the intention of adding to the already approved resolution an amendment 
        that would lock students into their current grade status. They are still 
        in the process of trying to find a faculty member to agree to do this.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In order for the issue to be reconsidered in any way, a faculty member 
        would have to make a motion at the next meeting. Since it is not new business, 
        said Student Congress member Jason Long '05, the Faculty would then have 
        to vote on whether it wanted to discuss the issue again.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Long said that in order to be successful in finding a faculty sponsor 
        and in convincing other members to reconsider the issue, new evidence 
        must be produced. &quot;We have new information,&quot; he said, referring 
        to the statistic that 84 percent of student respondents to a poll said 
        they wish to be locked into the current system. (Six hundred fifty-three 
        students voted; only first years, sophomores, and juniors were eligible 
        to vote.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Citing that students are often thought to be apathetic in College affairs, 
        Long said, &quot;We wouldn't be so apathetic if our opinions were taken 
        into account. We bear so little importance in general policy on campus.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>Long said he plans to rally the Faculty again in the fall to re-consider 
        the entire issue, even if nothing is accomplished at the meeting Monday.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;One message we want to send to professors is that we're not just 
        apathetic consumers that will easily change on the whims of the faculty, 
        in midstream,&quot; Long said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Andrea Larkin '03 and Heather Honiss '03 started a petition, which during 
        a two-day period gathered roughly 600 signatures. They presented the petition 
        to President Barry Mills. Mills, who supports the move to the plus/minus 
        system, said he has little power to cause a change in the Faculty's decision 
        and urged the students to present the petition to professors.<br>
        According to Long, the Student Congress was asked to endorse the petition, 
        but it declined to do so.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another group of students, organized by Selena McMahan '05, has also 
        taken action in hopes of having the Faculty revote on the plus/minus system 
        as a whole. McMahan and others involved have spent the last week gathering 
        student signatures on a large sheet of paper, which will be hung up at 
        a number of possible locations: outside the Faculty meeting Monday, or 
        anywhere students can see them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;We haven't counted the number of signatures yet but there is an 
        overwhelming majority against the plus/minus grading system,&quot; McMahan 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p>McMahan said that she sees the issue as indicative of poor communication 
        between students and faculty, and that in all her group's meetings it 
        has been clear that current students do not want this change to affect 
        them. She said, &quot;It's clear that though Bowdoin student all have 
        very different reasons for opposing plus/minus grades, very few students 
        want them to be implemented next year the way that right now they are 
        going to be.&quot;</p>
