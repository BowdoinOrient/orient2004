        <font size="2">KID WONGSRICHANALAI</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">For the past year our series has traveled from Bowdoin College's 
        19th century world to the battlefields of Mexico, Virginia, and the United 
        States Senate. Our series has focused on two individuals: one a senator 
        named William Pitt Fessenden, Class of 1823, the other a soldier and an 
        adventurer named Thomas Worchester Hyde, Class of 1861. We have also recounted 
        the stories of other Bowdoin graduates- Sam Fessenden, son of the Senator 
        who was a member of Hyde's graduating class, and Franklin Pierce, Class 
        of 1824, the pathetic man who was never capable of earning the office 
        of the Presidency, which he ascended to in 1853. These individuals were 
        one generation apart but they all lived the era of Civil War America and 
        contributed greatly to that time of uncertainty. </p>
      <p align="left">Each of their lives took a different path and the curtain 
        had to set sooner for some of them. The first to pass away was, ironically, 
        the youngest one, Sam Fessenden whose life was ended suddenly on the field 
        of Second Bull Run in 1862. As a passionate adventurer Sam had seen more 
        of America than many of his classmates for before he was a Bowdoin student 
        he had been a Union man, running away to Kansas to fight for freedom. 
        Always found where the danger was greatest his was the story of the tragedy 
        of war.<br>
        The next from this group to pass into the great unknown was Sam's father, 
        William Pitt Fessenden. Long a member of the United States Senate and 
        a man whose integrity was unquestionable, whose stubbornness was legendary, 
        the elderly Fessenden had led a life of pain and loneliness. </p>
      <p align="left">Fighting secessionists in the years before the Civil War, 
        arguing sense into radical Republicans and funding the War as the Chair 
        of the Senate Finance Committee during the early and middle part of the 
        Civil War, Fessenden became a member of Lincoln's cabinet in 1864 and 
        for eight months served as a capable Secretary of the Treasury. After 
        Lincoln's death Fessenden was branded a conservative for his refusal to 
        help convict President Andrew Johnson of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors.&quot; 
        Friends became foes in trying to get the Senator to swing his vote for 
        a &quot;guilty&quot; sentence. Despite pressure and threats to his life, 
        Fessenden remained firm in his convictions. Sacrificing his career to 
        see justice served, his &quot;not guilty&quot; vote helped to save Johnson 
        and the country from undergoing the consequences of a successful impeachment 
        trial. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many of Fessenden's friends, seeing him as a traitor to 
        the Party, continued to hold a grudge, especially in Maine. He remained, 
        however, a Republican and campaigned for Grant's election in 1868. He 
        continued in the Senate until 1869, doing his job as he saw fit, and regaining 
        the friendship of some old enemies. In April of 1869 he left Washington 
        for Maine and on September 8th, amidst a raging storm William Pitt Fessenden 
        passed away. The cause of death was a rupture in his lower intestine. 
        He was sixty-two years old.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Of Fessenden's career, future Speaker of the House of Representatives 
        Thomas Brackett Reed noted in a resolution to the Maine Senate:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>As a stateman [sic] he was a friend of liberty when her 
        friends were few. He was tried on many critical occasions and was equal 
        to all, and at last crowned a life of long service by steadfastly enduring 
        for what he thought right the reproaches of friends and the praise of 
        foes. The example of his stainless character and of the steady courage 
        with which he met obloquy for the sake of convictions, in its effect upon 
        the lives of those who come after him, will carry his influence and power 
        to centuries which his name may never reach.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">William Pitt Fessenden's story was one of sacrifice and 
        bold integrity.<br>
        Franklin Pierce's, unfortunately, was not. His life was marked by weakness 
        and personal tragedy. Of all the men we have brought forth in this series, 
        his future was the one with the most potential. He rose to the highest 
        office in the land and yet his failures overshadowed his very few achievements. 
        After his wife of thirty years died in December of 1863 he was left alone. 
        When in the following spring his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, himself 
        a Bowdoin graduate from the class of 1825, died, Pierce was left a broken 
        and disgraced man. Denied a place as one of Hawthorne's pallbearers due 
        to his outspoken position against the Northern war effort, Pierce was 
        branded a traitor and forgotten. He turned to the bottle and at the end 
        of his life found God before falling ill and dying on October 8, 1869, 
        a month after Fessenden.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In his last public address, Pierce said simply of his career, 
        &quot;I do not believe that I ever saw a day when I would not have made 
        any possible, personal sacrifice to maintain the Constitution of my country 
        and the Union based upon it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The last to pass away, from our select few, was Thomas W. 
        Hyde who was also the most successful of the group. Entering the Civil 
        War with great enthusiasm and vigor, Hyde emerged with even more faith 
        in the Union cause. He had few regrets during his years in the Army of 
        the Potomac- one of them was the tragic death of his commanding general 
        and friend, John Sedgwick, killed by a sniper at Spotsylvania in 1864. 
        In later years Hyde would write, &quot;I look on it now as my proudest 
        distinction that I was enabled to so serve with him [Sedgwick] while he 
        lived.&quot; Tom Hyde, the son of a wealthy merchant, himself to become 
        one of the richest men in Maine looked back at his life and admitted that 
        his greatest honor had not been the accumulation of his wealth but rather 
        the friendship of a man named Sedgwick.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Hyde remained a dedicated Republican and had a long list 
        of achievements after his war service- for which he was promoted to the 
        rank of brigadier general. He served as a mayor, a bank official, a state 
        senator, president of the Maine Senate, and a director of the Maine Central 
        Railroad. His greatest achievement, which earned him his fortune and his 
        spot in Maine history, however, was the founding of Bath Iron Works. In 
        1891, as a tribute to his actions at the Battle of Antietam, twenty-nine 
        years earlier, Hyde was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. The 
        inscription read:<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><i>HYDE, THOMAS W. <br>
        Rank and organization: Major, 7th Maine Infantry. Place and date: At Antietam, 
        Md., 17 September 1862. Entered service at: Bath, Maine. Birth: Italy. 
        Date of issue: 8 April 1891. Citation: Led his regiment in an assault 
        on a strong body of the enemy's infantry and kept up the fight until the 
        greater part of his men had been killed or wounded, bringing the remainder 
        safely out of the fight.</i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Always a force in his state while he was alive, Tom Hyde 
        departed from the world in 1899. He was fifty-eight years old. His story 
        was one of youthful energy and zeal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And so we close yet another series. As stated when this 
        journey began, my purpose was to bring to life the stories of Bowdoin's 
        lesser-known personalities, who in some way had a hand in the Civil War. 
        Hopefully the journey has been informative for you, the reader. But I 
        have failed to tell you the entire story of their lives and also of the 
        lives of the hundreds of Bowdoin men who were alive and participated in 
        the War Between North and South. No newspaper series can hope to do that. 
        It should simply be remembered that from these halls there emerged many 
        generations who played prominent and not so prominent roles in their times. 
        Like us, those soldiers, writers, politicians, and scientists, marched 
        forth from Bowdoin College, sought out their paths in life, did the best 
        they could with their ability and, in turn, made their alma mater proud.<br>
