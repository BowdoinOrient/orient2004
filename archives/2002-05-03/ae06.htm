      <p align="left">When the original Star Wars trilogy came to a close in 1983 
        with &quot;Return of the Jedi,&quot; the movie series was already a cultural 
        landmark, making fans out of children and adults alike. However, rumor 
        had it that Lucas was not done with Star Wars; after all, the movies began 
        with Episode IV, leaving 3 movies open to tell the story of the rise of 
        the evil Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">For fifteen long years these fans waited for these prequels 
        to come to fruition, even as the cultural force that is Star Wars gained 
        more and more steam. In 1999 their prayers were answered, as moviemaking 
        technology finally reached a level high enough for George Lucas to fulfill 
        his original vision of the history of the Star Wars galaxy. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now with the impending release of the second prequel to 
        the original trilogy, &quot;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,&quot; 
        anticipation runs high both on the Bowdoin campus and across the nation. 
        The release date of May 16 falls near the end of exams for us here at 
        Bowdoin, and many see it as a welcome way to end the year. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Meanwhile, Star Wars fans from all around are coming out 
        of the woodwork ahead of the release: snatching up action figures, downloading 
        trailers, buying advance tickets and generally getting everything possible 
        out of the Episode II experience but the movie itself. One famous story 
        is of a pair of Seattle fans who lined up to camp outside their local 
        theater for the release four months in advance, without even knowing if 
        the theater would show the movie at all.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But fandom is a funny thing, and despite all the excitement 
        the preparations seem to be considerably more reserved than they were 
        for &quot;Episode I.&quot; The hype for that installment, the first since 
        &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; in 1983, reached a fever pitch of marketing 
        tie-ins and overexposure, leading many to be let down by what is generally 
        considered to be a weak addition to the series. Fans blasted the movie 
        for failing to live up to expectations, focusing their rage especially 
        (and perhaps unfairly) on the bumbling, pseudo-Caribbean alien Jar Jar 
        Binks. Though it made over $400 million in North American ticket sales, 
        the movie was generally considered to be a disappointment, leaving many 
        to doubt that future prequels would ever live up to the original trilogy.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, Lucasfilm seems to have learned from its mistakes 
        this time around. &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; focuses on the beginnings 
        of the rise of the Galactic Empire and the fall of Anakin Skywalker, and 
        thus promises to be somewhat darker and to have more emotional depth than 
        its predecessor did. In addition, the Star Wars marketing juggernaut will 
        be more reigned in this time. The hype leading up to the release has been 
        toned down significantly: in the words of Howard Roffman, president of 
        Lucas Licensing, &quot;We learned... that Star Wars does not need awareness 
        building.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It doesn't hurt that Jar Jar will play a much more minor 
        role in the second film than in the first.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The question remains, however: &quot;Will Episode II be 
        any good?&quot; That's a question that only the release can answer. Though 
        many fans have mixed feelings about how things may turn out, nearly any 
        will admit that despite their worries, it's still Star Wars. No matter 
        how things turn out, it will be a movie release to remember.</p>
