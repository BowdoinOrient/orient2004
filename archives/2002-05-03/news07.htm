      <p align="left"> Bowdoin will see a number of new faces in various administrative 
        positions next year, with a number of administrators moving on to other 
        jobs or retiring. The searches for a new treasurer and a new assistant 
        dean of Student Affairs are nearing completion, while the search for a 
        new director of Facilities will begin soon.<br>

      <p align="left">The search committee to find a replacement for Treasurer 
        Kent Chabotar, who will leave Bowdoin in June to become the president 
        of Guilford College, is still in the process of interviewing candidates.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;I am optimistic we will identify a treasurer in the 
        next few weeks, but it is most important that we find the right person 
        for the job. There are many interesting candidates out there, but we are 
        being thoughtful and deliberate in our considerations,&quot; President 
        Barry Mills, who chairs the committee, said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the interval, Director of Budgets Gerald Boothby will 
        be here for much of the summer working with Controller Nigel Bearman to 
        cover any transitional period. Boothby will also be leaving Bowdoin later 
        this summer to take over as director of finance at Elizabethtown College.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The committee had originally hoped to have chosen a new 
        candidate by early April. Mills said that they did find one person from 
        New York City who was very interested in the job and in whom the committee 
        was very interested, but who decided in the end that for personal reasons 
        she couldn't move to Maine.<br>

      <p align="left">The committee to find a replacement for Assistant Dean of 
        Student Affairs Mya Mangawang, who will leave to pursue a Ph.D. in art 
        history at Bryn Mawr College, has narrowed down the initial pool of 113 
        applicants to four finalists. Two of the candidates interviewed this past 
        week; the other two will be interviewed next week. The interview process 
        involves a dinner with members of the search committee and then a full 
        day of interviews with students, faculty, and staff.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Associate Dean of Student Affairs Tim Foster, 
        who chairs the committee, the &quot;incredibly talented&quot; applicant 
        pool has &quot;more depth than I have seen in any of the other searches 
        with which I have been involved at Bowdoin.&quot; The pool includes current 
        staff, faculty, alumni, and people from across the U.S. and from several 
        foreign countries, as well.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;We will have some difficult decisions to make, but 
        the strength of the pool assures me that we will be able to hire an exceptional 
        person,&quot; Foster said.<br>
        The committee will consider feedback on the interviewers when it meets 
        next Friday, and it will likely make an offer the following Monday, May 
        13, after checking references, Foster said. If all goes according to plan, 
        the College may be able to make an announcement by May 20.<br>

      </p>
      <p align="left">Gardiner will retire from the College on June 30, but will 
        continue to work with the College as a consultant on the Chapel Towers 
        project through the end of 2002, working out of his home. &quot;We're 
        very fortunate that we'll have his expertise to assist us with the work 
        on the chapel tower repairs,&quot; Torrey said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Torrey said he hopes to have a job description ready and 
        a search committee in place by the middle of May, and hopes to have a 
        director named in the fall.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Other College administrators leaving include two assistant 
        directors of Residential Life. Kim Pacelli will head to Harvard to pursue 
        a Master's degree in education, and David Mountcastle will work as an 
        admissions staffer for the Leysin American School in Switzerland.</p>
