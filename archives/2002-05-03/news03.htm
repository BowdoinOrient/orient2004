      </p>
      <p align="left">One month following the Faculty's decision to implement 
        a plus/minus grading system, the Faculty will once again be making a decision 
        regarding grading at Bowdoin. This time, they will be voting on whether 
        or not to calculate GPAs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin's current policy- which dates back to the Vietnam 
        War era when GPAs were used to determine draftees- prohibits the calculation 
        of GPAs, except in order to determine which students qualify as Sarah 
        and James Bowdoin scholars and which students qualify for Latin honors.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Recording Committee presented its proposal to re-institute 
        the calculation of GPAs at the April faculty meeting. Faculty members 
        will vote on the proposal at their May meeting on Monday. If the Faculty 
        votes in favor of the measure, GPAs will appear on transcripts no later 
        than this fall.<br>
        According to physics professor Stephen Naculich, chair of the Recording 
        Committee, &quot;Many students and employers would like the College to 
        provide this information, and placing the GPA on the transcript would 
        be an 'official' way of disseminating this information.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Mark Lucci '04, a student representative on 
        the Recording Committee, the issue has taken a backseat to the plus/minus 
        debate, but the Recording Committee has been discussing it for almost 
        a full year. The proposal was originally brought up by Director of Institutional 
        Research and Registrar Christine Brooks Cote on behalf of the Office of 
        Student Records.<br>
        In a recent memo circulated by the Recording Committee to members of the 
        Faculty, the main reason that was cited for proposing to end the ban on 
        the calculation of GPAs was that &quot;the very office [the Office of 
        Student Records] that has administrative authority over grades and academic 
        records is not calculating GPA, while others on campus are calculating 
        and reporting GPA.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the memo, a number of individuals request student 
        GPAs, including scholarship agencies, graduate schools, off-campus study 
        programs, vehicle insurance companies, and the students themselves. <br>
        Because the College does not officially compute GPAs, when a request is 
        made for a GPA, students or faculty members often will either calculate 
        it on their own or forward on an official transcript. Employers and graduate 
        schools who receive a transcript without a GPA, though, also often calculate 
        it on their own.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to the Recording Committee's memo, the problem 
        with this is that GPAs that are calculated independently of the school 
        are prone to errors and complications, especially those arising from how 
        to count half-credit and pass/fail courses. The addition of pluses and 
        minuses will only increase the potential for error as people attempt to 
        determine how many points to assign to a B+.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Another problem identified by the memo is that of confidentiality. 
        Although the Office of Student Records understands the privacy laws regarding 
        the release of academic records, other members of the Bowdoin community 
        who choose to release GPAs on their own may not.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The memo identified three options for resolving these problems. 
        The first, which is the option being recommended to the Faculty by the 
        Recording Committee, is to change the College's policy such that a GPA 
        would be calculated for each student. This GPA would then appear on the 
        student's transcript, in his or her academic records, and on any other 
        documents in which GPA was requested. According to the memo, this would 
        allow the Office of Student Records to be the official calculator of GPAs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second option being presented to the Faculty, although 
        not being endorsed by the Recording Committee, is to &quot;affirm our 
        current policy of not calculating GPA.&quot; If this were accepted, then 
        no college official would be allowed to compute or report GPAs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A third option mentioned in the memo but rejected by the 
        Recording Committee is that of calculating GPAs for internal purposes 
        only. According to the memo, this is not a viable option because most 
        of the pressure to compute GPA comes from external sources, not internal.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lucci said that with the implementation of plus/minus grades 
        and now the proposal to calculate GPAs, certain ideas that have previously 
        been fundamental in forming grading policies-that students learn for reasons 
        other than grades and that GPAs do not really matter&frac34;are fading. 
        He cited a Bowdoin Magazine article in which a student was praised because 
        of his GPA, although according to the College, he was not officially supposed 
        to have a GPA in the first place. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Lucci said that historically the Faculty has questioned 
        whether or not a student's GPA is capable of summing up his or her educational 
        experience since it does not take into account things such as the difficulty 
        level of courses. He questioned if the idea that &quot;students are indeed 
        the average of all grades earned&quot; was the message that the College 
        wanted to be sending to students.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even if the Faculty does decide to allow the calculation 
        of GPAs, the prohibition against calculating class rank will still be 
        enforced. </p>
