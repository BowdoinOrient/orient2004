      <p align="left">Bowdoin softball extended its win streak to five games last 
        weekend and heads to the NESCAC tournament at Williams tomorrow.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Last Saturday, the Bears clawed and scratched at Trinity, 
        coming from behind to win both games in the doubleheader, 2-1 and 9-2. 
        The first featured Jessie Poulin '02 on the mound for six innings, with 
        Erin Hanley '04 swooping into the game in the seventh to pick up the win.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Senior Jessie Mayol started off the game-winning rally with 
        a dominating double. Jordan Alper '02 followed her up with a well-timed 
        walk and Katie Sheridan '02 came up huge again for the Bears, knocking 
        Mayol in for the winning run.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the second matchup of the day, in front of a much-spirited 
        crowd, the Bears came through again in the clutch. Seniors Kristie Miller 
        and Emily Rizza capped a frenzy of Bowdoin activity at bat, picking up 
        game-leading RBIs.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">On a cold, wet day, hands were frozen, feet sunk, and tears 
        were shed, but the Bowdoin women earned a berth in the NESCAC tournament 
        for the second year in a row. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The Bears came from behind to defeat Colby 5-4. Poulin pitched 
        her way to her 11th win of the season, setting the record for most wins 
        in a season. It marked her 29th career win, also a school record.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Early in the game, Bowdoin fell behind 4-1. A complete team 
        effort allowed the Bears to chip at the lead, aided by runs from Mayol 
        and Michelle Jackson '03.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the bottom of the seventh, the score was 4-3. Rizza fought 
        the not-so-pleasant April showers and smacked a single, bringing the crowd 
        to its feet. Britney Carr '04 bunted and hustled it out to earn a base 
        hit. Again, Alper came up strong for Bowdoin by reaching base on a walk 
        and advancing the runners.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Rachael Gordon '05 lived up to her &quot;Flash&quot; nickname, 
        beating out a grounder to short and allowing Rizza to score, tying the 
        game. The Colby pitcher threw a wild pitch and Carr took advantage, slip-sliding 
        into home and sealing the game for the frozen white Beasties from Brunswick.<br>
        This Bear season, with any luck, is not nearly over yet. When the end 
        does come, Bowdoin softball will say goodbye to eight seniors who have 
        brought the program to new heights. Each has blended her own individual 
        style and personality with those of her teammates.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Peers describe Gina Laugelli as crazy, a born leader, and 
        a great pitcher; &quot;the epitome of a great captain.&quot; While she 
        has been known to tell off maids at sketchy motels, and claims that &quot;Dawn 
        made us do these horrible sit up exercises and I cheated all the time,&quot; 
        Gina truly is an inspiration in her softball accomplishments, and believes 
        that &quot;any team can be beaten on any given day.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Katie Sheridan was a late addition to the team, joining 
        as a sophomore. She is known as an &quot;animal,&quot; but also as a fun 
        sidekick to the pitchers and a versatile athlete. Poulin says, &quot;Geez, 
        I don't know what I would do without Katie. She's the smartest catcher 
        I've ever had. She wants to win and does whatever she can.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of Emily Rizza's favorite memories came last year during 
        the NESCAC tournament. &quot;We sang at the top of our lungs; a cheesy 
        rip off of a cheesy song, but everybody was there&#133;.We were prepared 
        to go out with so much confidence, like we had nothing to lose. There 
        was such a feeling of togetherness.&quot; Rizza herself is known as both 
        &quot;easy to embarrass&quot; and &quot;exactly what every teammate and 
        coach would want in a player.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Michelle Jackson will be abandoning not only the seat of 
        fundraising guru and the &quot;voice of reason,&quot; but also that of 
        the second basemen who perfected the &quot;Jackson Double Play.&quot; 
        She is the heart and soul of the team, saying &quot;I truly believe that 
        you should hang out and bond with your team off the field. And always 
        keep long underwear, a hat and gloves in your bag. Maybe even a raincoat 
        and hand warmers.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jessie Mayol would, according to two sources, admittedly 
        &quot;eat shit if it was fried.&quot; Needless to say, teammates view 
        the shortstop (who loves to fake a throw to first and catch the runner 
        as she tries for third) as both &quot;unique&quot; and &quot;full of energy.&quot; 
        Known for her athletic ability and willingness to &quot;always cross the 
        line.&quot;&quot;Every year, this softball program has become stronger 
        and stronger,&quot; she says. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kristie Miller, with a large base of fans who love her home 
        runs, will be remembered as a fantastic batter and competitor, but also 
        as the girl who &quot;wouldn't tell anyone she had a migraine and she 
        couldn't see out of one of her eyes because she didn't was to complain.&quot; 
        Both a rock and a person who is &quot;funny in a weird, witty sense,&quot; 
        her strength also lies in the way she &quot;keeps a straight face when 
        trying to trick you into believing something.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jordan Alper is the lone pure outfielder of the pack, and 
        in fact, the entire team-making key her &quot;focus, playing with the 
        dandelions, and being cold,&quot; she says. She is described as &quot;a 
        true softball player, making crazy catches and possessing a hitter's attitude.&quot; 
        Miller remembers, &quot;I was very intimidated by her as a freshman, then 
        I realized I was much taller.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jessie Poulin gained the title of &quot;odd duck,&quot; 
        but &quot;she'll take one off the shin in the exact same spot six times 
        and still throw the runner out,&quot; Rizza says. Poulin has the ability 
        to make everyone laugh, and all who have seen her pitch will most miss 
        what is forever known as &quot;the Grunt.&quot; You can run, you can hide, 
        but you can't escape &quot;the Grunt.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">These eight individuals forever changed the program. The 
        traditions they leave and the ideals they represent are as permanent as 
        the records they have set. Laugelli sums it up: &quot;The collectivity 
        of the class is an honor to be a part of. It was this freak accident that 
        we were all thrown together and I feel truly fortunate and lucky to be 
        a part of the eight.&quot;</p>
