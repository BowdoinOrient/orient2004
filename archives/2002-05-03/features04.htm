      <p align="left"><font size="5">Military tribunals: are they fair?<br>
        <font size="2">RICHARD A. WILEY</font><font size="2"><br>
        FACULTY CONTRIBUTOR</font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Last fall President Bush published a &quot;military&quot; 
        order, under his specific Commander-in-Chief powers in Article II, designating 
        military tribunals as the &quot;courts&quot; in which to try those who 
        perpetrated the September 11 attack. The President's order was not an 
        Executive Order, under his general Article II powers, as the Chief Executive 
        of the United States. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In January, the Administration, taking into account many 
        criticisms, published an implementing Department of Defense Military Order.<br>
        Both orders raise both policy and legal questions such as: &quot;Whom 
        do we prosecute, where do we prosecute them, and under what procedures 
        and what standards do we attempt to prosecute them?&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To answer these questions, three audiences must be taken 
        into account. First, the primary purpose of the attack on the United States 
        on September 11 appears to have been to have the United States react in 
        a way which would contribute to further inflaming the general populations 
        in the moderate Muslim countries, particularly the Saudi Arabian population, 
        so as to destabilize, and enable the fundamentalists to overthrow, those 
        governments. We should not contribute to that inflammation.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The second audience is &quot;our allies.&quot; We cannot 
        ask them to assist us in prosecuting terrorism (and this may well be a 
        fifty-year effort) and at the same time seek to prosecute individuals 
        in a way that is totally offensive to our allies.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">And, of course, the third audience is &quot;the citizens 
        of the United States.&quot; Because we have been the victims of this attack, 
        the Administration must reasonably satisfy American public opinion. No 
        one would argue that someone, if not the United States itself, has the 
        legal right to prosecute the individuals involved for what has been done. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">There are five &quot;forums&quot; in which prosecution could 
        take place. In the sense of a &quot;spectrum&quot; (no political implication), 
        on the left, prosecutions could take place in foreign national courts. 
        Second, of course, are the military tribunals proposed by the Administration. 
        Third, the established military courts martial system. Fourth, the regular 
        United States District Courts (the Article III courts), and, finally, 
        at the extreme right, the possibility of a special international tribunal. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As far as foreign courts are concerned, the Administration 
        has suggested that some of the individuals involved may be prosecuted 
        in various foreign jurisdictions. This alternative would produce the problem 
        of different legal systems, different due process requirements, and the 
        potential for inconsistency. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With regard to an international criminal court, some observers 
        have proposed that a court be established with a rather large bench, with 
        representation from Muslim countries as well, to accommodate the first 
        audience's perceptual requirements. This alternative is not realistic. 
        The Bush Administration, as was the Clinton Administration, is strongly 
        opposed-except in unique circumstances-to international criminal courts. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As a practical matter, of the five theoretical alternatives, 
        the three in the &quot;middle&quot; remain: military tribunals; regular 
        courts martial; or the use of the United States District Courts. In this 
        context, it is helpful to consider the concerns of the Administration 
        which have led them to the military tribunal alternative.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">First, has been safety and security in terms of judge, juror 
        and courthouse protection. Second is secrecy-in two senses. One is in 
        the intelligence sense of protecting classified information and preventing 
        the disclosure of intelligence sources and methods. More generally is 
        a feeling that the whole procedure simply ought to be kept secret. Second, 
        concern over the slow pace of the regular courts. The original proposal 
        for the use of military tribunals came from the first Bush Administration 
        Attorney General William Barr's concern with the slowness of the prosecution 
        of the Lockerbie bombers. Lockerbie was not a precedent; necessary concessions 
        had to be extracted from the government of Libya over ten years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Other concerns of the Administration: wanting to have looser 
        standards for admission of evidence; obviously, a greater likelihood that 
        the death penalty might be imposed; not to afford a propaganda forum for 
        the defendants; and Attorney General Ashcroft's early statement that he 
        didn't want to have &quot;grandstanding&quot; lawyers. To its credit, 
        the Administration, based on public criticisms, has come far since the 
        Presidential order was published in the fall. For example, concessions 
        have been made on the burden of proof &frac34; it now must be beyond a 
        reasonable doubt. However, standards of evidence have, for example, been 
        left loose- offensive to the other two audiences &frac34; the Muslim masses 
        and our allies abroad.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A more appropriate partial compromise would be to use the 
        established law under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which has 
        been in existence since 1950. There are clear rights of appeal, which 
        is another matter subject to doubt in the various orders published to 
        date. Courts martial can move at a relatively rapid pace; time delay is 
        not a factor. Evidentiary concerns can be avoided; the rules of evidence 
        in courts martial are largely the same as in the District Courts. Very 
        importantly, there is a serious question whether specific congressional 
        authority is required to institute military tribunals absent a declared 
        war. There is already standing congressional authority for courts martial 
        to have concurrent jurisdiction over offenses of the type being dealt 
        with here.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Finally, regular United States District Courts. Those courts 
        have historically tried terrorists, slave-traders and pirates- those regarded 
        as beyond the pale of civilized behavior. The District Courts have already 
        dealt successfully with the 1993 original World Trade Center bombing. 
        Further, two cases were decided within the last year by Judge Sand in 
        the Southern District of New York- each entitled United States v. Osama 
        Bin Laden, which arose out of the two African embassy bombings in 1998. 
        On questions of security, District Courts regularly try criminal cases 
        involving organized crime. </p>
      <p align="left">Further, the Classified Information Procedures Act would 
        enable a Federal district judge to limit public access to sensitive information. 
        District Courts can certainly move quickly if the circumstances warrant. 
        And, in fact, District Courts do impose death penalties, as in the Oklahoma 
        City bombing case. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the very beginning, the administration had two choices: 
        it could proceed under the regular criminal laws, or it could take the 
        position that the United States is at war and, in effect, seek to use 
        the military tribunal alternative. </p>
      <p align="left">The best resolution- what the Administration is, in fact, 
        doing in order to minimize Constitutional challenges- is to make a decision 
        very carefully case-by-case, based upon: the nature of the charges; where 
        the person was apprehended; where the person is going to be tried; and 
        who exactly is being accused- a member of the Taliban military, or a member 
        of Al Qaeda. The District Courts can be used if a person being prosecuted: 
        was lawfully present in the United States, whether as a citizen or an 
        alien, at the time of the crime; is being prosecuted for violation of 
        the regular criminal laws; or is being apprehended or tried in the United 
        States. And the converse is also true- regular courts martial, under the 
        Uniform Code of Military Justice, can be used if: the trial is of a non-US 
        citizen, or an alien not lawfully present, for violation of the laws of 
        war; and the individual involved has been apprehended and is being tried 
        outside the United States. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What is important is not just to see that justice is done, 
        but that the world perceives that justice is done. </p>
