            tour. (Karsten Moran, <i>Bowdoin Orient</i>)</font></td>

      <p align="left">Members of the Bowdoin community toured the campus in wheelchairs 
        and on crutches Tuesday on a route designed to point out the inaccessibility 
        of various campus buildings to handicapped individuals.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The tour highlighted a few, although not all, of the areas 
        around campus that are especially not conducive to handicapped individuals, 
        including the Dudley Coe Health Center, the first-year dorms, and Banister 
        Hall, which is also supposed to provide handicapped access the Chapel.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">At the Dudley Coe Health Center, there is no wheelchair 
        ramp access. In addition, the close proximity of the several doors in 
        the entrance area would make it very difficult for a handicapped individual 
        to gain entry to the building even if there was a wheelchair ramp.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The first-year dorms are also inaccessible in general, and 
        the problem is even more substantial at Appleton Hall where the security 
        phone would be a far reach for someone in a wheelchair.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Banister Hall, which also provides access to the Chapel, 
        has a wheelchair ramp, but after pressing the handicap button to open 
        the door, there is not enough time to get up the ramp and inside the building 
        before the door closes. In addition, a person in a wheelchair would not 
        be able to use the bathroom just inside the building.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The tour was sponsored by FORWARD!, a disabilities awareness 
        student group led by Jaica Kinsman '99, and Team Zhara, the mock election 
        campaign sponsor of Zhara Malstedt '02. Approximately 20 people, including 
        President Barry Mills, Director of Residential Life Bob Graves, Coordinator 
        of Multicultural Student Programs Wil Smith, and Secretary of Student 
        Activities Sue Burtt, went on the tour.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Malstedt, the tour was the first of its kind 
        at Bowdoin.<br>
        Malstedt became an advocate for handicapped accessibility after she was 
        temporarily disabled herself. She said, &quot;I've heard people say that 
        the lack of accessibility does not affect them or 'there are no people 
        in wheelchairs here.' My answer to that is, who knows what is going to 
        happen to you tomorrow. You could be in an accident and disabled permanently 
        or temporarily. Athletes are injured all the time.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Malstedt also noted that the reason there are no handicapped 
        people at Bowdoin is because the lack of accessibility would not allow 
        them to function normally on campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Director of Accommodations for Students with Disabilities 
        Joann Canning said that as far as she is aware, there has never been a 
        student in a wheelchair who has chosen to come to Bowdoin in the recent 
        memory of the College or since the Americans with Disabilities Act was 
        put in place. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">According to Canning, &quot;The walk yesterday was meant 
        to open peoples' eyes to the need for greater attention to access on campus 
        for people with mobility challenges&#133;.My hope is that yesterday's 
        walk will have the [decision makers] put accessible renovations higher 
        up on the priority list.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The wheelchairs and crutches used on the walk were loaned 
        by area hospitals and pharmacies.</p>
