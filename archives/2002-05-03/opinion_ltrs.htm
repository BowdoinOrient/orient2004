      <p align="left"><font size="5">Characterization of houses unfair</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>We were disappointed to read the recent Orient characterization of the 
        college house system as a failure. You have devalued the successes achieved 
        by the houses and underestimated the potential for this system to evolve.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The strength of each house varies from year to year depending upon the 
        continuity of upperclass leadership. Despite these fluctuations, the houses 
        put on successful programming events each year. Boody Street, for example, 
        had a small number of leaders this year. They rose to the challenge and 
        put on many great events including the annual Broomball tournament, several 
        parties including the popular Halloween party, barbeques, a trip to the 
        Portland Museum of Art, study breaks, a dinner with the former Director 
        of Naval Intelligence, a trip to Yankee Lanes with faculty, and dozens 
        of others.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Boody Street residents are just a few of the dozens of house leaders 
        who spend hours entertaining the rest of campus. Their efforts are tireless 
        and often thankless. Hundreds of students flock to their parties without 
        offering even once during their four years at Bowdoin to help run a party 
        at their affiliated house.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Another popular critique of the houses (and seen in an Orient editorial 
        this year) is that they only serve as sites for campus-wide parties. Again, 
        this unfairly overlooks the variety of programming underway, including 
        community service (Habitat for Humanity, United Way, local schools, Adopt-a-Family, 
        etc.), intramural teams, Loose Leaves, movie nights, Inter-House Olympics, 
        the chem-free weekend, faculty dinners, and the scavenger hunt, to name 
        only a fraction of this year's events.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the gesture of credit given to house residents in your editorial, 
        you have overlooked the improvements in the social and intellectual climate 
        at Bowdoin. Several of us have been around here long enough to see that 
        Bowdoin is more lively and interesting now than it was five years ago. 
        Current and former house leaders deserve some of the credit for affecting 
        this change.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Perhaps the houses need to better publicize their willingness and need 
        for more affiliates to get involved. We remind the system's critics that 
        the houses belong to students, not to administrators, and that they are 
        dynamic organizations that require input and energy from all corners of 
        campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We hope that rather than undermining the houses' achievements, the Orient 
        will challenge all Bowdoin students to take a more active role in shaping 
        the house system.</p>

      </p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Congratulations on your excellent coverage of the College House system 
        in the April 26 issue. The Orient has been much less biased towards college 
        houses ever since those bitter ADPs left.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, please allow me to clarify some important points for the student 
        body. The Orient is wrong to think that the college houses serve only 
        those who live in them. Think about the &quot;Road Wars&quot; charity 
        bike race this past weekend. Does the United Way live at Baxter? Think 
        about all the art openings, the scholarly speakers, and the events like 
        &quot;The Game of Life&quot; project for the women's studies capstone 
        course that have been sponsored by college houses. How could all those 
        people who benefitted from or attended these events live in a college 
        house, let alone fit inside?<br>
      </p>
      <p>Does the Orient believe that the system &quot;seems to work consistently 
        only to satisfy the small number of people who live there?&quot; College 
        house events range in size from intimate to campus-wide. There are always 
        students from all classes and residencies who attend them.<br>
      </p>
      <p>While we are not the center of social life on campus, college houses 
        are the only part of Bowdoin's social life that is open to all. The house 
        events that took place this year might not have given everything to everyone, 
        but they gave all to those who asked. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Hands down, the best way to orgainize an event on campus is through the 
        houses. As an affiliate, you have 20-plus highly motivated individuals 
        with intimate knowledge of Bowdoin's inflated bureaucracy at your fingertips. 
        There's also a lot of money just waiting to be spent. <br>
      </p>
      <p>If you don't see anything you like going on at your house, turn off your 
        Play Station2, think up a really good away message for your AIM, and go 
        to a house meeting. From bringing up you favorite band to having your 
        professor give a slide show to opening up a restaurant, the house system 
        can work for you if you want it to.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The ultimate survival of the houses lies not with the trustees and administrators, 
        but with the students. The old folks might have a lot of juice with the 
        bigwigs, but they don't have the power to motivate student interest. It 
        would be a shame to see this thing fail, concidering how much potential 
        there is. In the next few years, we'll see if the student body is willing 
        to carry the system from its infancy to adulthood. It's not going to be 
        carried for you.</p>

      </p>
      <p align="left">To the Editors:</p>
      <p>Student Government, in conjunction with Dining Services, is proud to 
        announce that Thorne Dining Hall will be open for late-night dining from 
        10:30 p.m. until 1:30 a.m. on May 12, 13, and 14, the first three days 
        of exams. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The results of the late night dining survey you filled out have been 
        taken into account in this trial run of on-campus late night dining. The 
        menu includes bagels, toast, English muffins, graham crackers and all 
        toppings, cinnamon rolls, assorted seasonal fruit, assorted ice cream 
        novelties, veggie platters, nacho chips and cheese, assorted cereals, 
        and assorted hot and cold beverages. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The late-night meal option will be included in all board plans as a normal 
        meal.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Student Government is very excited about this new meal offering from 
        Dining Services and hopes this trial will be a success so that late night 
        dining can become permanent next fall. Feel free to voice your opinion 
        about this on the comment cards in each of the dining halls. <br>
      </p>
      <p>We would like to thank everyone on Dining Services and CIS for their 
        hard work to make this happen. </p>

      <p align="left">To The Editors:</p>
      <p>Professor Levine's letter [&quot;Faculty shouldn't represent public opinion,&quot; 
        26 April 2002] explained that various liberal academic views have been 
        good for the world, but he omitted mention of any valuable contributions 
        made by what are thought of as conservative ideas. A fair historian would 
        have credited conservative heroes in England such as Adam Smith and Winston 
        Churchill for the intellectual questioning and critical thinking that 
        created capitalism, stopped the Nazis, and spread democracy behind the 
        Iron Curtain in Eastern Europe.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, conservatives did not act alone to create the capitalist 
        standard of living we enjoy today, nor did they win World War II or dismantle 
        the Gulags all by themselves. Conservatives led these movements by collaborating&#133;with 
        liberals. Adam Smith's free market ideas mixed well with the more socialist 
        ideas of Keynes in our economy. Churchill the conservative collaborated 
        with Roosevelt. Reagan is forever linked in history with Gorbachev, the 
        Russian liberal. </p>
      <p>All Gil Barndollar was asking for in his piece [&quot;College faculty 
        out of touch with U.S.,&quot; 19 April 2002] was a collaboration in academia 
        between liberal and conservative thinkers. It is interesting to reflect 
        every now and then on whether it's right to have all male or all white 
        or all liberal professors dominating college faculties. </p>
      <p>Professor Levine noted that some conservatives opposed democracy in the 
        18th century. He also knows that despite their gift for critical thinking 
        and questioning, some liberals supported communism as both a theory and 
        in the specific practices of Lenin and Stalin in the 20th century. </p>
      <p>Barndollar's piece critically questioned whether or not Ivy League colleges 
        really provide stimulating intellectual environments if liberals outnumber 
        conservatives in faculties by 64 to 66 percent. Conservative intellectuals 
        have made some powerful contributions that Professor Levine probably points 
        out in the balanced presentations he makes to his classes.</p>
