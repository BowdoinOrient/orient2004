        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p>Last week was a relatively slow news week. For the first time in months, 
        violence in the Middle East calmed a bit, and America seemed captivated 
        by the Pope's radical statement that sexual assault is a criminal act 
        according to both God and society. However, an important lesson for the 
        country and our graduating seniors blossomed to the front page last Monday.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It was the story of the resignation of Karen Hughes, one of President 
        Bush's most trusted political advisors. What made her decision shocking 
        was that she had worked for Bush since his campaign for governor of Texas 
        in 1994. Her stated reason for leaving was a desire to spend more time 
        with her teenage son and her husband, a prominent Washington lawyer. Even 
        though this explanation is often disingenuous in the world of politics, 
        many commentators embraced Hughes's reason as both genuine and indicative 
        of a positive consequence of September 11. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, many people discussed their 
        own introspections and reflections on life. People returned to churches 
        and attempted to rekindle lost romances when the reality of life's brittle 
        nature rose to the forefront of our collective minds. Families and pastimes 
        dwarfed careers and ambition. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Peggy Noonan of The Wall Street Journal wrote last Friday that September 
        11 made her &quot;hungrier for life&#133;more tenderly toward it and more 
        grateful&#133;you want to really feel and experience it and smell it and 
        touch and thank God for it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is Ms. Noonan's definition of life that resonates the most with me 
        as this year comes to an end. I am watching a senior class that I know 
        is well-prepared to exchange the Hedonistic diversions of college life 
        for the austere realities of jobs or graduate schools. Also, I am realizing 
        that next year will be &quot;my turn,&quot; and that the vast world of 
        uncertainty will then rest upon my shoulders. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Here is where I lean on Noonan's affirmation of the importance of the 
        petites bonheures of life. She explains, &quot;Life is putting on coffee, 
        picking up the newspaper, putting on the radio and listening for a few 
        seconds to see if something huge and terrible happened last night.&quot; 
        Once it is determined that the state of the world is still in order, one 
        can resume indulging in the minor yet reassuring activities that define 
        our lives. <br>
      </p>
      <p>My life is defined less by repetitive activities and more by grand spaces. 
        Just as Noonan values her morning coffee or the bird feeder outside her 
        New York apartment, I yearn for the meditative stimulations from specific 
        physical locations. For me, it is standing on a causeway that runs between 
        my secluded neighborhood and the more populous downtown area.<br>
      </p>
      <p>I recall the refreshing sensation I received as a young adolescent as 
        I walked home from school on late spring days, popping through the woods 
        and seeing the ocean, tennis courts, and golf course positioned in front 
        of me. Suddenly, the petty juvenile concerns of middle school-popularity, 
        fashions, superficial romances-were halted in a Schopenhauerian &quot;suspension 
        of the will&quot; as I absorbed the playful potentials before me. I recognized 
        the imminent arrival of summer and the possibility of spending an entire 
        morning on a tennis court where, thanks to a phenomenal instructor, I 
        would learn about politics, sportsmanship, personal relationships, and 
        the value of humor in unique and meaningful ways.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Like the small moments in Noonan's life, these joyful memories define 
        my life. Though I certainly have ambitious aspirations for myself after 
        Bowdoin, I also cannot imagine a life that does not include summers in 
        Maine-both in reprisal of these experiences in adult form, or, if I ever 
        have children of my own, letting them experience these moments for themselves.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Noonan attributes much of her own longing for the everyday pleasures 
        and Hughes's desire to return to her family to September 11. Indeed, that 
        day engraved the ethereal nature of life in our collective conscience. 
        Though we have thankfully returned to a mostly normal life, I hope that 
        we never lose the recognition of mortality that we gained on that day. 
        Humbly understanding our diminutive stature in the universe allows us 
        to separate ourselves from materialistic obsessions and return to the 
        redeeming value of God, family, and country.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As someone who is beginning a summer of potentially life-affirming or 
        life-altering internships, and also witnessing the last class to depart 
        Bowdoin before I go myself, it is my hope for the class that we recognize 
        life and do not sacrifice it. For life-the recognition and appreciation 
        of transcendentally significant events and activities-helps sustain our 
        spirit and establishes a loving legacy.</p>
