        <font size="2">JEFF BENSON, M.D.</font><font size="2"></font></font></p>
      <p align="left">Dear Students:</p>
      <p align="left">I've written each week about a variety of health problems 
        and concerns. Most of what I've written has aimed to inform and advise 
        you as individuals, making your own choices and seeking your own well-being. 
        Some has touched on our need to look out for each other, to help support 
        each other, as members of a common community. The health benefits of community 
        building, however, may far exceed this kind of one-on-one support.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Social scientists have long known that social cohesion is 
        a critical determinant of public health. Emile Durkheim, for instance, 
        compared suicide statistics in European countries over time, and concluded 
        that the lowest rates of suicide consistently occurred in societies exhibiting 
        the highest degrees of social integration. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">More recently, case studies like Stewart Wolf's of the small 
        town of Roseto, PA, have shown that social cohesion can have a remarkable 
        effect on a variety of public health outcomes. Wolf found that until the 
        early 1960s, the Rosetans smoked as much as their neighbors, were just 
        as overweight and sedentary, consumed the same high-fat diets, but had 
        a 50 percent lower mortality rate from heart disease. The only features 
        that seemed to distinguish Roseto from neighboring towns were unusually 
        close family ties and cohesive community relationships. Roseto had more 
        than 2 1/2 times the number of civic associations per capita than its 
        neighbors, and most of them were locally-based, not branches of national 
        groups. By the mid-1960s, however, people began to look outside of Roseto 
        for work, and community group memberships began to decline. Older community 
        ways were gradually replaced by more modern behaviors. Most interesting, 
        homes in Roseto, which had always been built with porches facing the street, 
        were now built with porches at the back, overlooking private yards. By 
        the 1980's, Roseto's heart attack rate was exactly the same as its neighbors.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Public health researchers like Ichiro Kawachi study the 
        relationship between &quot;social capital&quot; and individual health. 
        Social capital consists of those features of social organization which 
        bring people together for mutual benefit. It includes everything from 
        a community's density of associational memberships, to levels of interpersonal 
        trust and norms of reciprocity. </p>
      <p align="left">Kawachi has found that variations in these indicators of 
        social capital correlate strongly with mortality rates. In fact, a 10 
        percent increase in a community's sense of mutual trust is associated 
        with a 9 percent lower level of overall mortality! <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Many of us here at Bowdoin are seeking to build a stronger 
        sense of community, to find ways to reach out to each other, to understand 
        and support each other. The more respect and concern we show one another, 
        and the more we are able to build a sense of trust and social obligation 
        amongst ourselves, then the greater will be our community's social capital 
        as well as our own individual well-being. There is much to learn, much 
        to be done, and much to gain, here, under the Pines.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Good luck to you all with papers and exams!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Take good care of yourselves. Have wonderful summers. And 
        see you in the Fall! </p>
