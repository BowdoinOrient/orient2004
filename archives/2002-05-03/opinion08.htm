        <font size="2">PATRICK ROCKEFELLER</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having written a fair bit this year for both the Orient 
        and The Patriot, I have received responses from a number of people. Often 
        attempting to be conciliatory after roundly abusing my arguments, they 
        conclude their correspondence by saying something like, &quot;There are 
        some good arguments to be made for conservatism, but these aren't them.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Usually, conservative arguments aren't seen as the &quot;right&quot; 
        ones because of a split in thought. That said, we venture into the daunting 
        world of political theory.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I've found there to be two general motivating forces in 
        the conservative movement. These are anti-state, and anti-left, and some 
        people cling more to one than the other.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Those that take up the anti-state cause first and foremost 
        are often called libertarians. These are people who think that the government 
        that governs least governs best-minimal taxes and government spending, 
        etc. These are the &quot;economic conservatives,&quot; who also tend to 
        follow the &quot;socially liberal&quot; path, reasonably arguing that 
        the government has no right to legislate things like abortion or gun control, 
        and should support school choice, etc.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Anti-state was the original conservatism, as cultural conservatives 
        often saw the best protection in a weak state. However, with the advent 
        of a progressive left, especially with the rise of the USSR and international 
        communism in the middle of the 20th century, there arose a strong anti-left 
        conservatism. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The anti-left folks are by no means pro-state, but recognize 
        the benefits derived from some authority. Historically, these are the 
        people that came to America seeking freedom to worship and live in the 
        manner they desired. They did not necessarily proscribe to the individualist, 
        libertarian mold of freedom, but instead the freedom to do as they wished 
        within the community.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In modern times, the anti-left movement has taken many forms, 
        from the religious right to the anti-PC crusaders.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The key to a strong conservative movement in the future 
        will be its ability to incorporate both the anti-state and anti-left movements 
        under the same &quot;big tent.&quot; However, too often people choose 
        political affliation and elected officials based on one issue. An example 
        of this would be a person who felt that abortion was an important right 
        to keep legal (Democratic platform), but that cutting taxes was important 
        for economic growth and job development (Republican platform).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Now, the initial tendency in an effort to create a GOP that 
        truly pulled people under the &quot;big tent&quot; might be to move towards 
        the middle. However, Bill Clinton and his &quot;New Democrats&quot; tried 
        this. The resulting move towards the political center created a splintering 
        of the far left and accusations that the two parties had become too similar. 
        This gave the likes of Ralph Nader a niche, which many have argued cost 
        Gore the election.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Charles Kessler, a conservative political theorist, argued 
        that conservatives in the 1980's failed to take the moral high ground 
        and therefore lost the chance to secure a true conservative Republican 
        party. Reagan generally shifted the political equilibrium to the right, 
        but he didn't secure the GOP's future.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">When he cut taxes, the bill gained enough votes to pass 
        based on its sound financial sense. This was all right and good, but Kessler 
        argued that Reagan should have focused on the idea that it is immoral 
        to tax some people at such a higher rate than others.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Kessler's argument has a lot of merit, but possesses shortcomings 
        as well. It could destroy the conservative movement in the short run by 
        ending the coalition between anti-left and anti-state. The stronger argument 
        for conservatives to make is ensuring that both points are heard, thus 
        encouraging more people to support the cause.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, to claim that one is not making the &quot;right arguments&quot; 
        to support a conservative case is ultimately a matter of opinion. Does 
        one support the anti-state position or the anti-left? Both sides make 
        good arguments, and in the end, the best way to create a Republican party 
        that gets the most people into the &quot;big tent&quot;-without abandoning 
        its basic beliefs-is to make sure both anti-state and anti-left arguments 
        are made.</p>
