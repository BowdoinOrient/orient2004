        <font size="2">GENEVIVE CREEDON</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I was four months old when I moved to the United States. 
        My first words were in French, to my mother's delight and my father's 
        horror. The tables turned, though, several times, until my family landed 
        in a town that was home to a French American school, a town where the 
        compromise of national identity was to be found. </p>
      <p align="left">People I encounter never fail to remark how wonderful it 
        is that I am fluent in two languages and have studied two others to varying 
        degrees. The &quot;I wish I could have done that&quot; comments perpetuate, 
        and while I see the great advantages of being schooled in a bilingual 
        and bicultural system, there are conflicts that arise as well.</p>
      <p align="left">In the school I attended for the better part of my education, 
        the French staff members almost always had an issue with the English side, 
        to say nothing of the Spanish, German and Latin components. Students were 
        rarely aware of the tensions. The school always wanted to believe the 
        utopian vision that a bicultural system really gives a student the best 
        of all worlds. </p>
      <p align="left">I would agree in most cases, except perhaps in the realm 
        of cultural identity. At the school, the few of us who were permanent 
        residents or had been in the U.S. for more than six years were considered 
        to be the Americans. We were the stabilizers of the school, unlikely to 
        be sent with our families to Taiwan on two weeks' notice. The French teachers 
        playfully referred to us as the &quot;Anglophones.&quot; We were distinct.</p>
      <p align="left">Outside that environment, in soccer leagues and even at 
        the local public high school, I was known as the kid who came from the 
        French school. Quite suddenly, I was no longer American. I was thrown 
        instead into the &quot;say something in French&quot; world that drove 
        me crazy. </p>
      <p align="left">For one, I have never considered myself to be French. If 
        anything, I am a French Canadian, except that when I go to Canada people 
        wonder how my mother, who speaks with a good Canadian accent, can have 
        a daughter who is so &quot;French.&quot; In fact, I'm not a particular 
        fan of the Canadian accent, and I don't spend much time in Canada, maybe 
        a month out of the year for skiing. </p>
      <p align="left">The result of an &quot;international community&quot; is, 
        for immigrants, often a stronger sense of culture and cultural identity. 
        I don't consider myself to be an immigrant, but at the same time, Americans 
        won't call me American. When they learn that I speak French, they suddenly 
        detect a slight accent that I can only hope is imagined. </p>
      <p align="left">It becomes of paramount importance to find a place where 
        one's culture or cultures are not continually linked to actions and words. 
        Part of an education certainly is learning that in some contexts a person 
        does not want to be inextricably linked to his or her heritage. Ask me 
        what I am, and I'm inclined to just call myself a mutt at this point. 
        For me, the designation works. For others, it may not. </p>
      <p align="left">In response to my non-committal attitude toward cultural 
        or national identity, I have often been told that it can &quot;be a problem,&quot; 
        and that I have to decide on my national allegiance sooner or later. I 
        suppose it can be a problem if it leads to rootlessness, but can we not 
        find roots that are not planted in such subjective entities as nation 
        and history?</p>
