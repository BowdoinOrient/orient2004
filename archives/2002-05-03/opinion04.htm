        <font size="2">SARAH RAMEY</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A girl sits in the library, wiping her cold-ridden nose 
        with her last Kleenex, and tosses it in the garbage. Then, with a rising 
        feeling of dread, she senses a huge one coming on&#133;she gauges the 
        distance between her and the bathroom&#133;it's too far, even if she sprints. 
        She eyes the heap of Kleenex in the trash can&#133;no, she can't re-use, 
        that's too disgusting&#133;oh, but here it comes&#133;her eyes start to 
        close, her eyebrows go up-it's going to be a huge one-and&#133;ACHOOOOO!!!!!<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A few heads turn in the library and see her cradling her 
        face, presumably still recovering from the impact&#133;but behind her 
        hands the girl sits, stunned, at a complete loss for what to do with the 
        enormous snot bubble that has escaped and is not attached to the outside 
        of her nose. Oh, the shame.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In the weight room, a man kneels next to the mirror, intent 
        on his rippling biceps, exhaling dramatically through pursed lips, instructing 
        himself intermittently to &quot;Do it, Chad&#133;do it.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Somewhere on campus, one girl bites it big time, tripping 
        over her own feet, letting out an inhuman howl, hitting the ground so 
        hard that she actually rips her jeans, drawing blood from her own knee. 
        She looks quickly around to see if anyone has seen. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Emerging from the game room, a student checks to make sure 
        no one has seen him play pinball for two straight hours. However, despite 
        his guilt, he is the new high scorer for Mars Attacks, and in his step 
        is new found bounce.<br>
        Early in the morning, a girl is motivated to get out of bed solely to 
        check her email, only to find a lonely Student Digest staring her in the 
        face.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A boy is cruising down College Street in his Jeep when a 
        familiar pop song comes on. He starts to sing along, when suddenly he 
        realizes that it is no Britney Spears, or even N'Sync&#133;rather&#133;Ace 
        of Base. He looks left, looks right, reaches for the dial&#133;and cranks 
        it. &quot;All that she wants, is another baby! She's gone tomorrow boy!&quot; 
        he sings with conviction as he takes off down Maine Street.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A boy stands in front of his mirror retracting his chin 
        to see just how many chins he can create. Too many, he concludes, and 
        turns sadly away.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Here he comes,&quot; she thinks nervously as the The 
        Boy walks towards her. She racks her brain for something, anything, to 
        say, distracted by her fluttering heart and clammy hands. Finally they 
        meet, and thankfully He initiates the hello with &quot;Hey, how are you?&quot; 
        to which she replies immediately &quot;Oh, nothing.&quot; Pause. Blink. 
        Appalled with herself, she looks down and walks away.</p>
      <p align="center">/ | \</p>
      <p>Lameness. It's everywhere, it's in everyone, and you can't escape. Try&#133;oh, 
        you can try, but I'm sorry, I'm sticking to my guns on this one&#133;no 
        one can outrun the embarrassing clutches of Uncoolness.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The problem is that this deceptive concept of Being Cool has created 
        deep divides within the student body. The Too Cool kids strut unwarranted 
        around the dining hall. The Not Cool kids in response develop an equally 
        repulsive complex, acting aloof and drawing attention to their intellect 
        at every given chance. Then there are the In Betweeners, who are not cool, 
        but seem to know and even embrace it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In my room, we know we're not cool. Sometimes we IM each other despite 
        being four feet away, and basically we sit around and quote Zoolander 
        whenever appropriate (nay&#133;whenever). The number of people I have 
        informed quite earnestly that &quot;I can Derelick my own balls, thank 
        you,&quot; is frankly embarrassing.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Also, to use myself as another example (as if all of the above examples 
        were not taken directly from my own life)&#133;I have sat, quite seriously 
        in front of my television, reach-reach-reaching to the sky, nodding reverently 
        as my Pilates instructor informs me that my spine is my center, and that 
        I should &quot;keep it supple, keep it safe, keep it strong.&quot; Cool? 
        No, I don't think so.<br>
        But here is my point&#133;am I the only dork on campus? (To those who 
        find themselves to be oh so witty and reply 'yes' here&#133;that's very 
        very hilariously side-splittingly funny.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>Anyways, the answer is no. For example: the captain of the women's lacrosse 
        team wears a mouthguard. And when she takes it out, thick, slimy ropes 
        of drool stretch from her mouth and fall with a sticky slap against her 
        chin. Cool? No.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Take any social house event&#133;haggard girls stumbling, husky voiced, 
        mascara streaked&#133;percent coolness? No percent. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Or, on the other end of the spectrum, there are a few music nerds who 
        I am certain have never, ever left the music library. Day in, day out, 
        they peer skeptically at me from in between enormous headphones, perceiving 
        correctly with their hyperintelligent brains that I can't read music, 
        implying always through narrowed eyes that I am and will always be inferior. 
        I won't even pose the coolness question here.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So, the point is, everyone is more or less lamer than you think, and 
        perhaps a little more honesty about this subject could mend the gaps that 
        have gone unbridged thus far.<br>
      </p>
      <p>And what I really want to say is&#133;unite, Bowdoin! I urge you, comrades&#133;Let 
        us pick our wedgies, wear our headgear, and let out the occasional snort 
        together, not in the lonely confines of our dorm rooms! Do not succumb 
        to the illusion of false boundaries when the truth is we have all seen 
        more episodes of Full House than we would care to admit. And don't tell 
        me you didn't look forward to Steve Urkel's sexy transformation into&#133;Stefan.</p>
      <p>And now I've said too much.</p>
