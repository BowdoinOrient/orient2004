      <p align="left">Parking statistics released by security last month reveal 
        that parking violations on Bowdoin's campus are down by 5.5 percent compared 
        to last year's numbers. The total number of tickets and warnings issued 
        by security during the period beginning September 1, 2001 and ending April 
        8, 2002 is 1,983; down from the 2,099 violations tallied the previous 
        academic year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The total expense paid by parking violators for their offenses 
        also declined this year. Last year, parking violators, most of whom are 
        students, paid $24,290 in tickets and towing expenses. This year violators 
        spend $20,150, down 17 percent from last year. The $25 ticket fee remained 
        consistent across the two years, as did the increased fine for parking 
        in handicapped spaces and towing a vehicle.<br>

            parking lot last year. This year, parking violations on the Bowdoin

      <p align="left">Security's parking enforcement officer Dick Yanok does not 
        know the exact reason for the decrease in violations. He has noticed, 
        however, that, &quot;Students are paying closer attention to offenses 
        in accounts and are calling up this office for warnings and individual 
        tickets.&quot; He is aware of an overall improvement in students' parking 
        behavior this year compared to past years.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Reports indicate that problem areas on campus witnessing 
        high incidences of violations remain fairly constant from last year. The 
        greatest number of violations for both years is reported in descending 
        order as South Campus Drive, the Admissions lot, and North Campus Drive. 
        This year one third of all violations occurred in these three lots of 
        the 55 total lots on campus. This year, Ladd House parking came in fourth 
        in most total violations, up from number five last year. Though Ladd garnered 
        a greater percentage of violations this year, its actual number of violations 
        was down by 7 from last year when it was still referred to as Chi Delta 
        House or 14 College Street. </p>
      <p align="left">Rounding out the top eight locations with the most violations 
        this year are Brunswick Apartments, Druckenmiller, Chamberlain south side, 
        and the Coffin Street lots.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yanok points to director of security Bruce Boucher's dedication 
        to not overbook any lots when giving out permits as the reason behind 
        the decrease in the number of violations in these problem locations. Yanok 
        explains that, &quot;In past years the Coffin Street lot was overbooked 
        by 20% under the assumption that not all of the registered vehicles would 
        be parked in the lot at the same time.&quot; Yanok claims that Boucher's 
        change in policy has played a large role in the decrease of overall violations.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Despite an overall greater compliance by students as far 
        as on campus parking goes, Yanok still asserts that a group of &quot;hardcore 
        parking violators&quot; still remains. Nevertheless, Yanok added that 
        this group has greatly diminished in size. Last year, there were 59 students 
        by late April who had at least three outstanding tickets. These scofflaws, 
        as they are referred to by security, owed a total of $5,900 to the College.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Yanok applauds this trend of greater compliance and hopes 
        that it will continue. He also reminds students to not park beneath the 
        famed Bowdoin pines especially as spring is upon us and the ground thaws. 
        &quot;Parking beneath the pines compacts the soil, which starves roots 
        of water and oxygen and kills the trees,&quot; Yanok explains. This year 
        eight dead and dying trees have been extracted along College Street as 
        a result of parked cars starving the trees of nourishment.</p>
