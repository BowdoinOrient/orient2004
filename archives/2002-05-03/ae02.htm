        <font size="2">JIM FLANAGAN<br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This article is the last regular contribution that I will 
        be making to the Orient. It makes me really happy to be able to use my 
        last appearance in print to tell you all about Brad Anderson's return 
        to Bowdoin. Anderson graduated from Bowdoin in 1987 and since then has 
        written and directed four feature films. Two years ago, Anderson made 
        his first return to Bowdoin when he brought his recently completed <i>Happy 
        Accidents</i>. This time, Anderson is coming to share with us his newest 
        creation, <i>Session 9</i>. Accompanying him is fellow Bowdoin alum Steve 
        Gevedon '88, who co-wrote the film with Anderson and stars in it. Anderson 
        and Gevedon will be on hand at our showing of their film, and will answer 
        any questions afterwards. Saturday, Anderson and Gevedon will present 
        a workshop in Smith Auditorium from 11:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. The workshop 
        is open to everyone, but the screening of Session 9 requires a Bowdoin 
        ID (and a suggested donation to Habitat for Humanity).</p>
      <p><i>Session 9</i><br>
        Friday at 8:30 p.m. at the Eveningstar Cinema<br>
        So far, Anderson has made three lovely romantic comedies. This film brings 
        him into a new genre: horror. Going against the current slasher flick 
        trends, this film harkens back to The Shining or Don't Look Now. Anderson 
        describes it as &quot;a horror movie in the traditional sense of horror 
        as dread and menace, as opposed to shock and cheap thrills, like gore. 
        We wanted the story to grow on you, the creepiness to grow on you like 
        mold!&quot; Filmed at the abandoned Danvers State Insane Asylum, the film 
        concerns five men who are desperate for work, and agree to remove all 
        the asbestos from the old Asylum. As they work, they learn about the horrid 
        events that occurred within the walls: abuse, torture, and even possessions.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This film was shot with Sony's new 24P Hi-Definition camera. This is 
        the same camera used to film Star Wars Episode II. But while Star Wars 
        won't be released for a few more weeks, <i>Session 9</i> is on the market, 
        making it the first officially released film to use this camera. Besides 
        Gevedon, the film also features David Caruso, Brendon Sexton III, Peter 
        Mullan, and Josh Lucas.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Following the film, Anderson and Gevedon will answer any questions the 
        audience has on their film. But don't limit your questions to <i>Session 
        9</i>! Over the past two weeks, Brad's earlier films have been shown so 
        that we could all be familiar with his work. Brad wants to address any 
        questions you have about these films, or anything else you think he or 
        Steve could answer.<br>
        This event requires a Bowdoin ID to get in. Also, the Eveningstar has 
        limited seating. We were forced to turn people away from Anderson's last 
        visit. Don't get left out! Finally, all attending will be asked to donate 
        a small amount of money to support Bowdoin's Habitat for Humanity effort.</p>
      <p><i>Session 9</i><br>
        <i>The Making of an Independent Film</i> <br>
        Saturday at 11:30 p.m. in Smith Auditorium<br>
        This will be an open discussion/workshop on how Anderson and Gevedon took 
        their idea for a small film shot on DV cameras and made it into an innovation, 
        studio-backed production. In Anderson's own words: &quot;[We'll] basically 
        talk about the development of the project-writing script, getting financing, 
        casting, shooting, editing, the distribution of the film etc&#133;. Steve 
        would talk about it as an actor and me as writer/director/editor. I would 
        show videos about the making of the film, rough cuts of scenes, the trailers, 
        we could give people handouts if interested. We could also talk about 
        our other movies and other experiences-lots of stories to tell. It would 
        be fun. It would really be for anyone interested in movies but especially 
        for students thinking about getting into the business.&quot; But even 
        if you aren't thinking about a filmmaking career after Bowdoin, this event 
        will show you how films are made, and how a liberal arts education can 
        lead to great success.</p>
