      <p align="left"><font size="5">Delaying tactics</font></p>
      <p>There's a crucial vote next Monday, and Student Government wants you 
        to know about it. Professors and coaches are scheduled to vote on a motion 
        to exempt the current student body from a plus/minus grading system with 
        which the Faculty has already decided to saddle future classes. The coming 
        Faculty meeting has been met by a rare blitz of publicity and maneuvering 
        by Student Government, which thinks-rightly so-that students are unhappy 
        with the impending change.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Students found notices in their mailboxes this week that read, &quot;Make 
        your voice heard. On May 6, the Faculty has the opportunity to grandfather 
        the existing student body from the new grading policy. This message brought 
        to you by: Student Government.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p>We're not used to such strong language (everything is relative) from 
        our student representatives, but the initiative is very welcome. There's 
        no doubt that the issue is front and center in most students' minds. It's 
        obviously a priority for our representatives too.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The strategically-minded student reps decided to avoid a fight over plus/minus 
        itself next week; instead, they hope that the contract that current students 
        have with Bowdoin is not tampered with unfairly. The faculty ought to 
        respect student opinion on Monday and also go further by delaying the 
        grading change to the fall of 2003. The incoming first-year class knowingly 
        applied to a school that had kept its head about grading. Will the Faculty 
        disappoint them-and us? <i>-JMF</i></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="5"><a name="2"></a>Committee needs to act objectively</font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">With the recent addition of plus and minus grades and the 
        possibility of adding GPAs to transcripts, it is possible that, in the 
        span of one year, two of Bowdoin's long-held academic policies could be 
        overturned, and Bowdoin College could become a very different place as 
        a result.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">However, the fact that the Faculty could essentially wipe 
        out several decades worth of academic policy is not surprising, since 
        many faculty members do not understand Bowdoin's academic tradition. Nor 
        are they likely to gain any insights into why the College currently prohibits 
        the calculation of GPA if their only source of information comes from 
        a memo that the Recording Committee recently sent to faculty members regarding 
        its recommendation to calculate GPA.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Nowhere in the memo did the Committee state that one of 
        the reasons that GPAs are not currently calculated is because the College 
        has historically de-emphasized grades, which is evidenced by the various 
        grading systems that the College has used, including one system in which 
        letter grades were not used at all. By not providing historical information, 
        faculty members are more likely to vote for measures that they think would 
        be good for any general college, instead of what would be good for Bowdoin.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">What is perhaps even worse, though, is that the Recording 
        Committee neglected to mention any of the negative consequences that might 
        arise, such as an increased emphasis on grades, if the prohibition against 
        calculating and reporting GPAs was removed. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even if this was a simple oversight on the part of the Committee, 
        the memo undoubtedly indicates a certain degree of bias on the Committee. 
        Because it is the Recording Committee that decides which grading policies 
        need revision, having such a bias can be a very dangerous thing, especially 
        when one considers that only about one half of the faculty members actually 
        attend faculty meetings and cast votes. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The bias of the Recording Committee combined with the absence 
        of half of the Faculty at faculty meeting votes makes for a very questionable 
        method of producing academic policy. It makes sense to have a group such 
        as the Recording Committee bring up questions of academic policy, but 
        the group should act in an objective way and should be respectful of Bowdoin's 
        traditional policies. <i>-BJL</i></p>
