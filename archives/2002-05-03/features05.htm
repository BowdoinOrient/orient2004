      <p align="left"><font size="5">A burnt-out hippie<br>
        <font size="2">LUDWIG RANG</font><font size="2"><br>
        ALUMNUS WRITER</font></font><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Going back to England in '69 meant my life had come full 
        circle. In-between leaving school in spring '54 and starting college at 
        Bowdoin in the fall, as readers of my first Orient series may remember, 
        I had spent the summer in London. Here I met Rosemary and Nigel, already 
        engaged, and soon after to be married. A few years later they asked me 
        to be godfather to one of their children, a pretty girl called Penelope, 
        or Penny for short. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Eleven now, Penny had an older sister, plus three younger 
        brothers, all of whom except the youngest I'd met when, after getting 
        an overseas discharge from the army, taking my German girlfriend Helga 
        to Cornwall in summer '63.I hadn't seen the family since. Now quite unexpectedly 
        it was to provide a safe haven for a burnt-out hippie case. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Writing to me in the &quot;winter of my discontent&quot; 
        in New York, Rose had told me I'd be welcome to stay with them as long 
        as I wished. Penny was dying to see her absentee godfather again. What 
        I didn't realize at first was that this generous invitation was in part 
        prompted by the fact that after fifteen years and five children my friends' 
        marriage was more or less on the rocks. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Taking me aside soon after my arrival for a confidential 
        chat Nigel admitted as much. Always an ambivalent type, he had fallen 
        in love it seemed, if only platonically, with one of the apprentices at 
        the firm whose training program he ran. Leaving Rose to look after the 
        children he'd go off for the weekend hiking and camping with the lads, 
        including young Robert who could have been his son. Rose didn't mind, 
        Nigel said, because she was no longer interested in sexual relations with 
        him herself. He was, in effect, giving me carte blanche as far as my own 
        relations with her were concerned. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Having had a youthful crush on Rose, five or six years older 
        than me, my feelings for her hadn't really changed, though they had reached 
        a different stage. Just over forty now, but still attractive, and with 
        undiminished sexual desire, she was just the woman I needed. I was put 
        up in the guest room, and the children-before getting dressed and going 
        off to school-would come rushing in to horse around while I had breakfast 
        in bed, a special treat for a guest they treated like an older brother. 
        When they were gone, dropped off by Nigel on his way to work, Rose would 
        come up to collect the breakfast tray and, not yet dressed either, slip 
        into bed with me. Acquainted with my past sexual history, she may not 
        have expected what happened next, though was pleasantly surprised, she 
        afterwards told me. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">It was thus that within days of my arrival a true love-child 
        was conceived. Naturally there was great excitement when the children 
        were told Mummy was pregnant again. Nigel for his part took it all in 
        good stride, glad to be able to go off with his young friend. Obviously 
        the baby wasn't planned, but Rose adamantly refused even to contemplate 
        a termination. A boy was born on New Year's Day, 1970. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Since we both liked the legend of King Arthur we decided 
        to name him Mark. With a part?time job teaching German at a local college 
        I was able to contribute to household expenses. My longer-term aim was 
        to write, particularly about my experiences as a Hippie in America, including 
        what I still believed had been &quot;surveillance&quot; by the FBI. Remembering 
        a young barrister I'd shared digs with in London in '54, now a Member 
        of Parliament (and eventually Solicitor General under Callaghan), I made 
        an appointment and went up to London to see him. Over drinks in the bar 
        of the House of Commons I told Peter Archer my story. Much of it sounded 
        quite plausible he thought. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The FBI after all was known to have kept tabs on thousands 
        of anti?war activists, and would have been particularly interested in 
        one who at the height of the cold war had spent six months in West Berlin, 
        making frequent trips into the eastern part of the divided city. My file 
        with the Bureau, perhaps even passed on to M16, probably was as thick 
        as the New York telephone book, Peter laughed. We left it at that.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">A more important question facing me was whether to stay 
        in Cornwall or not. There being no question that Rosemary and Nigel would 
        stay together, if only for the sake of the children, including number 
        six, I decided to go back to Germany. It wasn't an easy decision. But 
        best for all concerned everyone was agreed, except of course Rose. For 
        her it was heart-breaking. But at least she had the love-child. Brought 
        up with his English family Mark never was told who his real father was. 
        Fortunately he had an excellent relationship with the man he called daddy. 
        Married last year, he may make me (an unacknowledged) grandfather soon. 
        For me this was the end of gay life. It was a phase of my life that I'm 
        not ashamed of and look back on with pleasure. Basically, like most people, 
        I'm neither exclusively heterosexual nor homosexual, but just sexual. 
        I'd like to conclude this second Orient series with an apt quote from 
        the philosopher Schopenhauer. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The first forty years of one's life, he said, are the text, 
        the rest is commentary. I've been at work on the latter, off and on, for 
        quite a few years now. Some day soon I hope to complete and present it 
        in book form. <br>
      </p>
