        <font size="2">CRAIG GIAMMONA</font><font size="2"><br>
        COLUMNIST</font></font></p>
      <p align="left"> As the hour of my graduation from Bowdoin College nears, 
        I have begun a period of deep contemplation, the culmination of which 
        will be a series of aphoristic, universally applicable truths and reflections 
        based on my time in Brunswick as Bowdoin student. </p>
      <p align="left">For many weeks I have felt the undeniable urge to express 
        myself in an unadulterated and honest way, but it wasn't until recently 
        that I realized how this was possible. The tentative title of my book: 
        <i>Nietszchean Ruminations Just North of Boston: One Man's Struggle to 
        Exist and Strive Among Herd Animals. </i><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">This will be a revolutionary project. The plan is to write 
        Nietzschean aphorisms, followed by what I like to call &quot;Herd Animal 
        Commentary.&quot; After I express my views in a comprehensive and radical 
        honest form, I will interpret my own writing in a way that common men 
        will be able to understand. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Even though the project is still in its infant stage, I 
        have managed to convince my extremely secretive publisher to allow a short 
        excerpt to be printed in this week's <i>Orient</i>.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Mythology of the first punch: Oh, you Nihilists! Stop whining, 
        your shrill voices offend my ears, for they are sensitive to the incoherence 
        with which man speaks. You whine like a baby desperate for gratification 
        and motherly reassurance, and shiver at the thought of life; a baby who 
        has soiled himself for lack of control of his physiology. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">I respond, not to the content of your ceaseless statements, 
        but to the sheer cacophony which defines that which leaves you. It is 
        a wonder he continues to do so, when it is clear from my nauseated countenance 
        that I am uninterested and actively disgusted by your shallow personage, 
        and even more so by its short linguistic offering which brings with it 
        no semblance of importance or intelligibility. Have you not realized the 
        shackles thrust upon you by our &quot;modern&quot; civilizations? Our 
        mediocre collywaddling, yellow chicken-livered asceticism has made mythology 
        of the inevitable inertia which leads those who are herd animals, or other 
        such downtrodden obnoxious beasts, to become involved in physical discourse. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But this moral offense must be followed by a moral reaction 
        that precludes you from physicality. If it is moral, it is universal and 
        therefore cannot be manifested physically. This makes one sick, especially 
        those contained in the herd, lacking the definition of character and spirit 
        to have a transcendent understanding. They lack the fluidity to being 
        for an appropriate digestion, and shiver from confrontation. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But it is far nobler, far healthier, for man to keep his 
        offense inside the world of the comprehensively physical. If his will 
        to power is his inherentness then he must seek his enemy and seek to annihilate 
        that enemy if his views are found to be wrong or dishonestly created. 
        If this is so, if he lacks the ability for a paradoxical understanding 
        which laughs ironically at life's riddle, then he is lost and must keep 
        away from others to whom his only affect is to prune away that which is 
        most life-affirming.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Herd Animal Commentary: It is interesting to me how pervasive 
        the &quot;no first punch&quot; ethic is. But I'm not crazy. I realize 
        with all of my rational faculties that fighting is silly and should be 
        avoided. If someone bumps and spills beer on me, I just smile, think to 
        myself &quot;What would Nietzsche do?&quot; and walk on. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">That could be because I am a slight man who would lose many 
        physical battles. But I am natural, and this is good. Civilization has 
        allowed man to separate himself from the beastly ancestors who operated 
        on a code of kill or be killed, and the healthy have benefited from this.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">But then again, aren't there some times when fights should 
        happen? Maybe it's all the Nietzsche or horrible graduation anxiety, but 
        sometimes I think a good old fashioned first punch is necessary. There 
        are people who are mistaken about their own powers and need to be directed 
        toward the right path. These individuals must be taught certain fundamental 
        life lessons which they are incapable of grasping otherwise. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Maybe, but maybe not. I certainly don't want to fight. Talking 
        about fighting is boring, so if there won't be fighting, there shouldn't 
        be talk of it. People who want to talk about fighting should do it among 
        themselves, so that those who do not want to talk about fighting don't 
        have to be offended by the irrational verbal offerings of those who do.</p>
