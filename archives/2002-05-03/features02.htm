      <p align="left">The importance of campus security has been magnified by 
        the recent violent attacks on Bates, in which one student was murdered 
        and another sexually assaulted. While popular student sentiment may resent 
        its role in monitoring parties and enforcing parking regulations, a closer 
        look at Bowdoin Security's operations suggests that it is more of a resource 
        than some may realize.<br>

      <p align="left">There are a total of 14 security personnel here at Bowdoin. 
        Director Bruce Boucher heads two assistant directors and eleven regular 
        officers, which are alternately assigned to communications and patrol. 
        The high number of personnel is due largely to the fact that security 
        is a round-the-clock operation that functions all 365 days of the year.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">As part of my inside look at Bowdoin Security, I had the 
        opportunity to ride along with Officer Margery Logan for a portion of 
        her patrol this past Saturday night. It was not just any Saturday night, 
        mind you, but the second (or third or fourth, depending on your habits) 
        big night of Ivies Weekend. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">My night begins in the Communications Center at Rhodes Hall. 
        There, a security officer monitors video screens, campus alarm systems, 
        and answers phone calls. Tucked away in one corner is a computer that 
        is constantly updated, showing all entries to doors around campus that 
        require your I.D. card. Recorded is the time and place of entry as well 
        as the name and I.D. number of the card used to enter.<br>

              day); 444 Security Checks after a door was found unlocked, ajar,

      <p align="left">After she files a report on a fire alarm at Hubbard earlier 
        in the day, Officer Logan and I head out in Security's ubiquitous white 
        Jeep. It is charged with a strong smell of beer-that of an unregistered 
        keg, I learn. From then it's on to patrol the campus&#133;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9:08 We check the registered kegs at Pinestock. The crowd 
        is still very light. Officer Logan comments that the Pine St. Apartments 
        are one of the better places to hold events as the back just opens out 
        onto trees and the road.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9:19 Lock up at the Farley Tennis Courts. The Jeep's scanner 
        is alive with chatter by Brunswick Police officers.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9:26 Someone has propped open one of the back doors to Chamberlain. 
        Don't prop doors open, because if you do, security will close them.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9:35 Another check of Pine St.. The crowd is growing, and 
        students' cars line the street.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">9:54 While at the Stowe Inn, several students ask Officer 
        Logan for a ride. While rides from security officers used to be fairly 
        common, officers will now only give rides if the situations warrant.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:01 We stop back at the Communications Center to get the 
        keg numbers for a party in Coles Tower. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:11 Officer Logan and I are detoured from Coles Tower 
        to Pine Street, where a student has suffered a sprained ankle.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:24 We drop off the injured student at Parkview Hospital.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:26 We finally make it to Coles Tower, where we check 
        a small private party. Everything's &quot;10-4.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:37 We stop at a house on College Street for a lock out. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:44 Like swallows to Capistrano, students keep flocking 
        to Pinestock. So do Brunswick Police, who have a number of patrol cars 
        in the area.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">10:58 While monitoring Brunswick Police radio traffic, Officer 
        Logan learns of a student with an injured knee outside the cemetery on 
        Pine St.. Traveling down Harpswell Road, we turn around and head back 
        to Pinestock.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">11:34 Some students are starting to head back from Pinestock 
        and request rides. Again, they are reminded of their options-the escort 
        service and the Student Government Taxi service.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">11:46 Students leaving Pine St. are reminded to finish or 
        dump their beer before they leave.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">11:51 A lone, intoxicated female student is headed down 
        Bowker Street towards campus. Recognizing the potential for an unsafe 
        situation, Officer Logan offers her a ride to her residence, which she 
        accepts. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">While my experience lacked the high drama of a good episode 
        of COPS or Rescue-911 (granted, I'm no William Shatner), it was an eye-opener 
        as to the wide variety of calls Bowdoin Security handles. The call log 
        from January through this past week shows a very busy security team, whether 
        handling routine unlock requests, investigating a theft or fire alarm 
        activation, or helping a stranded motorist on campus. The list of calls 
        indicates an organization designed to help students feel safe, not punish 
        them for their every wrong turn.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In speaking with Assistant Director of Security Mike Brown, 
        it becomes clear that measures such as these-taken to ensure safety rather 
        than &quot;punish&quot; or &quot;get&quot; students-are at the core of 
        Security's mission. &quot;Our department strives to provide a safe and 
        secure environment that is responsive to the needs of the College community,&quot; 
        Brown states. &quot;This manifests itself in ways ranging from the offering 
        of a Rape Aggression Defense class for women, to the detention of a group 
        of individuals who are suspected of assaulting a student.&quot; Brown 
        names as one of the biggest challenges to his job the &quot;perception 
        that we are 'out to get' students in trouble.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">One of the things I noticed on my ride-along was the close 
        working relationship that Bowdoin Security has with the Brunswick Police 
        Department. As one incident during the ride-along proved, the monitoring 
        of Brunswick Police's radio traffic can give Security a heads-up on something 
        of which they hadn't yet learned. &quot;I believe that we have a mutually 
        beneficial, positive working relationship with the Brunswick Police Department,&quot; 
        Assistant Director Brown says. &quot;And while we have many of the same 
        goals, I believe that the tools and the resources available to each department 
        is what sets us apart.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So next time you see that white Jeep driving around campus, 
        remember that while social code and parking enforcement is an inevitable 
        part of their job description, Security is there to be helpful. And next 
        time you call them for a ride or to let you in your room, say a little 
        thank you. Says Officer Brown: &quot;There is not a single officer in 
        this Department who doesn't enjoy helping people.&quot;</p>
