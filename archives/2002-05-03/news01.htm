      </p>
      <p align="left">The College's admissions office has no plans to scrap the 
        early decision process after the University of North Carolina gained nationwide 
        attention by doing so last week. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">President Barry Mills said he backed the early decision 
        option because it attracted a diverse group of students who were eager 
        to come to Bowdoin. He also said that &quot;for any single college to 
        move away from early admission would not be workable.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Early admissions programs offer colleges and universities 
        the opportunity to fine-tune an incoming class's makeup. Students who 
        apply for early decision, known also as early admission, are bound to 
        accept a college's offer of enrollment if one is made. In the early decision 
        process, the admissions office is guaranteed a 100 percent yield. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin has had an early admissions process in place for 
        several decades. &quot;In its purest form,&quot; said Dean of Admissions 
        Jim Miller, early admissions brings &quot;students who have a very strong 
        interest in a particular institution to an institution which has a strong 
        interest in a student.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">In recent months, some players in higher education have 
        raised concerns about early admissions programs. Richard Levin, Yale's 
        president, pushed for Ivy League schools to remove the early decision 
        option from admissions packets in an interview last fall. It is UNC, however, 
        that is the first American university to cut off an existing early admission 
        program, a decision it announced last Friday. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Evidence that the program was hindering UNC's efforts to 
        diversify and lowering its academic standards prompted the change. The 
        university said that the process was attracting students with relatively 
        low GPAs and SAT scores. UNC also found that early admission students 
        were rarely minorities, and often well off. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin administrators said UNC's conclusions about the 
        effects of early decision programs did not seem to apply here. &quot;I 
        think it works to everybody's advantage,&quot; Mills said. &quot;We've 
        been able to use early decision to build on our goals of making Bowdoin 
        a more diverse place.&quot; Miller said that &quot;we get a fair number 
        of students of color in early decision.&quot; He said that the socioeconomic 
        pictures of early and regular admissions pools &quot;are not different.&quot;<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">High schools, meanwhile, have their own problems with early 
        admissions. Students who apply for early decision have slightly better 
        chances of being accepted than those who apply later. According to Eric 
        Monheim, college counselor at The Bullis School in Potomac, Maryland, 
        the temptation of any kind of statistical edge drives students to apply 
        for early decision as a way to beat the system. &quot;We have kids come 
        in and say, 'I'm applying early. I just don't know where yet,'&quot; he 
        said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">&quot;The message from colleges is pretty clear,&quot; Monheim 
        said. &quot;You have to apply early.&quot; He estimated that 45 percent 
        of Bullis seniors applied early decision this year. At nearby private 
        schools, he said, up to three-fourths of graduating classes do.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Bowdoin administrators downplayed the stress and strain 
        that early admissions might place on high school students scrambling to 
        get fat envelopes from selective colleges. &quot;I hope that students 
        who apply early here are doing so for the right reasons,&quot; Miller 
        said. &quot;That's something we need to research.&quot; Miller said that 
        the &quot;enormous pressure&quot; on juniors and seniors to apply early 
        may be an &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of the early decision process.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Jaime Brewster, an admissions officer at Colby, said that 
        the Waterville school has not considered changing its early decision policy. 
        &quot;We promote that students don't use early admission as a strategy 
        to get into college,&quot; Brewster said.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Officials here did open the door to a formal study of Bowdoin's 
        early decision process. &quot;We're definitely looking at it,&quot; Miller 
        said. &quot;It's a good idea for us to look at it from a Bowdoin perspective.&quot; 
        It was unclear, however, how Bowdoin's decision would be affected by the 
        decisions of schools with which it competes. Mills said that a unilateral 
        move by any college to drop early admissions would be &quot;unworkable&quot;. 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">Miller suggested, though, that &quot;there may be an antitrust 
        issue... as to whether schools can move in concert to eliminate early 
        decision.&quot; Miller said that he hasn't discussed the process with 
        admissions officers at Bates, Colby, or other schools. &quot;I think we 
        need to do what's best for us,&quot; he said.</p>
