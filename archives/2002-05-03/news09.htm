      <p align="left">An amendment to plus/minus grading, introduced in Monday's 
        faculty meeting, will be put to a vote by the Faculty later this month. 
        The Faculty will choose whether to exempt the classes of 2003, 2004, and 
        2005 from the plus/minus system, which, if un-amended, will take effect 
        next fall.</p>
      <p>At the same meeting, the Faculty voted to instruct the Office of Student 
        Records to calculate and place student GPAs on all copies of their official 
        transcripts, but not on semester grade reports. The change will occur 
        no later than the fall of 2002.</p>
      <p>History professor Sarah McMahon introduced the &quot;grandfathering&quot; 
        motion, as it is referred to by many students. Her motion was an amendment 
        to the system approved by the Faculty in April after several months of 
        debate. &quot;I'm doing this for the students who greeted us today,&quot; 
        she said. As faculty entered Daggett Lounge for the meeting, they walked 
        past posters filled with names of students who signed a petition against 
        the plus/minus change. </p>
      <p>Ryan Gillia '04 was next to one poster, wearing a small sticker that 
        read &quot;learning, not grades.&quot; &quot;I respect the professors, 
        even though I'm against plus/minus,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they know 
        things about the system we don't know. We just need a discussion.&quot;</p>
      <p>Jason Long '05, also standing outside Daggett, was more direct. &quot;We 
        do not want the system to affect us,&quot; he said. But he said he did 
        not expect the faculty to ultimately approve the exemption for current 
        Bowdoin classes. &quot;Students are disenfranchised,&quot; he said. &quot;We 
        don't matter.&quot;</p>
      <p>Faculty members are set to vote on McMahon's grandfathering proposal 
        on May 20, at the final faculty meeting of the academic year. </p>
      <p>The GPA issue appeared to be settled after the assembled professors passed 
        an amendment, introduced by Mathematics professor Sarah-Marie Belcastro, 
        that will keep grade point averages off the semesterly grade reports sent 
        home. The motion calls for the Office of Student Records to include the 
        GPA on the transcripts it sends to employers, schools, and students upon 
        request. </p>
      <p>An amendment that would have kept the GPA uncalculated by default, but 
        would allow students to opt-in to the GPA transcript, was defeated by 
        voice vote. That amendment was also introduced by McMahon.</p>
      <p>In other news from the Faculty meeting:</p>
      <p>- Dean of Admissions Jim Miller reported that, as of Monday afternoon, 
        129 students of color will matriculate next fall, more than 25 percent 
        of the incoming class and, by initial estimates, the highest percentage 
        ever for the College. The number of Asian and Hispanic students, he said, 
        approximately doubled from last year. At the time of his reporting, the 
        College was still waiting to hear from more than 100 students.</p>
      <p>- Members of the Lectures and Concerts committee floated a proposal to 
        put on a multi-day conference each spring, starting in 2004, organized 
        around a single word-the example given by members of the committee was 
        &quot;genius&quot;-that would draw students and faculty from every department 
        to lectures and public discussions. </p>
