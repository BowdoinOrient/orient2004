      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON-Some time in April, spring at last came to still-wintry 
        Maine. Suddenly, as one walked across campus, "there was a song in every 
        heart, a cheer on every face, and a spring in every step," as Mark Twain 
        put it in the opening of the whitewashing scene in Tom Sawyer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These words were quoted by me in a term paper on this 
        classic of American literature, written about the time of spring and submitted 
        to Herbie Brown, my Most Unforgettable Character among Bowdoin teachers, 
        at the last possible moment-shortly before midnight on the day it was 
        due. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read the book before, as a boy in war-time Germany, 
        I titled it "<i>Tom Sawyer</i> Re-Visited." As evacuee children, I wrote, 
        "we too lived and played with the village children...went to the one-room 
        village school...to learn and suffer under an old, bald-headed master," 
        though playing "soldiers," rather than "pirates and robbers." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brothers and I and other village children were "Toms 
        and Hucks of the twentieth century." Though <i>The Black Avenger of the 
        Spanish Main</i> was strictly fiction to us, "belonging to the secluded 
        world of reading after dark," the world of <i>Tom Sawyer</i> nevertheless 
        was reality, I said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only that instead of "the murder at midnight in the 
        graveyard," there was "the Russian soldier lying in his blood on a neighboring 
        farm." He was a POW just freed from a nearby camp by the Americans, yet 
        soon after gaining his freedom tragically shot by a deserted SS-man in 
        hiding on our neighbor's farm. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my diary, on the tenth anniversary of the gruesome 
        event, I recalled the exact date: May 1, 1945-exactly one week before 
        war's end in Europe. The freed Russians would roam the rural district 
        in small groups, going from farm to farm, asking for food, old clothing, 
        or anything else they might find useful. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bicycles, for example, were a precious commodity to 
        us in the countryside with public transport at a virtual standstill. When 
        one day they came to us too, not just asking for, but actually threatening 
        to take our bikes, a young Pole and former forced laborer who was friends 
        with us fortunately managed to dissuade them-in a crazy mixture of Pol 
        ish, broken Russian, and barracks-room German. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>These good Germans</i>, Tadeusz told them. <i>Go 
        to Nazi farmer next door</i>. Which they promptly did. But an altercation 
        between one of them, an impetuous young man it seems, and the farmer's 
        pretty daughter, possibly over her bike, was to have tragic results.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a shot rang out, we were later told, fired 
        by an unseen assailant yet at close range, killing the Russian instantly. 
        His mates fled in terror. Word of the killing swept through the village 
        like wildfire. Old and young alike came running to gawk at the dead man, 
        lying spread?eagled on his back, with a red stain on his white shirtfront 
        directly over the heart. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the first I'd ever seen. We approached the inert 
        body cautiously. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Der tut euch nichts mehr</i>, someone called out. 
        He won't hurt you no more. Hours later, while walking by a cornfield, 
        my brother and I suddenly saw men coming through the rye-ragged figures 
        dressed in bits and pieces of their former military clothing, stripped 
        of emblems and insignia, heading for the neighboring farm: the murdered 
        man's mates come back, with reinforcements, to take revenge. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the murderer had gotten away, they killed the 
        farmer's daughter. Her body-with head bashed in, though otherwise inviolate-later 
        was found in a nearby wood. These and other war-time memories ten years 
        later went into the writing of my term paper on <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned before, I only finished writing it close 
        to midnight on the day it was supposed to be turned in. Knowing Herbie 
        could, as a rule, still be found in his office on the first floor of the 
        library, just two minutes from the TD House, I hurried across the dark 
        campus, with only the paved path illuminated by lamp light. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Running up the stairs, taking two steps at a time, I 
        could see the light from his office, with the door always open, at the 
        end of the long, dark corridor, and I could hear the reassuring clatter 
        of his old-fashioned typewriter. "Ah, Mr. <i>Ra(h)ng</i>," he called out-always 
        careful to pronounce my name properly, with a long, flat vowel-"do come 
        in!" <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apologizing for turning my paper in at such a late hour, 
        I handed it to Herbie with my usual winsome smile. Smiling back at me 
        in the slightly queer way he had, Herbie took it, thanked me, and put 
        it on top of a big pile. Still out of breath from running up the stairs, 
        and as usual not knowing what else to say, I turned around and quickly 
        departed. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once outside in the hall again, I could hear the clatter 
        of the typewriter resuming almost immediately. Then I forgot all about 
        my paper. A week or so later, coming into the classroom (with tiered seats) 
        in Searles Hall, I noticed a stack of term papers on the long work-bench 
        out in front. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herbie's routine was to hand back graded papers to us, 
        one by one, as we filed out after the lecture. The grade, often with lengthy 
        critical comments, would be typed on one part of a blank sheet at the 
        back, folded lengthwise. In a change of routine, at the end of the lecture, 
        Herbie this time took up one from the top of the pile, saying he'd like 
        to read it out loud to the class. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd come across it late at night, he explained, intending 
        to glance at it only, but had literally been unable to put it down. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whose paper could that be?" I wondered. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me a while before I realized the one he was 
        reading out loud was mine-making me feel intensely embarrassed, yet also 
        proud. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd given it an "A plus." Next to the grade on the 
        back, he had typed just one comment: "This is a refreshing criticism of 
        the novel, and a delight to read." Frankly, I don't know how I made it 
        out of the classroom. All I remember is that once outside, there wasn't 
        only "a song in my heart" and a "spring in my step," but I was walking 
        on air. Balmy spring air. </p>
