      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the first Common Hour of the semester, the Bowdoin 
        community revived its collective spirit at Pickard Theater, where Assistant 
        Professor of Education Nancy Jennings spoke. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seats were filled with faculty and staff members 
        and students, who were eager to hear the speech of the Karofsky prize-winner, 
        one of the most popular professors at Bowdoin.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her talk, entitled "Ice fishing and engagement: Some 
        lessons from the classroom," dealt mainly with the important elements 
        of effective classroom learning that should be embodied in the Bowdoin 
        academic setting.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennings said that some of the most important things 
        that influence a learning experience are trust and spending time with 
        other people. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having trust and being able to work with other people, 
        according to Jennings, generates enormous productivity and stimulation, 
        since learners have the confidence to question and be challenged without 
        being demeaned or thought inferior. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory comes from her own experience in working 
        with colleagues in Minnesota when she was a school teacher. Jennings shared 
        her stories of how she learned immensely from talking with her colleagues 
        about subjects ranging from ice fishing to Buddhism. She concluded that 
        this effect was brought about by their confidence and devotion of time 
        and effort to working together.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue Jennings spoke of was the students' 
        willingness to distinguish themselves and take up roles, which does not 
        usually happen in class. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennings also pointed out the crucial target of being 
        in a classroom: maintaining the intellectual engagement that goes beyond 
        the completion of a task-the willingness to challenge, to confront, and 
        to defend an idea. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having taught at Bowdoin for almost six years, she expressed 
        her concern about the authority that students should give themselves to 
        speak up in class. She urged more participation in class discussions so 
        that learning goes beyond the completion of a task and a desire to live 
        up to certain academic expectations.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennings also expressed the need to embrace conflicts 
        and challenge opposing ideas, which she does not believe is readily observable 
        in the Bowdoin community. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "We need more 'I disagree'- more real arguments 
        instead of students backing off for fear of exclusivity in class."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this problem, Jennings proposed that students 
        should take the risk to speak up and defend their arguments during class 
        discussions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for faculty members, it is essential that they nurture 
        inclusiveness to encourage students as they make the effort to speak up.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last part of Common Hour was dedicated to a discussion 
        on how to improve class participation at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordinator of Multicultural Student Programs Wil Smith 
        '00 responded to the question by pointing out the homogeneity of expectations 
        that exist in the Bowdoin academic environment. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All students," Smith said, "have different academic 
        backgrounds, and thus different ways to view an issue." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This variety would be very useful if all students tried 
        to bring up their own perspectives, whether sociological, economic, political, 
        or educational. Smith then asked all students to take up the initiative 
        and be confident to bring up their experiences to their peers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another faculty member also stated a problem that she 
        saw constantly on campus. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students, when choosing classes and coming to class, 
        stick to their close friends instead of going out to try new things and 
        meet new people by themselves.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a perpetual phenomenon that hinders students 
        to open up-to face the real conflict needed to stimulate intellectual 
        exploration. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennings graduated from Macalester College and earned 
        her Ph.D. at Michigan State University. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her work has appeared in numerous education journals 
        including <i>Journal of Education Policy</i>, <i>Teachers College Record</i>, 
        and <i>Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis</i>. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her most recent work has focused on issues in rural 
        education. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennings is also the author of the book <i>Interpreting 
        Policy in Real Classrooms</i>. She has been honored by members of the 
        senior class as a teacher and a role model, and was selected to give the 
        annual Karofsky Encore Lecture, sponsored by the Karofsky Family Fund.
