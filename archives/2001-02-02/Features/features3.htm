      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oliver Howard had certainly come a long way by 1864. 
        From a young student at Bowdoin and then at West Point, he had grown as 
        a man and as a believer in the Creator of all things. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Civil War began, he was a colonel. Now, four 
        years later, he was a major general in command of one of the nation's 
        most venerable veteran armies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Battle of Jonesboro, south of Atlanta, Howard 
        held his own against repeated assaults by Confederate General William 
        Hardee's troops-consequently, Howard had tutored Hardee's daughters when 
        they were both at West Point, which was one of many coincidental meetings 
        between old comrades in the War for the Union. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Howard didn't know was that the Battle of Jonesboro 
        opened Atlanta to Federal occupation and was to be the last major battle 
        for Howard in this Civil War.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After taking Atlanta, William Tecumseh Sherman, the 
        overall commander of all troops in the west, prepared plans for a march 
        to the sea at Savannah. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Confederate army he had faced under Confederate 
        fighter John Bell Hood was still in the area and making its way towards 
        the Tennessee border, Sherman seemed not to care. He had detached a considerable 
        number of troops back to Tennessee to meet Hood. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If he will go to the Ohio River, I will give him rations. 
        My business is down south," Sherman commented. True to his word, he did 
        not glance back at Hood after he had chased him unsuccessfully for a number 
        of weeks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman's March to the Sea has long been one of the 
        greatest of Civil War legends. A "swath of destruction" sixty miles wide 
        and three hundred miles long is a part of almost every history book. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The march would eventually cause millions of dollars 
        worth of damage, but the effect of marching a fully equipped army through 
        the barrens of Georgia, right in the Confederate backyard was instrumental 
        in hastening the end of the War. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman had promised to make Georgia "howl" and this 
        he did with great pleasure.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile Oliver Howard was homesick. He had not been 
        home since the beginning of 1864, and now it was November. But Sherman 
        would not let him go. As commander of the Army of the Tennessee, Howard 
        needed to be around since he controlled the hardest hitters in Sherman's 
        force. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever his objections, Howard was soon not thinking 
        of the winters of Maine as Sherman moved his men out of Atlanta on November 
        15. Atlanta was blown to bits as the Federals left, preventing the rebels 
        from salvaging anything that could be used to further the rebellion cause.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The march was in two columns; on the right, moving down 
        the Macon & Western railroad, ripping track as he went, Howard and the 
        Army of the Tennessee made good time. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left, Henry W. Slocum's Army of Georgia did likewise 
        to everything that was in their path. Both wings feinted at numerous towns 
        along the way, in an attempt to confuse the rebels as to their position 
        and destination. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, the sixty thousand-man army had little to fear 
        from the rebels since there were none in the area, aside from a few cavalry 
        riders. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is probably the most gigantic pleasure excursion 
        ever planned," a soldier wrote, and in a sense, he was right. The men 
        were in excellent spirits. They raided farms and ate all they could find: 
        sweet potatoes, chickens, cows, ducks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they could not eat, they left for dead. Houses, 
        fields, cotton gins were burnt along the way. So vast were Sherman's armies 
        that the major commanders had little to do with any fighting that occurred. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Macon, Howard's one brigade rear guard mowed 
        down charging rebels, only to find out that the attackers had been old 
        men and children. Horrified at this cruel face of war, the men did not 
        know that this was only one of the few atrocities committed on the march. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a month, the men marched across Georgia, doing their 
        worst but keeping their energy for the chance they knew they would have 
        to wreck much more damage on South Carolina, the home of succession. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the buffet continued. As the men approached 
        Savannah and the coast on December 9, they began to consume oysters alongside 
        their usual diet of rich forage. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard was glad to see Savannah. On the march, he had 
        been unable to control his rowdy veterans who pillaged and plundered without 
        caring for his instructions. Now, with an enemy force to their front, 
        the men could at last return to their role as soldiers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turned out, Savannah was not a hard town to crack. 
        First, however, Sherman needed supplies from the Union supply ships out 
        in the Atlantic. The only obstacle was a rebel fort-Fort McAllister. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard sent one division to deal with the problem, and 
        within a matter of hours, the fort was in Union hands, and supplies began 
        to pour in. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 21, Savannah was abandoned, and Sherman 
        quickly wired President Lincoln that he was presenting the town to him 
        as a Christmas present. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what a present it was. Sherman had done what his 
        critics thought was impossible; he had marched sixty thousand men three 
        hundred miles through enemy territory with a casualty list of a mere 809 
        men. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his plans had suddenly been enlarged. Outside Petersburg, 
        Virginia, Grant was still deadlocked with Confederate General Robert E. 
        Lee. Now, Grant wanted his old friend Sherman to bring his men up the 
        coast to meet him for one final showdown battle with Lee in Virginia. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sherman was more than willing to comply. "We can punish 
        South Carolina as she deserves," he said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He set out on February 1, 1865, the final year of the 
        War. His destination this time was Goldsboro, North Carolina, 400 or so 
        miles from Savannah. His march would be conducted in the usual pattern-Howard 
        on the right, Slocum on the left. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late January, Sherman had sent Howard's men by boat 
        to Beaufort, South Carolina, fifty miles from Savannah. From there, Howard 
        marched on the railroad town of Pocotaligo, where he outflanked and drove 
        rebel defenders from their fortifications. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this late January shift was to confuse 
        the rebels as to Sherman's objective. Howard, the rebels reasoned, was 
        heading for Charleston while Slocum was headed for Augusta. In point of 
        fact, the conversion point was Columbia, South Carolina's capital. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during this time of planning and preparing troops 
        that Howard had the chance to visit the Sea Islands, laying between Savannah 
        and Charleston. These Islands had been under Union control since 1861 
        when naval forces had forced the Confederates to evacuate this part of 
        the coast. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southern plantation owners also left, leaving their 
        slaves and lands open to confiscation. Ever since then, the "Port Royal 
        Experiment" had been underway. This project entailed giving confiscated 
        lands to former slaves and teaching them how to cultivate them. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northerners also opened schools, and soon a flourishing 
        community of successful Freedmen was blooming. This "experiment" was conducted 
        in hopes that its results would pave the way for post-war treatment of 
        the Freedmen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howard was impressed with this setup and took great 
        joy in visiting some Freedmen's schools. He would, later in the year when 
        he was the Commissioner for the Freedmen's Bureau, look back at the Sea 
        Islands and use them as a blue print for his plans of reconstructing the 
        South. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(However, he later found that the plan was impractical 
        on a national scale.)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the War was still on. As the armies began 
        to move, the men found out that the backlands of Georgia and South Carolina 
        were not as welcoming as the rolling hills and farms of middle Georgia. 
        Swamps, flooded rivers, forests, and empty fields blocked Sherman's path. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Union commander had planned for such troubles. 
        His detail crews went ahead and cut down forests, made roads, and spanned 
        pontoon bridges across swollen rivers. The effect of this superb marching 
        force was an amazingly swift march through territory which had been deemed 
        impossible to pass. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confederate General Joseph Johnston, who had faced Sherman 
        in Georgia and now awaited him in South Carolina, amazed at Sherman's 
        movements, compared his opponent's army to that of Julius Caesar's.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, no matter the rainfall and the muddy roads, or 
        the hot days, the troops were in high spirits. On the way, they burnt 
        forests and sent miles of trees into smoldering smoky graves. Bright days 
        were turned into night as smoke filled the skies. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troops had taught Georgia a lesson, and now they 
        intended to destroy South Carolina. Having spared Savannah from the torch, 
        they had been promised a free hand in the crippling of South Carolina. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here is where treason began, and by God here is where 
        it shall end," many soldiers said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The savage energy in the men was horrifying even to 
        Sherman himself. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I almost tremble for her [South Carolina's] fate, but 
        feel that she deserves all that seems in store for her," the Federal commander 
        wrote. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mid-February, Howard's leading elements came within 
        sight of Columbia.</p>
