      <p>&nbsp; From the amount of bleeding palms on Bowdoin students this past 
        week, one would think the whole campus had received the stigmata. But 
        rather than any painful reward for religious piety, these war wounds have 
        been incurred by a spate of particularly nasty winter weather.<br>
        &nbsp; Not only were students caught unaware, but it seems that the usually 
        meteorlogically clairvoyant grounds crew were also surprised by the storm. 
        No salt stood waiting on the pavement for the icy onslaught of the past 
        few days. Nor, as many students complained, were salt and sand particularly 
        fast in coming to the rescue of those students who left their crampons 
        behind before returning to campus for the "spring" semester.<br>
        &nbsp; Parking lots proved particularly arduous, whether on foot or in 
        car. For those lucky enough to safely return home to Pine Street Apartments 
        for example, there was a brief but nevertheless arduous ascent from the 
        parking lot to the haven of the apartments. Those exiting the parking 
        lot by car skidded dangerously along the slick surface.<br>
        &nbsp; While the cornucopia of black, blue, purple, red, and variously 
        hued arses add needed color to this desolate white campus, when the next 
        storm hits we hope Bowdoin will be prepared. It really is a hard and thankless 
        task to plow this campus during the nearly never ending winter, and the 
        Orient applauds the ground screw for managing as well as it has. <br>
        &nbsp; Still, there is always room for improvement and we beseech the 
        grounds crew to be just a little more liberal with the salt and sand for 
        the next couple months. Our hearts, hands, and arses will thank them.</p>
