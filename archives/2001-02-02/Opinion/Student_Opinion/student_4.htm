      <p>&nbsp; In the wake of the recent election, much has been made of the 
        ongoing failure of America's youth to participate in politics. A quick 
        (and ridiculously unscientific) survey of several of my friends has yielded 
        a few common explanations for our generation's collective civic apathy. 
        Though a few noted resentfully that they feel their views go ignored by 
        traditional politicians, the most popular complaint was that "politics 
        is just boring." <br>
        &nbsp; I, for one, could not disagree more. From the flying sparks and 
        personal attacks to whispered rumors and backroom compromises, from the 
        polished rhetoric and legalistic wrangling to the passionate harangues 
        and the raw emotion, politics in America gives me a thrill unrivaled by 
        anything this side of Pedro Martinez. After much thought on the subject, 
        I concluded that America's youth must be missing out on something. Popular 
        coverage of politics, after all, is hardly zestful or, for that matter, 
        even didactic in nature. The secret, then, must lie in introducing to 
        the Nintendo generation some of the characters that can provide our political 
        scene with drama worthy of Shakespeare and comedy worthy of the Marx Brothers.

        &nbsp; Certainly the most incendiary person in Congress these days is 
        truculent Ohio Democrat James Traficant. Known for his penchant for ditching 
        the party line and his tendency to make wild claims about his political 
        opponents, Traficant recently jumped into the national spotlight by supporting 
        Republican Dennis Hastert for the House Speakership. "I wasn't elected 
        to turn over a fucking voting card to (Democratic Leader) Dick Gephart," 
        he remarked bitterly. Democrats, not amused by the reckless apostate, 
        have vowed revenge. "He'll be made chairman of the sub-subcommittee on 
        public restrooms," predicted one Democratic consultant. <br>
        &nbsp; Being investigated for ties to organized crime in his Rust Belt 
        district has done little to quiet the outspoken Traficant, who first rose 
        to prominence as one of the few county sheriffs who refused to enact foreclosure 
        orders on the homes of unemployed steel workers in the early 1980s. After 
        surviving an attempt by a political rival to have him committed for insanity, 
        Traficant has been elected to Congress seven times, often by large margins. 
        His web site features a wickedly funny animation of the surly, sideburned 
        Traficant glowering at the camera and swinging a two-by-four with the 
        legend "Banging away in Washington, D.C." emblazoned boldly on the side. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Though one would expect a man with a history of criminal investigations 
        as comprehensive as Traficant's to avoid making rash allegations, the 
        Ohio Congressman has been more than happy to inveigh violently against 
        all those who offend his sensibilities. In the last year, Traficant has 
        called Janet Reno a "traitor" for refusing to investigate Chinese campaign 
        contributions and been heard loudly questioning the legitimacy of the 
        prosecutors checking into his convoluted personal affairs. "I tell him 
        to keep his god-damned mouth shut," says Democratic political boss and 
        Traficant friend Don Hanni, "but telling him what to do is like kicking 
        a mule in the ass." <br>
        &nbsp; Even more bizarre than this is Traficant's language on the floor 
        of the House. He has argued on behalf of canceled television shows, accused 
        White House foreign policy experts of "smoking dope," defended the "Buckeye 
        vixens" and "foxy ladies" of the Ohio State women's rugby team, and routinely 
        uses the Star Trek phrase "beam me up" to express his displeasure with 
        various initiatives. Short speeches to Congress about the wonder of "old 
        reliable" toilets, the terrible possibility of Viagra for dogs and the 
        potentially treasonous nature of children's toys are among the other Traficant 
        classics. Now tell me - do you still think American politics is boring?
