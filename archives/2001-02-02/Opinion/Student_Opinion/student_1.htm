      <p>&nbsp; Last Wednesday, President Bush made good on his number one campaign 
        promise to try to achieve meaningful education reform and put forth his 
        plan to help better educate our youth. Yet, almost instantaneously after 
        the announcing of his plan by White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher, 
        the Democrats began criticizing it and, in turn, laid out their own plan, 
        a plan that is, in many regards, similar to that of Bush's, but with language 
        strongly in opposition to a school voucher program, leaving little room 
        for compromise.<br>
        &nbsp; During the 2000 presidential campaign, the issue of school vouchers 
        accounted for one of the most distinct differences between former Vice 
        President Gore and President Bush's philosophy on government. In an election 
        that resulted in a clearly divided electorate, the effects of which are 
        still being echoed by such partisan showings as Senator Ted Kennedy's 
        threat to possibly filibuster the nomination of Attorney General nominee 
        John Ashcroft on the Senate floor, the debate over school vouchers was 
        as divisive as the election that spurred it. <br>
        &nbsp; To both of their credits, Republicans and Democrats made specific 
        concessions to each other in their most recent education plans, in order 
        to get something done in a bipartisan fashion: For his part, Bush has 
        decided to set aside $10 billion more for federal education programs than 
        he previously said he would during the campaign. By showing a willingness 
        to invest more money into an entitlement program like Title One, the type 
        of program that Democrats normally allocate the bulk of their budget and 
        any expected surplus to, Bush is making a sufficient compromise, as well 
        as furthering his position towards the political center. And, in their 
        own show of bipartisanship, congressional Democrats have taken a harder 
        stance on the amount of responsibility and accountability to be placed 
        on schools and the teachers of schools when student test scores do not 
        improve after federal money has been appropriated in order to reach that 
        very end. Like Bush, Democrats are showing a genuine effort to reach out 
        to the opposing party and give the American people what they want, which 
        is the bettering of our education system <br>
        &nbsp; The civil nature with which both parties have attempted to pass 
        effective education reform deserves some praise from the American people. 
        Yet don't be too generous with your accolades quite yet, because without 
        reaching a compromise on the highly polarizing issue of school vouchers, 
        there will not be a bill that has any practical chance of passing up for 
        a vote on the floor any time soon.<br>
        &nbsp; Both parties are to blame for this stalemate. But, with not even 
        being willing to run a test program on school vouchers to see if they 
        work, I think the Democrats should take the brunt of the criticism on 
        this one. <br>
        &nbsp; Democrats continue to be strident proponents of vouchers because 
        they believe that any money used for a voucher program is money that could 
        have been put to better use by investing it in our public schools. This 
        is a valid concern. But, considering Democrats are usually inclined to 
        favor public schools over private ones because of their close association 
        with the teachers' unions, even if they did feel the idea of vouchers 
        had some merit, they would not be able to voice their opinion without 
        risking the support of teachers. Furthermore, it stinks of hypocrisy when 
        a candidate like Al Gore, who managed to send two of his daughters to 
        expensive private schools, denies the same opportunity to families who 
        are not as well off.<br>
        &nbsp; After eight years of pumping money into unproductive public schools 
        under the Clinton Administration, the United States still ranks behind 
        world powers such as China in reading and math. Still Democrats would 
        be happy to continue funding failing public schools, and they will probably 
        be able to do just that, since a majority of Americans agree with their 
        position. However, I would think a party that prides itself so much on 
        supposedly being responsible for the unprecedented economic good times 
        we are currently experiencing would be more concerned with keeping the 
        good times rolling by making sure our children receive the best education 
        possible-whether it be public or private-rather than worrying about merely 
        losing the votes of a few teachers. </p>
