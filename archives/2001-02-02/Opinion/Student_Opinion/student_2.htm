      <p>&nbsp; I was going to avoid joining the fray about Bowdoin parking, but 
        I witnessed an event yesterday that made me understand exactly why my 
        fellow Bowdoin students are so upset about this fiasco. I hereby submit 
        this story in the hope that it will seem as crazy to you as it did to 
        me.<br>
        &nbsp; As a student teacher, I have occasion to awaken very early in the 
        morning and to be out of the Tower and heading toward the Coffin lot at 
        around 6:30 a.m. I have seen cars being towed on several of my morning 
        trips and, although this seems pretty unfair, it also seems to fit within 
        the College's parking guidelines.<br>
        &nbsp; However, I was heading toward the parking lot yesterday when I 
        spotted a tow truck, idling near the "Faculty" section of the Coffin lot. 
        "Oh, man," I thought to myself. "Some poor guy or gal is getting towed." 
        When I got closer, though, I noticed that the tow truck wasn't actually 
        doing anything. There was no car on the back. It was just sitting in the 
        parking lot.<br>
        &nbsp; That looked weird to me, but it was no weirder than what I was 
        about to observe. For as I approached my car, the tow truck drove out 
        of the "Faculty" section, and began to circle around the rest of the lot. 
        The driver stopped in front of a car that had been ticketed, got out, 
        looked at the ticket, and got back in. It seemed (to me, at least) that 
        this tow truck driver was looking for people to tow.<br>
        &nbsp; Now, I understand that it is important to preserve parking spaces 
        for the faculty, staff, and senior students who live on campus. I get 
        incredibly annoyed when, after a long day of teaching, I return to Coffin 
        lot to find that there are no spaces available. However, it seems dishonest 
        that the towing company-who is obviously making a tidy profit off of Bowdoin 
        students' cars-is acting so proactively. In the course of doing extensive 
        research for this article (research that involved me talking to my roommates), 
        I found out that, in fact, others have witnessed the tow truck simply 
        "hanging around" campus. If Security wants to enforce parking regulations, 
        that's one thing. On the other hand, if the towing company is taking the 
        initiative for enforcing Bowdoin's parking regulations, that's another 
        thing entirely. <br>
        &nbsp; It is possible that I witnessed this event incorrectly, and that 
        Security had called the towing company, and that the towing company had 
        come to campus with a particular car in mind. However, as I drove out 
        of Coffin lot, so did the tow truck. Food for thought, huh?</p>
