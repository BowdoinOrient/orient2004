      <p>&nbsp; The ice season is upon us. Not winter. Not spring. Not even the 
        mud season. And out of all those three, it's definitely my favorite. Not 
        because I enjoy the bitter cold that is bound to accompany it, nor because 
        I like being pelted in the face with shards of frozen water as I walk 
        to the Field House. No, I like the ice season for nothing that nature 
        packages with it. In fact, I despise winter. Any weather that causes your 
        shoulders to rise to the level of your ears as you scurry across the quad 
        inevitably elicits some sort of distaste. So why exactly is ice season 
        my favorite?<br>
        &nbsp; Let's face it: walkways dressed in clear, shimmering ice are beautiful. 
        More beautiful, in fact, if those aesthetically coated paths happen to 
        be the avenue of an adventurous sole. Those soles of course being we Bowdoin 
        students who only traverse these treacherous crossings because they are 
        the only way to get from here to there. It is the necessity of their utilization 
        that makes for some great entertainment. And entertainment is enough to 
        make anything your favorite, especially when it adheres a smile to your 
        face.<br>
        &nbsp; Everyone knows that one of the most singular humorous events to 
        occur is that of a person falling. It's the lack of grace - the wild antics 
        as one tumbles, and the ultimate splatter across the ground - that is 
        enough to send anyone into a fit of laughter. Of course, everyone harbors 
        a sense of guilt as they laugh at the poor person in front of them as 
        they just, as a boulder falling from a cliff, slipped down the final steps 
        of the building you are about to enter. But guilt has only enough persuasion 
        to allow you to harvest some self-control, maintain a semi-straight face, 
        as you ask the luckless person if they are okay. Inevitably, the fallen 
        hero will always answer yes, even if they know a vertebra has been crushed 
        or a kneecap misplaced. Embarrassment always hides the fact that something 
        bodily may have been harmed.<br>
        &nbsp; Needless to say, after surviving a good twenty winters, I have 
        witnessed many falls. Falls which have ranged from a mere loss of balance 
        to all out wipe-outs, you know the kind, when feet up end and the person's 
        back is the first spot to make contact with the frozen ground. These are 
        the only kinds that elude embarrassment, as usually the person is so shocked 
        and in pain, they care not to even get up. Anyways, I've realized that 
        there is a difference between the way men and women fall. <br>
        &nbsp; Men on the average try to deny the fact that they are falling. 
        As in a last attempt to maintain any shred of decency, they believe they 
        can right themselves again mid-air and miraculously land upon their feet. 
        Of course, this always fails, and their arms go flying and their heads 
        go bobbing, and they crash to the ground with an unceremonious thump. 
        Their return to their feet tends to be slow, and they often have no shame 
        in making sure all four limbs are functioning. Women, however, are quiet 
        different. And from my experience, a lot more humorous to watch stumble. 
        Generally, women readily accept the fact that they are about to make an 
        outlandish journey to the ground below them. In an effort to get the fall 
        over with as quickly as possible, they succumb to the fall. No arms flying, 
        no legs spreading, they just fall. However, it is the women's preoccupation 
        with image that is most hilarious of all. She will quickly get up, and 
        continue on her merry way as if nothing had just happened, as if she had 
        planned to fall. Even if her legs are throbbing, she will get up and walk. 
        A furtive glance to make sure no one is looking, and she is on her way. 
        As far as she realizes, no one noticed her fall. But I did. And that's 
        why I'm smiling.<br>
        &nbsp; I've also realized that everyone must make an embarrassing fall 
        at least once each winter season, not just a little spill or loss of balance, 
        but a complete wipe out that results in at least a decent bruise and most 
        often is performed in front of a crowd of people. Some people are lucky, 
        and get their wipe out over with early in the year, but others must wait, 
        fearing the day that they too will be the provider of so many people's 
        laughs. Last year I was lucky, my spill came in early January, on my way 
        to Wentworth. Little did I notice the patch of black ice waiting for my 
        arrival, and less did I realize the split that I was supposed to do. I'm 
        no ballerina, and my legs just don't bend that way. Let's just say I was 
        quite the topic of dinner conversation that evening. I'm yet to fall this 
        year, I'm hoping it happens soon, and I'm hoping that only I will be witness 
        to the event. So, here's to the ice season, and to all the falls you all 
        will be taking. And don't worry, the rest of us will be laughing. </p>
