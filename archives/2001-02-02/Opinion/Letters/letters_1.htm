      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; The introduction to Erik Sprague's article gave me the impression 
        that I was about to read a flippant, uninformed piece. I was not disappointed. 
        Equating the election to a game of Command and Conquer is silly, as the 
        battlefield Sprague refers to was actually states' electoral votes, which 
        have nothing to do with the geographical area Sprague seems concerned 
        with. To continue the juvenile analogy, one could point out that George 
        Bush certainly didn't dominate if "troop numbers" (American voters) were 
        counted, as Al Gore won the popular vote. Sheer numbers are sadly as useless 
        in determining the presidency as square miles, however, as Bush had the 
        advantage in the Electoral College. The College, of course, is a system 
        designed more than two centuries ago as part of a racist ploy to grant 
        more power to the southern slave owners. Allowed by the Three-Fifths Compromise 
        to count their non-voting slaves as fractional people in determining their 
        states' representation, bigots scored a victory. On the topic of bigots, 
        I would now like to shed some light on Attorney General Designee John 
        Ashcroft.<br>
        &nbsp; While much worse things could be said about him, John Ashcroft 
        is at least not the epitome of tolerance that should be required if one 
        is to hold a position of power in this diverse nation. I take exception 
        to much of Sprague's column in addition to his opinion of the man, to 
        which he has a right. For starters, Ashcroft is thankfully not yet the 
        Attorney General. He has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, which had 
        every right to grill the man, because of a process set up by the Constitution 
        known as checks and balances. <br>
        &nbsp; Sprague does not seem to grasp the significance of the Senators' 
        probing, or that of the office of Attorney General itself. Sprague attempts 
        to make his case using percentage statistics and moral judgments, neither 
        of which are terribly accurate or objective. Moreover, the statistics, 
        through which Sprague attempts to align Ashcroft's views with those of 
        the American people, are moot. The job of the Attorney General is to enforce 
        the nation's laws, not create new ones or bend current laws to what he 
        or she believes to be "public opinion."<br>
        &nbsp; Thankfully for the great numbers of raped women, couples with failed 
        contraception, and pregnant women with severe health complications, abortion 
        was legalized by the Judicial Branch of the government, an act which the 
        Executive branch (to which Ashcroft, as a cabinet member, would belong) 
        is not supposed to reverse. Checks and balances again. That Janet Reno 
        was not questioned about her "support" of dilation and extraction (the 
        medical term supplanted in pro-life rhetoric by "partial birth," which 
        refers to the method by which the fetus is terminated, even in the second 
        trimester) abortions makes sense; how would it adversely affect her jvTopicsed 
        to enforce? Sprague also shows some confusion over the reproductive process, 
        in which conception and fertilization are one and the same.<br>
        &nbsp; Addressing Sprague's first gripe, with Al Gore's "radical" gun 
        control policy, one of the biggest reasons Gore lost the election was 
        that he was received as TOO compromising. If not for his middle-of-the-road 
        stance on so many issues, the truly left-wing Ralph Nader would have taken 
        many fewer of Gore's votes. Once again, Sprague's grasp of politics seems 
        a bit weak, as he implies Gore's position was "politically correct" after 
        discussing how it cost him the election.<br>
        &nbsp; Sprague's treatment of the death penalty issue is not so much fallacious 
        as it is mere opinion. To consider any Kennedy politically impotent is 
        naïve. Secondly, if you find dialogue on the correctness of institutionalized 
        murder "sickening," try thinking about flipping the switch to cook a fellow 
        human being, or plunging a syringe of poison into his arm. After all, 
        someone like Ronnie White, who even "showed reluctance" to signing someone's 
        death warrant is incompetent. Finally, Sprague's comment about term limits 
        for Senators is simply inane. Like the heroic Ashcroft Sprague portrays, 
        Ted Kennedy was "simply looking out for the well-being of his constituents." 
        Those, as I am sure even Sprague is aware, are the people of Massachusetts, 
        in which conservatives like Sprague comprise a small minority.<br>
        &nbsp; Most importantly, Sprague failed to even address the most important 
        issues which make Ashcroft unsuitable. As Senator, Governor, and Missouri 
        Attorney General, he regularly discriminated against both blacks (like 
        the aforementioned white) and homosexuals such as James Hormel and Paul 
        Offner. By disqualifying talented applicants such as these from positions 
        because of his strong religious beliefs, Ashcroft showed himself to be 
        a bigot unworthy of a position which would allow him the power to vent 
        his prejudices by uneven law enforcement. For example, capital punishment, 
        which Sprague holds so dear, is already applied very disproportionately 
        to blacks; with a racist model like John Ashcroft, imagine how skewed 
        the figures could become. Even if his pledges to uphold laws that he is 
        opposed to can be believed, the Attorney General has many other duties, 
        including the appointment of justices. It would be fully within his domain, 
        and even his promises, to nominate judges possessing his own narrow-minded 
        views, potentially setting back the civil rights of millions of Americans.<br>
        &nbsp; Finally, Sprague's concluding paragraph showcases the utter lack 
        of political insight displayed by his article. How has President Bush 
        "tried his best to mend the fences between a starkly divided country" 
        by choosing someone as inflammatory as Ashcroft for Attorney General? 
        Many of his other nominations have been nearly as controversial. Sprague 
        also makes the principle of compromise seem altruistic, as if Bush were 
        trying to do liberals a favor out of the good of his heart, and blame 
        Democrats for "partisan politics." A tremendous ability to meet opponents 
        half way on issues allowed Bill Clinton to achieve so much in office, 
        yet his enemies criticized his compromises as being wishy-washy. Without 
        the wholly partisan impeachment persecution taking up so much of his time 
        and the taxpayers' money, he could have done even more to better our country 
        and the world. If George Bush thinks as Sprague does, that to "govern 
        as he sees fit" means throwing conciliation to the wind, he will be the 
        lamest duck ever to hold the office of President, and lawmaking will come 
        to a standstill for the next four years. </p>
