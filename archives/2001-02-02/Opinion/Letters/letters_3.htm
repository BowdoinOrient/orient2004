      <p>To the Bowdoin Community:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are writing this letter to inform students, staff, and 
        faculty about a calendar issue that affects us all.<br>
        &nbsp; The Thanksgiving Break for Bowdoin College begins each year after 
        classes on Wednesday, leaving students with several difficult options. 
        Students are forced either to travel on one of the busiest travel days 
        of the year, skip classes and leave campus early, or simply to stay on 
        campus for break. Many faculty recognize this inherent difficulty and 
        cancel their Wednesday class well in advance. Others do so on the day 
        of class because of poor student attendance.<br>
        &nbsp; In an attempt to change this, the Student Government (the Student 
        Executive Board and Student Congress) has drafted and supported a proposal 
        requesting the Wednesday before Thanksgiving be given as a vacation day 
        and that this "lost" academic day be placed elsewhere in the first semester 
        schedule.<br>
        &nbsp; In an online poll of over 400 students, 96% responded that they 
        would like Thanksgiving Break to be lengthened by one day. A check of 
        peer institutions revealed that the vast majority, including Amherst, 
        Bates, and Wesleyan, do not have Wednesday classes. Student Government 
        took this overwhelming student reaction and the supporting data to create 
        a proposal requesting that classes be canceled on the Wednesday preceding 
        Thanksgiving.<br>
        &nbsp; The message that the College is sending to students from the West 
        Coast, Northern Maine, or elsewhere, is not good when it comes to this 
        break. If we want to increase our diversity, we must make a sincere effort.<br>
        &nbsp; We feel that there are ample reasons as to why the break should 
        be increased but there are many important issues to take into consideration.<br>
        &nbsp; As the student body responded in an email survey, students would 
        be more than willing to return one day earlier at the beginning of the 
        semester; therefore starting classes on a Wednesday and not a Thursday. 
        Other possibilities include going one day later into the semester or giving 
        professors the option to reschedule the time they would miss with their 
        class and allow the professor to hold class at a convenient time for both 
        students and faculty.<br>
        &nbsp; Although some would argue that starting break on a Tuesday would 
        make it so many students would skip the whole week of classes, we strongly 
        believe that that will not occur. This is not a problem at our peer institutions 
        where Wednesday classes are not held. <br>
        &nbsp; The Thanksgiving Break proposal unanimously passed the Student 
        Congress in early December and then moved onto the Calendar Committee 
        where committee members strongly supported the bill. Now, after consideration 
        by the Recording Committee, the issue will be discussed at next Monday's 
        Faculty Meeting and voted on at a subsequent meeting.<br>
        &nbsp; We, as the Student Government, would like to encourage the Faculty 
        and Senior Staff to take the time to consider and support this proposal. 
        The "lost" academic day can be made up in one of a few ways and the message 
        that the school would be sending to students is a good one; a message 
        of concern for safety and of a desire to commit itself to greater geographical 
        diversity.<br>
        &nbsp; Please contact us with any questions.</p>
