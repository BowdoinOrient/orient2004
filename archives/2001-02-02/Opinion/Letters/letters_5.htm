      <p>To the Editors: </p>
      <p>&nbsp; I would like to begin by thanking all those who have responded 
        so positively to the new online face book and sincerely apologize to any 
        students whose pictures might have been used irresponsibly. <br>
        &nbsp; If, at any time throughout the semester, someone wishes to take 
        their picture off line, please email me or contact the Office of Student 
        Records directly and it will be taken care of immediately. <br>
        &nbsp; I hope that as the newness of the directory wears off there will 
        be less misuse and that the abuses of a few will not overshadow its benefits 
        as a convenient resource to connect names to faces and even build a sense 
        of community in a very basic way. <br>
        &nbsp; I would also like to thank the editors of the Orient for voicing 
        their sincere opinion on this and creating a forum for discussions such 
        as these. <br>
        &nbsp; With that said, I strongly disagree that the face book is a "misstep." 
        There will always be abuse of resources, but as long as the benefits outweigh 
        the costs, these resources should not be withheld from students. <br>
        &nbsp; I also disagree that the face book, however beneficial, was our 
        central priority of the semester. We spent just as much time on issues 
        such as reforming student government itself, making Thanksgiving break 
        more practical for students, planning Common Hours (don't miss Wil Smith 
        on March 2), and creating forums for discussion of the House system which 
        will appear early this semester. <br>
        &nbsp; These issues are all complex and take time; results to some will 
        be seen very shortly, other issues take far longer than any one student's 
        career at Bowdoin. <br>
        &nbsp; My biggest arguement, however, is with the Orient's claim that 
        "our hefty tuition contributions to the College purchase us some right 
        of representation before Bowdoin's powers that be." <br>
        &nbsp; It is true that students are represented on every Trustee, Faculty, 
        and College committee, but what our hefty tuition contributions buy us 
        is not the chance to sit back as others represent us, but instead the 
        chance to engage ourselves for four years at a college which gives us 
        every opportunity to pursue our ideas about how to improve aspects of 
        Bowdoin life or the entire college itself. <br>
        &nbsp; If you want something done, have a suggestion, or just want to 
        voice your opinion, then do it. If you're not happy with something about 
        student government or the college in general, then fix it. Call me at 
        x5996, email me at mmacneil, check out our website at www.bowdoin.edu/studgov, 
        or run for office this spring. <br>
        &nbsp; Contrary to the Orient's calendar section, all are welcome at exec 
        board meetings Mondays at 9:00 p.m. and Student Congress meetings every 
        Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. in Hubbard Conference West. <br>
        &nbsp; You could stand outside and try heckling and intimidating us as 
        the Orient suggests, but at a solid 5'1", I can be pretty intimidating 
        myself, so you might think twice about that one. If heckling isn't for 
        you, I suggest just coming in, sitting down, and talking with us; even 
        the editors of the Orient might be suprised at how well that works.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br>
        Meghan MacNeil '03 <br>
        Vice Chair, Student Executive Board </p>
