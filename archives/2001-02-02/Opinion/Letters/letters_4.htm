      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; I am writing in response to Ben Gott's column in last week's paper. 
        While he is entitled to his opinion, I believe his generalizations of 
        how seniors feel towards their schoolwork and their areas of study deserves 
        a reply. Gott's advice to first years that "the 'sameness' of it all will 
        start to get to you" is disheartening to those beginning their academic 
        journey and insulting to those almost finished. I, for one, have never 
        felt that my papers have "blurred together," with each one presenting 
        a new challenge, or at the very least, a new angle on ideas and concepts. 
        I'm not saying I enjoyed them all, but the process never bored me. Bowdoin's 
        liberal arts offerings allows each of us the opportunity to experiment 
        with a myriad of different subjects and areas of study, staving off boredom 
        and frustration resulting from the "sameness" that Gott claims is omnipresent 
        within the senior class. Ben, if you have found that your classes have 
        started to blur together into a singular species, perhaps you should not 
        look at it as a characteristic of Bowdoin's overall educational program, 
        but rather as a characteristic of the course of studies that you have 
        chosen. That your entire final semester seems devoted to education classes 
        or teaching experience seems to support this possibility. <br>
        &nbsp; There are a few other items within Gott's article that leave me 
        disappointed. His suggestion that the best time at Bowdoin, his "light 
        at the end of the tunnel," consists of the least amount of studying or 
        learning seems to run against Bowdoin's character. Should three classes, 
        four-day weeks, and parties with good beer summarize the best that Bowdoin 
        has to offer? I disagree. The best that Bowdoin has to offer is five classes, 
        120-hour weeks, and an extra two hours miraculously found during the weekend 
        to relax with friends and just enjoy each other's company (Good beer doesn't 
        hurt however). It's crazy and tiring, but I wouldn't trade the semesters 
        I've had like that for seven of Ben's idealized schedules. Bowdoin is 
        a place that is about learning. It is at its best when we work our hardest. 
        We forget sometimes that we are not here just for the scenery, the weekends, 
        and two for Tuesdays down at Players. It's a nice idea, but I wouldn't 
        want to be there in reality.<br>
        &nbsp; Am I tired of being a student? No. I'm one of those "noble beings" 
        Ben salutes as I face the reality of a few more years in graduate school. 
        I would suggest, however, that I and my fellow students heading off to 
        further formal education next year will not be the only "perpetual students" 
        of the class of 2001. Anyone who continues to learn is a student. Anyone 
        who is involved in the investigation, examination or study of a subject 
        is a student. Ironically, the only people who are professional students 
        are teachers. They are the ones who must take information, old and new, 
        find its value and transmit it to new generations. I hope it is only writing 
        papers that you are tired of Ben, for it is my belief that in order to 
        be a good teacher you can never stop being a student.</p>
