      <p>To the Editors:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am writing in response to the column written by Erik 
        Sprague, "Ashcroft is A-OK with this guy", that appeared in last week's 
        issue of the Bowdoin Orient. The article struck me as bizarre not so much 
        for Mr. Sprague's support of John Ashcroft but rather for the irresponsible 
        way in which facts were presented in the article without being backed 
        up by concrete sources. I understand that it was an opinion piece, however 
        I do not find this reason enough to make sweeping statements without bothering 
        to investigate their truth. <br>
        &nbsp; For example, Mr. Sprague contends that forty percent of the United 
        States population does not support a woman's right to obtain an abortion 
        and that eighty percent are against dilation and extraction procedures 
        (commonly referred to by the politically naïve as "partial birth abortions"). 
        I wonder from which source he attained these statistics? He also goes 
        on to state that the death penalty is "…a practice that is favored by 
        about two-thirds of the population." <br>
        &nbsp; A phrase that I found rather humorous was the opening statement 
        of the second paragraph, "Let's take gun control for starters. Why do 
        you think Gore managed to be one of only a few presidential candidates 
        to ever lose his home state?" I do not understand exactly what he is driving 
        at here, perhaps he means to insinuate that Gore lost Tennessee only because 
        of his pro-gun control stance? Can politics ever be that simple? Perhaps 
        Mr. Sprague has some profound insight on the issue, but unfortunately 
        for those of us not as studied in the subject, he did not bother to prove 
        how he reached this illuminating conclusion.<br>
        &nbsp; In writing an article, it is far too easy to piece together partial-truths 
        and outright fabrications in order to use them to defend a controversial 
        point of view. Thankfully at a school like Bowdoin College, the general 
        community has enough critical reading skills to identify poor journalism 
        as just that. A very interesting webpage that readers can go to is www.roevsbush.com, 
        under the auspices of Planned Parenthood. The page includes links to various 
        articles published in major newspapers around the country about Ashcroft 
        and what Mr. Sprague would have us believe are his non-extremist views.</p>
