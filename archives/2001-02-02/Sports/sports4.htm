      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Picture this: jacked female athletes destroying their 
        competition, leaving their good sportsmanship intact, while spectators 
        watch the seemingly effortless performances (oh if they only knew). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were one of the fans watching the Bowdoin women 
        defeat Tufts, Middlebury, Colby, and Springfield last weekend this would 
        not be very difficult to do. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women entered the meet aware of the tough competition 
        they would be faced with and hoped to run strong races and perform the 
        best they had all season; they did. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weekend also provided the opportunity for some of 
        the team's athletes to demonstrate their versatility. Of particular notice 
        was sophomore triple jumper Acadia Senese's fourth place finish in the 
        55m dash, as well as her fourth place finish in the triple jump. Similarly, 
        sophomore sprinter Andrea Weeks's seventh place finish in the 200m and 
        first place performance in the long jump stands out.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women have been working hard throughout the season 
        and hope to prove themselves at both the Maine State Meet and New England's. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Captain Erin Lyman has been a driving force in 
        the distances races and comments of the team's success that "I think success 
        comes with the perfect mix of positive attitude and hard work. Our team 
        exemplifies what it takes to be successful, and we have proved it on the 
        track these past three meets. I don't know of many other teams that have 
        as much fun while taking their sport so seriously."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other top performances include sophomore Sara Bodnar's 
        second place finish in the 55m dash and first-year Kristen Dummer's second 
        place finish in the 200m. Dummer has been an excellent addition to the 
        team after recovering from a high school injury with her solid performances 
        in both the individual sprint events and the sprint relays.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle distance events were also strong for the Bowdoin 
        women with Sara Hardy '02 finishing fourth in the 400m, Julia Febiger 
        '03 third in the 600m, Kate Waller '02 second in the 800m and Libby Barney 
        placing second in the 1000m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field events also provided opportunities for the 
        women to stand out. The pole-vaulters dominated the field with third, 
        fifth, and sixth place finishes by Marika Decyk '02, Liz Wendell '03, 
        and Anne Barmettler's '02. The jumping events were also strong with Weeks's 
        and Wendell's first and fourth place finishes in long jump and second 
        and fourth place finishes in triple jump by Kelley '02 and Senese.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the women have turned out some strong performances 
        and fortunately the team remains healthy and excited to improve upon their 
        performances. This Saturday the team will compete against Coast Guard 
        and Connecticut College at the Coat Guard Academy's 180m indoor track 
        (as opposed to the standard 200m indoor track). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will affect the women's race strategies and present 
        the women with more turns to run throughout their race. Though this aspect 
        of the meet is less than ideal, the women are ready to run faster, throw 
        farther, and jump higher and farther! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck women! GO U BEARS!! </p>
