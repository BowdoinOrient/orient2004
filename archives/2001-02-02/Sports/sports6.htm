      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forget about the new Budweiser commercial. Forget about 
        the pre-game show and the half-time production. Forget about these things 
        because they're not football and you are a football fan. And despite what 
        some might say, Super Bowl XXXV was how football is meant to be played.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After nine years of championship games focused on the 
        offense, what we found in Tampa was a defense-dominated game. The scoring 
        machines of Dallas, San Francisco, and Green Bay have long since shut 
        down; now relegated to the middle of the NFL pack. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the back of the shelves-their unattractive appearances 
        hiding true value- come the Baltimore Ravens and New York Giants. No Troy 
        Aikman or Jerry Rice lead either franchise through the 2000-2001 NFL season, 
        but they managed to get to the big game anyway. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's because it wasn't about offense during the season, 
        and it wasn't about offense during the Super Bowl. It was about the kind 
        of football you hear about from Ditka and Madden on NFL films late at 
        night. It was about two defenses that claimed nothing and got nothing…except 
        a chance to play for the Vince Lombardi trophy. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fans who complained about a lack of smashmouth football 
        for years now suddenly turned their backs on the Ravens and Giants because 
        neither team has star players. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No one wants to see Trent Dilfer and Kerry Collins 
        battle it out," they said. The ones looking for Eddie George and Randy 
        Moss seemed to forget that they were absent for a reason. The Super Bowl 
        defenses.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while Raymond James Stadium was packed on January 
        29, the fans weren't watching what they really wanted to see. What took 
        place was a triumph of run-stopping and pass-coverage. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nickels and dimes, stunts and blitzes foiled the deep 
        fades and quick tosses that tend to break games wide open. And whether 
        or not it was a disappointment to those at the game, it should have been 
        a delight to the true football fans.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kerry Collins and Trent Dilfer are not spectacular names 
        and (despite what the Vikings may say) not great players. Tiki Barber 
        and Ron Dayne might have been legends in college, but they aren't enough 
        to support their team even in tandem. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No receiver on the Ravens caught over a hundred balls 
        or gained near a thousand yards, yet they both made it to Tampa. Through 
        defense and defense alone.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the regular season, Baltimore's defense embarrassed 
        opponents; each game they weren't supposed to, but they always did. Allowing 
        an NFL-best 10.3 points-per-game and 60.6 rushing yards will secure your 
        franchise a spot deep in the playoffs- even if you're quarterbacked by 
        Tony Banks and Dilfer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art Modell's five-year old squad's Super Bowl QB threw 
        for a glorious 1500 yards, eight touchdowns, eight interceptions and a 
        76.6 rating. In an era that has been dominated by the scoring game, these 
        numbers belong at home, watching-not playing. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the opposing end, Collins had thrown for 3610 yards, 
        22 touchdowns, and owned an 83.1 rating. But these numbers are tricky, 
        coming against only one playoff team (the Eagles, twice) the entire year. 
        Both quarterbacks played the Phoenix role, restarting their own motors 
        in different cities. Collins dropped out of Carolina after damning his 
        team, and Dilfer was thrown out of Tampa for ruining the Bucs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through their defenses, though, they were they able 
        to land safely on the Super Bowl grass. The final NFL game became a microcosm 
        for what the entire season was: football dominated by linebackers, ends, 
        tackles, and the secondary. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in the second quarter, a series of plays further 
        showed the tone of the game. <i>Jamal Lewis runs for no yards; Lewis drops 
        a pass in the flats. Dilfer throws past Jason Sehorn. Ravens punt. Penalty 
        against New York. Collins almost picked off. Giant first-down. Giant punt.</i> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No offensive continuity was ever started due to the 
        play of both defenses. Ray Lewis and his record-setting corps bottled 
        up the often-used backfield of Barber and fullback Greg Comella until 
        New York changed it.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Dayne came in to supply the feared "Thunder and 
        Lightning" combination, Tony Siragusa and the rest of the Ravens' line 
        closed the gaps before Dayne got the ball. Barber ended the game with 
        a grand total of 49 rushing yards on 11 attempts. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raven defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis established 
        his run-defense so quickly, New York ran only 16 rushing plays all night. 
        This left (Giant offensive coordinator) Sean Payton calling passing plays 
        for a quarterback whose credibility balanced on his NFC Championship game 
        performance. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he did pass for 381 yards and five touchdowns, 
        Collins was more than fazed by the ever-changing formations of the Baltimore 
        defense. He was sacked four times and managed only 112 yards through the 
        air on 15 completions. Along with almost double the amount of wasted passes, 
        he threw four interceptions. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant coach Jim Fassell said, "It was a combination 
        of us not protecting him, which I think made him a little nervous, and 
        then he started forcing things."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side of the ball, it was dead-calm. Brian 
        Billick strolled up and down the side-lines, not worrying about scoring 
        because he knew the Giants wouldn't. Dilfer and rookie running back Jamal 
        Lewis provided the groundwork for an unspectacular yet working offense. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first half, Baltimore receivers victimized cornerback 
        Jason Sehorn repeatedly. He was burned on outs and button-hooks, and then 
        finally on a post pattern by Brandon Stokley, a second-year receiver out 
        of Louisiana-Lafayette, for the first score of the game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This turned out to be the only impact score by an offense. 
        While Jamal Lewis ran for a short touchdown late in the game, and Matt 
        Stover connected on two of three field goals for the Ravens, they didn't 
        affect the outcome of the game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden outburst of scoring that took place in the 
        third-quarter stemmed from spectacular plays, just not from the guy who 
        gets the snap. First, Collins dropped back to throw a simple out-pattern 
        of about five yards. Instead, Duane Starks came in strong from his coverage 
        position and picked the ball off, sprinting 49 yards into the end zone. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ensuing kickoff, rookie kick-returner, Ron Dixon 
        took the ball at his three yard line, broke through the Baltimore special 
        teams and put his team's only points on the scoreboard. This was the same 
        Dixon whose longest return during the regular season was 44 yards and 
        hadn't had a touchdown all year. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had, however, run back the opening kickoff against 
        the Vikings two weeks earlier. While spectators and participants alike 
        reveled in the happenings of the past 14 seconds, Jermaine Lewis juked 
        his way to a touchdown of his own, taking the kickoff back 84 yards. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three SportsCenter clips packed back-to-back-to-back 
        for the <i>playoff</i> football fans allowed all to fill their viewing 
        needs. Forget about them. Though they were heart-stopping, stand up and 
        cheer big plays, they weren't the essence of the game. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you should remember are the countless times Collins 
        hit the grass; Chris McAlister picking off a near-touchdown pass; Ray 
        Lewis almost grabbing an interception- tipping it in order for a teammate 
        to grab the ball. Remember Trent Dilfer running for his career from linebackers 
        Michael Barrow and Jesse Armstead; Michael Strahan demolishing any run 
        to his side of the line.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the end, Baltimore forced its way to a championship. 
        Or rather, they forced everyone else out. They rode an incredible 11-game 
        winning streak to the end of the line with a dominating defensive game 
        that has rarely been seen. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Player of the Year, and Super Bowl MVP, Ray Lewis 
        (rightfully) draws most of the spotlight, the Ravens offense rightfully 
        gets little. For the true football fan, the Ravens exemplify the Football 
        spirit and embody the physical intensity we've been meant to see for years.
