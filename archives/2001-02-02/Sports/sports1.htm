      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, Dayton Arena was the sight of one of the 
        most productive weeks in years for the Bowdoin Women's Ice Hockey Team, 
        as the Polar Bears crushed St. Catherine and Colby by accounts of 4-0 
        and 6-0, respectively, and earned a hard-fought tie against a Middlebury 
        squad that had previously registered 102 straight victories in league 
        play. In the process of doing so, the Lady Polar Bears upped their overall 
        record to 10-2-3.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tie against the Panthers (9-1-1, 9-0-1 ECAC) occurred 
        Friday night at Dayton Arena before a large crowd of fans hoping to witness 
        a small piece of hockey history. Such fans were not disappointed, as the 
        Polar Bears-courtesy of first-year Gillian McDonald and sophomore Ba Lanoue-quickly 
        jumped out to 2-0 advantage during first period play. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Panthers managed to respond with a score just 26 
        seconds into the second period, but sophomore Shelly Chessie had an answer 
        of her own a mere 2:20 later, once again staking the Polar Bears to a 
        two goal lead. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third period, however, featured a series of effective 
        Middlebury attacks, and though Bowdoin sophomore goalie Emily McKissock 
        did an admirable job repelling an increasingly potent Panther attack (in 
        all, she posted 43 saves), Middlebury eventually managed to knot the score 
        at three, with the final tally notched with just 2:11 left in regulation.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday's home contest against St. Catherine (11-6-1) 
        would prove to be far less of a challenge for the well-prepared Polar 
        Bear squad. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the game remained close until the third period-Bowdoin's 
        lone goal up until that point coming from first-year Lindsey Simon-the 
        Polar Bears broke the contest open in the final frame with back-breaking 
        tallies from Chessie, first-year Jen Pelkey , and McDonald. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also playing exceptionally well were sophomore Alyson 
        Lizotte, who had two assists, and sophomore goalie Francesca Klucevek-Whalen, 
        who turned away 25 shots in earning the shutout.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday night, the song remained virtually the 
        same as the Polar Bears dismantled an overmatched Colby (6-6-4) team in 
        non-conference action. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears exploded for three first period goals and 
        never looked back, trouncing the White Mules 6-0. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offensive star for the home squad was Shellie Chessie, 
        who deposited two goals and dished out two assists. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other scorers for Bowdoin included first-year Britney 
        Carr, Lanoue, first-year Jess Burke, and sophomore Leah McClure. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McKissock posted 17 saves to register her second shutout 
        of the season and said, "It felt really great to shut Colby out. They 
        had played well against Middlebury and we didn't know what to expect. 
        Our defense held strong the entire game and the offense kept putting numbers 
        up on the board. It was a key victory."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Polar Bears look to continue their winning ways 
        as they take to the road this weekend, visiting Union College on Saturday 
        and Colgate University this Sunday afternoon. </p>
