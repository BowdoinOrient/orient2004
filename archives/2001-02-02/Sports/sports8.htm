      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's hockey team bounced back from a 6-4 defeat 
        at New England College last Saturday to shut out St. Anselm the next day 
        by a score of 5-0. The mixed results of the weekend were mitigated by 
        some great Bear scoring and some record-breaking from Colin Robinson '01. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears first traveled to Henniker, NH, for a grueling 
        match with the NEC squad on Jan 26. After two periods of back-and-forth 
        scoring, the Bears lost their foothold when NEC scored two quick goals 
        early in the third period. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You have to give them credit," head coach Terry Meagher 
        said. "They had three or four players that were as good as we'll see in 
        the league.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We didn't play as well Friday night," he continued. 
        "We made errors in the game that we hadn't seen for most of the year, 
        and they cost us." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy McNerney '02, Marty Brisebois '04, Adam Mantin 
        '03, and Chris Pelletier '04 all put away goals for the Polar Bears in 
        the 6-4 loss. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The St. Anselm game was a much better day for the men. 
        First-year Chris Pelletier and sophomore Sean Starke cooperated impressively, 
        assisting each other's goals and notching four points apiece in the game. 
        Pelletier netted a hat trick in the first period, assisted each time by 
        Starke. Juniors Mike Carosi and David Rush also contributed to the first 
        set of Bowdoin goals. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagher said that the Pelletier-Starke-Carosi forward 
        line is working quite successfully. "They are playing very well as a unit. 
        We've established a power play set that seems to be working for us."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scoring from other Bears kept Bowdoin ahead later in 
        the game. First-year Brisebois took assists from Mantin and Rush, beating 
        St. Anselm goalie Mike Waugh with about four minutes to play in the second 
        period. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pelletier again made his presence known after 12 minutes 
        had elapsed in the final period. Along with sophomore Jared Porter, he 
        dished an assist to Starke, who scored his sixth goal of the season. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the final 5-0 score, Coach Meagher said that 
        the game wasn't a blowout. "St. A's was playing very well," he said. "They're 
        a good young team, and we were tested and pressured the entire game.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scoring has been an issue for us, but we're getting 
        people stepping forward and getting goals at important times. If you're 
        going to have success, you have to have people on ice that are threats 
        to score," Meagher added.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday was a record-breaking day for senior captain 
        Colin Robinson, who notched his sixth career shutout and 46th career win 
        at St. Anselm. He progressed to the top of the career-shutout list, and 
        will take first place in the career-wins category with two more victories.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's quite an honor for him," Coach Meagher said. "There 
        have been a lot of great goaltenders here at Bowdoin. With the way our 
        team rallied, the focus was on preserving the shutout for him." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team has seven regular-season games remaining, and 
        will face some threatening squads in the coming weeks. </p>
