      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Men's Indoor Track team is off to a fast 
        start, compiling a 23-2 record through the first three meets of the season. 
        Coming off a win over 18 teams in the Brandeis Invitational (1/20), the 
        Bowdoin men's team was ready for a bigger challenge this past Saturday, 
        when it hosted Springfield College - the defending outdoor track New England 
        Division III champion - as well as Tufts University, Middlebury College, 
        and Gordon College.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin men ran, jumped, sprinted and threw gallantly, 
        but despite many strong performances, finished a close second to an excellent 
        Springfield team. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Springfield has a great program, and they were too 
        powerful for us. We stayed with them in some of the event areas, but they 
        had too much quality and depth across their lineup for us," Coach Peter 
        Slovenski said. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the highlights of the meet was Bowdoin's 4x400 
        relay team victory in a time of 3:24.76. The relay team of Brian Laurits 
        '04, Jeff Manganaro '03, Rob Mandle '02, and Phil Webster '04 has the 
        chance tobecome the first sub-3:20 team in the 110-year history of Bowdoin 
        track. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another particularly strong performance was delivered 
        by James Wilkins '04 who remained undefeated in the high jump with a clearing 
        jump of 6'6". Dan Abraham '04 continued to be one of the team's top scorers, 
        competing in the long jump, triple jump and 55m hurdles.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top sprinting performance of the day was Manganaro's 
        55m victory. The middle distance runners fared well with Mandle finishing 
        second in the 600m, Mike Pesa-Fallon '02 finishing third in the 800m and 
        Byron Boots '03 placing second in the 1000m in a time of 2:35.68.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance runners also scored points for the team 
        with Dan Gulotta '03 placing third in the mile and Steve Allison '01 and 
        Pat Vardaro '03 placing first and third, respectively, in the 3000m.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin was second in the New England III Indoor Track 
        and Field Championship last year led by a trio of talented seniors - Chris 
        Downe, Scott Schilling and Josh Helfat. "After losing the seniors we had 
        last year, it would be amazing to get back among the top two teams in 
        New England III. We are not as good in some events, but we're better in 
        others. Our top three scorers after three meets are all freshmen," said 
        Coach Slovenski.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Steve Allison credits much of the early season's 
        success to good contributions from every class. "Confidence is high; excitement 
        is high; and everyone in every event is glad to be doing what they're 
        doing. This team embodies the best aspects of the word 'team'."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Saturday, the Bowdoin Men's Indoor Track team travels 
        to Connecticut to take on Coast Guard, followed by the Maine State Meet 
        at Bates College next Saturday. </p>
