      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past Saturday the Bears saw their three game winning 
        streak come to an end with a 70-55 loss at Williams. An uncharacteristically 
        poor shooting night led to the defeat as Bowdoin shot only 40 percent 
        in the second half, turning a close half-time score into the eventual 
        15 point deficit. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a rare lapse for the team, which leads the NESCAC 
        in field goal percentage, draining nearly half of its shots at a 48.6 
        percent clip. Williams was led by Tim Folan, who dropped in seven shots 
        from beyond the arc. The Eph's had ten three-pointers on the night, which 
        would prove to be too much for the Bears. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowdoin was led by senior David Baranowski who sported 
        a double-double with 18 points and 13 boards. Speaking of Baranowski and 
        field-goal percentage, he leads not only the NESCAC but the nation as 
        well with a 68.8 percent rating.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, last week was a good one for the Bears as they 
        picked up victories over St. Joseph's (Maine) and Middlebury before falling 
        to Williams. For the second straight year Bowdoin eked one out at Middlebury 
        winning 75-74. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baranowski led the way in that game as well, putting 
        up 22 points as the Bears shot 54 percent on the night. At St. Joe's the 
        Bears led the whole with three players in double figures as they knocked 
        off the Monks for the third straight meeting. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The week capped off a torrid January for the Bears, 
        which saw them go on win streaks of three and four games. They went 7-3 
        on the month as they pushed their record to 12-5 overall and 2-2 in the 
        NESCAC. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the seven victories came in overtime against 
        Connecticut College who had been a preseason favorite. That game saw many 
        lead changes and several runs before Steve McKinnon '01 hit two free-throws 
        to ice it at 83-79. Bowdoin also defeated Colby-Sawyer, Plymouth State, 
        Maine-Farmington, and Colby in January. The other two losses came at Babson 
        and Wesleyan.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, the first official NESCAC season of Basketball 
        complete with playoffs and a conference champion, Bowdoin is looking strong 
        so far. The team has already topped its victory total from last year when 
        it went 11-13. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last season saw the Bears start out strong before stumbling 
        down the stretch. Hopefully Bowdoin will maintain this high level of play 
        and keep me busy in front of a keyboard late into February.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bears have six games remaining, five of them conference 
        match-ups, which carry greater significance this season with the playoffs 
        looming. Senior captain Greg Lovely said, "I like our chances (to make 
        the playoffs). We already beat Connecticut College who was one of the 
        favorites. If we play the way we're capable of, I know we'll do well." 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team will remain on the road for the next couple 
        of weeks playing at Bates tonight and at Tufts tomorrow, before traveling 
        to Farmington and Colby next week, and finally returning home to finish 
        up with games against Amherst and Trinity on February 16 and 17. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope everyone waits in breathless anticipation for 
        next week's article considering that you can't see your beloved Bears 
        play for several more weeks. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the basketball team is on the road get out 
        and support some of the other squads playing on campus this weekend. Don't 
        miss one of the best hockey weekends of the season as Middlebury and Norwich 
        come to Dayton for games Friday and Saturday respectfully. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let me just say that its good to be back and until 
        next week as always, Go U Bears!! </p>
