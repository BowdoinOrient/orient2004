      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday, the University of Maine at Waterville 
        met Bowdoin at the Leroy Greason pool for their annual duel meet. Although 
        both men's and women's teams lost to the White Mules, they demonstrated 
        outstanding sportsmanship and continued to improve drastically. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men's meet began with a 1-2 finish in the 200 yard 
        medley relay. The first place team was composed of Andrew D. Shaw '02, 
        Nicholas Driskill '02, Dean Anson '03, and Elliot Dickson '02, in a time 
        of 1:41.09. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following closely behind in second was the 'B' team, 
        with Matthew Hammond '02, Michael Alan Long '04, Henry Bangert '01, and 
        William B. Thomas '03, in a time of 1:44.60. Matthew Byrne '02 scored 
        a second place finish in the 1000 yard freestyle in 11:31.80, with John 
        David Clifford V '02 following in fourth (12:25.54). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captain Andy Shaw said, "I think Colby beat us because 
        they have a bigger team and more depth; but in all the races, we consistently 
        swam better than they did."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 200 yard freestyle Dave Harden '03 and Thomas 
        were third and fourth, respectively, with times of 1:55.87 and 1:59.29. 
        Teammate Josh Kingsbury '03 also placed sixth in the 200 free with a time 
        of 2:11.83. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaw won both backstroke events; swimming the 100 in 
        0:58.46 seconds and the 200 in 2:06.88. Driskill won the 100 yard breastroke 
        in 1:00.00 (that's really hard to do, by the way...getting all zeros), 
        with senior Bangert scoring fourth in 1:08.89. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robie Anson put forth a gutsy performance in the 200 
        yard butterfly (one of the two most awful events to exist in the sport), 
        winning in a time of 2:07.14. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three Polar Bears scored in the 50 free, with Mike Long 
        in second (22.61), Elliot Dickson in third (22.75), and Todd Williams 
        in sixth (24.75). Dickson then hopped back in the pool to swim the 100 
        free, finishing in second with a time of :49.33 seconds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driskill took second in the 200 breastroke in 2:15.40,while 
        Anson and Bangert returned to the butterfly events, taking second and 
        fourth respectively in the 100, with times of :54.34 and 1:00.47. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finishing the individual events with the 200 IM, Andy 
        Shaw and Dave Harden took second and fourth, in 2:14.37 and 2:17.38. The 
        last relay was an exciting one; the 'A' team of Mike Long, Elliot Dickson, 
        Will Thomas, and Nick Driskill won the 200 free relay in a sick time of 
        1:30.75, by only.07 seconds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Driskill stated, "I just want to drop below a minute 
        (in the 100m breaststroke)…to reassure myself I can get to nationals again. 
        Hopefully our 200 medley relay will make it to nationals; we have a really 
        good change. I don't think we've lost yet this season."<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women's team also showed immense improvement in 
        their events. The 'A' and 'B' 200 medley relay teams scored second and 
        third with times of 1:59.49 and 2:00.98. Swimming for the 'A' team were 
        captain Catherine Williams '01, Liz Buell '02, Jenny Mendelson '01, and 
        Anna Podore '03. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming for the 'B' team were Lauren McNally '03, Allison 
        Benton '03, Kiele Mauricio '04, and Kara Podkaminer '03. Team distance 
        continued to drop time in the 1000 yard freestyle, with Mauricio finishing 
        third in a time of 12:09.98 and Annie Blair close behind in fourth with 
        a time of 12:13.32. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Podkaminer won the 200 freestyle in 2:05.98, while Williams 
        and McNally went 1-2 in the 100 backstroke with respective times of 1:03.61 
        and 1:05.12. Bowdoin took third, fourth, and fifth places in the 50 freestyle, 
        with Podore finishing in 26.54 seconds, Gillian Stevens '04 in 26.83 seconds, 
        and Mendelson in 27.04 seconds. Podkaminer continued to show her dominance 
        in the sprint freestyle events with a second place finish in the 100 freestyle, 
        57.58 seconds. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams and McNally went 2-3 in the 200 backstroke, 
        in 2:18.23 and 2:23.38. The Bears picked up some points with the 200 breastroke; 
        Allison Benton claimed third in 2:45.38, Jenn Scangos '04 was fourth in 
        2:46.74, and Sarah Hoenig '02 followed up with sixth in 2:54.27. Three 
        swimmers also gained points in the 100 butterfly with Audrey Gray '02 
        in third with 1:09.95, Amy Tow '04 in fourth with 1:10.49, and Meghan 
        Gregory '01 in sixth with 1:15.71. The 200 IM was the last individual 
        event, with McNally placing second in 2:24.88 and Alex DeRubira '04 placing 
        fifth in 2:40.00. The women wrapped up their meet with second and third 
        place finishes in the 200 free relay. The 'A' team, with Williams, Podkaminer, 
        Podore and Mendelson, swam a time of 1:45.78, and the 'B' team (Buell, 
        Blair, Gray and Stevens) swam a 1:53.47. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team hosts the final meet of the season here at 
        home on Saturday against Trinity and Wesleyan, starting at 11 a.m. Come 
        out to the field house and show your support for the Bowdoin swim team 
        in their last seasonal meet! </p>
