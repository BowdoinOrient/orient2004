      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last weekend, on Super Bowl Sunday, Bowdoin Women's 
        Squash Team was nipped by Brown University. Brown has been a powerhouse 
        in collegiate squash since, "Well, really as long as I have been born," 
        says junior Leila Mountain, just back from Australia. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After waking early and enduring a four-hour bus ride, 
        the team was mentally ready but physically a little cramped. Dana Betts 
        '01, Liz Steffey '01, Merril Muckerman '03, and Whitney Hodgkins '03 all 
        came out with wins while Anne Stevenson '01, Kate Lubin '01, Mountain, 
        Stanely, and Cristin O'Brien '02 held on tightly but just barely lost.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final score was 5-4, which was much more exciting 
        and closer than other games that went on that day. The effort that everyone 
        put in at the Brown match was not less that 100 percent; however, Brown 
        outplayed Bowdoin's valiant effort. The closeness of this match is going 
        to play a huge role in the women's national ranking. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The team is hoping to make the top eight which will 
        put it in the A division for team nationals (this is the country's top 
        division). On Saturday, the match against Cornell will also play a huge 
        role in Bowdoin's national rankings, so come out and cheer the girls on. 
        And please, don't be afraid to ask anyone of us about the rules and regulations. 
        We love this game and would love to share it with you.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you grasp what is going on in those boxes, the 
        game is quite enthralling. "It's like boxing without contact," says Mountain, 
        as she mimics an Ali uppercut. It is about footwork, delivery, and mental 
        toughness; so come out and see how these girls prove to be some of the 
        nation's most dynamic athletes. </p>
