      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bowdoin Women's Basketball Team, after a seven-game 
        winning streak, has improved its record to a stellar 12-4. After a slow 
        start during winter break, the team rallied to pick up some crucial wins: 
        Colby-Sawyer, Colby, Wesleyan, Connecticut College, Bates, Middlebury, 
        and Williams. Along the way, Kristi Royer '03 earned honors as NESCAC 
        Player of the Week and Lora Trenkle '04 was awarded Rookie of the Week 
        status for the state of Maine. Royer comments on the team's standing, 
        as tournament time approaches: "We've put in a lot of hard work and have 
        generated a great deal of momentum; we are hoping to keep that momentum 
        through the remainder of our season." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Saturday's win over Williams demonstrated the team's 
        true potential. In their first-ever win over Williams, the Lady Polar 
        Bears came from behind to win 71-65. Leading the charge was Trenkle, who 
        scored 17 points. Royer chipped in 13 points and 10 rebounds. Other scorers 
        included Courtney Trotta '04, with 9 points, Kristina Fugate '04 with 
        7 points, Jessie Mayol '02 with 5 points, Nicole Fava '03 with 8 points, 
        Lindsey Bramwell '04 with 6 points, Jamie Bennett '01 with 4 points, and 
        Lauren Myers '01 with 2 points. Trotta and Mayol also contributed three 
        assists each. This victory was the Polar Bears' 7th straight; they head 
        into this weekend looking to pick up two more tallies for the win column. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This weekend, the team will take on two NESCAC teams, 
        Bates and Tufts. Basketball fans are in luck; both games will be played 
        at home! The weekend will begin with a 7:00 p.m.face-off Friday against 
        Bates and will culminate with a 3:00 p.m. Saturday game against Tufts. 
        As the team enters the season's final stretch, the players have demonstrated 
        their ability to come together and are starting to realize their full 
        potential; this is pay-off time. <br>
