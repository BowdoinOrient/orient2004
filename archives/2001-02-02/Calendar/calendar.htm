            The topic of this colloquium is Education, and President Edwards will 
            be chatting with principals from two Maine schools. Sounds like an 
            excellent colloquium. I really love the word colloquium. I should 
            really use it more in everday conversation. Lancaster Lounge, Moulton 
            Union. </font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">

            Ben Harper is playing at Bates. I hear that we had him first, but 
            due to some conflict we couldn't hold on to him, so the concert is 
            now at Bates. Not like it's a big deal, Bates is almost in our back 
            yard. Somewhere at Bates.</font><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">
