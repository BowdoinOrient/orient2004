        greets Dudley Coe turnover</b></font><!-- #EndEditable --></b></font></p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new era in Dudley Coe is emerging, despite the controversy 
        and suspicion that has surrounded the transition. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Robin Beltramini, the director of the health 
        center for fourteen years, was terminated, which began a series of resignations 
        and reorganizations. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the air of secrecy that students have sensed 
        regarding the change, Dr. Jeff Benson, the new director of health services, 
        was eager to dispel some of the persisting rumors and concerns.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wanted to be more pro-active in responding to the 
        issues…I'm well aware of the controversy related to Dudley Coe right now," 
        he stated. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He first addressed the problems with the prior way that 
        the center was run, noting that students would be thoroughly examined 
        by nurses, but could not be treated due to the limited legal qualifications 
        of the R.N.s. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students then would have to wait again to see a physician's 
        assistant or doctor. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The previous nurses could function as P.A.s without 
        actually having had a license, but this was legally and liability-wise 
        risky for patients," he explained. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new structure had to be implemented that allowed the 
        students to be seen and treated in one visit, and this could be better 
        accomplished with a staff composed of more middle and upper-level care 
        providers. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The reputation of a college health facility is basically 
        to treat sore throats and runny noses, but that's not my idea at all. 
        Students can have complicated medical needs," said Benson. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To accommodate more P.A.s on the staff, the two former 
        R.N. positions had to be consolidated and reconfigured to encompass more 
        administrative work than before. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We felt it would be unfair to simply appoint one nurse 
        and turn down the other," he said, referring to former Dudley Coe nurses 
        Joan Mitchell and Mary Ann Boulos-Lord. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We strongly encouraged them to apply for the position, 
        but neither chose to." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acknowledging that the employees were favorites among 
        the students, Benson noted that they were "wonderful care providers and 
        had a great rapport with students." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson also commented on the departure of Beltramini: 
        "She's a great clinician and person. It's unfortunate that her leaving 
        ties into such an emotional climate." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Evelyn Scaramella echoed this sentiment and recalled 
        her devotion to students. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She was so active in campus life and women's issues, 
        and people felt really strongly about her presence on campus," she said. 
        Scaramella added that "[her dismissal] was a huge shock and [was] very 
        disappointing to many people." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson responded to allegations of the uncanny timing 
        of her departure on the last day of finals, explaining that there were 
        many factors involved with the postponement of the transition, but it 
        had more to do with the college budgeting policies than anything else. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the transition has been difficult at times, Benson 
        said he is hopeful that the students will respond to the new staff, which 
        he described as "extremely approachable." He hoped that the open house 
        held Thursday would give students an opportunity to meet the new staff 
        and open up the doors to a more accessible and interactive health center. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the goals for the future of the health center, 
        he stressed the importance of increased health education and prevention. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benson was enthusiastic about ways that Dudley Coe could 
        reach out more into the college community, suggesting collaboration with 
        Res Life, health fairs, and even class teaching. He primarily focused 
        on giving the center more of an opportunity to respond to student suggestions 
        and needs. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're working hard to pull the center together and 
        redesign it. We're also working hard to earn the interest and trust of 
        students," Benson said. </p>
