      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several months of work, consultants from the 
        independent firm of Woodard and Curran recently released the results of 
        an environmental audit of the College which included two visits to Bowdoin-one 
        last summer and one in September. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary goal of the audit was to "detail the current 
        environmental impact to air, water, and land from all of Bowdoin's activities 
        and operations." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The audit addressed recycling, solid waste, energy, 
        water, hazardous waste, transportation, construction, landscaping, and 
        purchasing. The report presents general recommendations for each issue, 
        as well as recommendations to 25 College areas, ranging from the Department 
        of Athletics to the Breckinridge Center. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Bowdoin's problems, according to the audit, is 
        that the recycling facilities at the College are inadequate in both the 
        residences and in many public areas. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, students have often expressed concern for the 
        energy wasted in the residences as many students feel that they must keep 
        their windows open in order to moderate the often extreme heat. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is that electricity consumption has increased 
        a dramatic 75 percent since 1995, partly due to the proliferation of personal 
        computers and electronics.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the audit did recognize some actions that Bowdoin 
        has taken to reduce its environmental impact. For example, energy conservation 
        measures have reduced oil use at the heating plant by about 20 percent 
        since 1973, despite the large growth of the campus. This amounts to a 
        per-building-area decrease of 40 percent. Also, dining service's simple 
        action of placing napkin baskets on the tables has reduced napkin waste 
        by 40 percent. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee for a Sustainable Bowdoin, who recommended 
        the hiring of Woodard and Curran, is responsible for helping to carry 
        out the recommendations of the audit. As a result, it now has three significant 
        goals on its agenda.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to tackle the "low-hanging fruit." These 
        are easy and inexpensive actions, such as placing napkin holders on tables 
        and setting computers to go to sleep sooner. The other two actions are 
        more difficult, but will yield greater results. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Bowdoin has recognized the need for an environmental 
        coordinator and is conducting a search to fill that position. The coordinator 
        will work with faculty, students, and staff to make the improvements recommended 
        by the audit and to provide assistance to the administration regarding 
        environmental issues. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the committee plans to develop awareness training, 
        which is intended to inform faculty, staff, and students about environmental 
        issues. </p>
