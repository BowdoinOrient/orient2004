      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who make Hawthorne-Longfellow Library their 
        second home, missing ceilings and make-shift walls are nothing out of 
        the ordinary. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, new lighting is being installed in the first 
        floor and the basement, and all of the furnishings are awaiting either 
        refinishing, reupholstering, or replacement. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A room for public events that will be open to the larger 
        community, called the Poetry Reading Room, has also been added to the 
        first floor and features a data projector. By the completion of the renovations 
        in September, two small-group study lounges will be completed on the third 
        floor of the library, and one large-group study lounge will be accessible 
        to students in the basement.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To permit renovations on the third floor, Special Collections 
        and Archives has moved to temporary quarters in the south portion of the 
        first floor, and some third floor collections in government, law, and 
        education will temporarily be relocated elsewhere on the third floor.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help brighten the temporary construction 
        partitions in the reference area, the library will host a painting party 
        and an open house next Wednesday, February 7 to work on a mural designed 
        by 26 students enrolled in Professor Wethli's Painting I class.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painting begins at 9:00 a.m. and will continue until 
        4:00 p.m. From 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., library staff will be on hand to 
        show plans and color boards for the renovation project, give tours of 
        some completed staff spaces, and to answer any questions or listen to 
        any comments. Refreshments will also be served.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the physical aspects of the renovations, 
        the library is also planning to improve the technological side of the 
        library. These improvements will provide more and faster computer connections 
        in the library, and the Electronic Classroom will expand its number of 
        computer terminals from 16 to 24. As Librarian Sherrie Bergman pointed 
        out, the facility will then be open to 50-person classes if students double 
        up. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the student study lounges will also be wired, 
        and wireless devices are also being installed this summer to enable students 
        to use laptops in more areas beginning this fall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the library has also updated its internet 
        gateway, which was redesigned to provide quick and easy access to heavily 
        used services such as the library catalog, reserves, course and research 
        guides, and an array of digital indices, databases, and e-texts. Also, 
        CBB students are now able to participate in the Maine Info Net, a new, 
        state-funded cooperative program which provides a merged catalog of over 
        two million items owned by libraries throughout Maine.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Instructional Media Services is expanding its 
        inventory of equipment available to faculty, students, and staff for short-term 
        loan. New mini-DV video cameras, microphone kits, and digital still cameras 
        are available from the Language Media Center; circulation is for 24 hours 
        with up to two renewals, and instruction is provided.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these changes, library hours were also 
        changed last semester in response to student concerns voiced by the Student 
        Executive Board. The library hours in both Hawthorne-Longfellow Library 
        and Hatch Science Library were expanded for an additional hour, until 
        1:00 a.m., on Sunday through Wednesday nights. However, the libraries 
        close an hour earlier on Friday and Saturday nights-11:00 p.m. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The popularity of these changes in hours guarantees 
        that the longer hours, which started out on a trial basis, will become 
        permanent.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accommodate renovations, Hawthorne-Longfellow 
        Library will be closed for both of the Mondays and Fridays during spring 
        break. This will allow construction crews to start the extensive construction 
        work to be completed during the summer. However, library staff will be 
        in place and can be reached by phone during these four days if students 
        have an urgent need for specific materials. </p>
