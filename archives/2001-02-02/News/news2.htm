      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nine-year-old California murder case was recently 
        solved with the arrest of a local Brunswick woman who worked at The Thai 
        Place, a restaurant located on Pleasant Street.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty-seven-year-old Sawan Navarat was arrested in connection 
        with the murder of 40-year-old Opapin Ponvisutrakul in Flagstaff, Arizona, 
        on January 21 after having fled from Brunswick.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to California authorities, Navarat shot Ponvisutrakul 
        four times in the head after a heated argument in Los Angeles in 1991 
        in which Navarat accused Ponvisutrakul of being her husband's mistress. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hours after Navarat's arrest in Flagstaff, 42-year-old 
        Warin Toemphanthunan was arrested by Brunswick police and charged with 
        aiding Navarat's escape. If convicted, she could be sentenced to five 
        years in prison, as well as a $250,000 fine.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the murder occurred in 1991, Los Angeles authorities 
        were unable to find Navarat. The file remained open for nine years until 
        an unknown source contacted Detective Michael Crowley of the Bureau of 
        Homicide of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This information led authorities to Portland where, 
        on December 12, police infiltrated a Thai restaurant in the city and arrested 
        a woman who resembled Navarat. However, she was soon released after her 
        fingerprint patterns did not match those of Navarat.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By another anonymous tip, authorities then went to The 
        Thai Place, on 136 Pleasant Street, to question Navarat. However, she 
        had fled by the time they had arrived. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While police questioned patrons in the restaurant about 
        Navarat, Toemphanthunan arrived. She claimed not to know who Navarat was, 
        but authorities soon found out that they had been roommates for years. 
        During her interrogation, Toemphanthunan revealed that she had helped 
        Navarat escape Brunswick just minutes before. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navarat then hitchhiked to Flagstaff, Arizona, where 
        she took a job as a waitress in a Thai restaurant before authorities finally 
        caught up with her. Local merchants were stunned by this development. 
        In her five years in Brunswick, she had gained a reputation as a dependable, 
        but somewhat withdrawn, person. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an interview with <i>Times-Record</i> writer Christopher 
        Cousins on December 15, 2000, Tom Bouthot, owner of Uncle Tom's Market, 
        expressed his shock at Navarat's arrest: "I never would have dreamed she 
        was capable of something like that…[she was] sweet and soft-spoken." <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Portland and California police considered her armed 
        and dangerous. Navarat will be tried in California for her crimes. If 
        convicted, she could face life imprisonment. </p>
