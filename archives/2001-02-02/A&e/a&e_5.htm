      <p>&nbsp; Next Thursday, February 8, the very highly-acclaimed Ben Harper 
        and the Innocent Criminals are performing in the Clifton Daggett Grey 
        Athletic building at Bates. As far as I can tell, this present tour is 
        in further support of his most recent album, "Burn To Shine," which came 
        out in 1999. <br>
        &nbsp; Some of you may still remember the song "Steal my Kisses," which, 
        as I recall, got a fair amount of radio time this past summer. Some of 
        you may still have it stuck in your heads.<br>
        &nbsp; For those of you who haven't heard anything else on Harper's latest 
        album but still have a hankering to get off campus on Thursday night and 
        see what will certainly be an incredible performance, don't expect him 
        to stick exclusively to the cheerfully chill acoustic vibe that rings 
        so clearly throughout "Steal my Kisses." While his performance will certainly 
        be intimate, and will certainly be more laid back than your average rock 
        show, Harper's versatility and wide range of influences are his most signature 
        traits.<br>
        &nbsp; The influences on "Burn to Shine" range everywhere from soulful 
        songwriting to straight-ahead rock, from poppy bass grooves to melancholy 
        guitar-and-voice songs, from the politically active to the emotionally 
        stimulating. <br>
        &nbsp; Whatever his influences, though, you can certainly count on Harper 
        to give a great show. Says his official website: "You will never forget 
        the experience of Ben Harper live in concert." He began performing at 
        the age of sixteen at various blues clubs around his native Claremont, 
        CA and mesmerized his audiences with the emotional intensity of his playing. 
        He quickly made a name for himself and at the age of 24 signed with Virgin 
        Records, who now proudly sponsors his website. <br>
        &nbsp; For the first few years of Harper's touring career, his performances 
        were made up of Ben and his acoustic guitar, an instrumentation and intimate 
        setting that drove fans everywhere he went absolutely wild. His popularity 
        steadily grew, and on a tour in support of his album "Fight for Your Mind" 
        introduced his band, the Innocent Criminals, with whom he has been playing 
        ever since.<br>
        &nbsp; Unfortunately, last time I checked at the Smith Union Info desk, 
        there weren't any tickets left for this event. But I vaguely recall them 
        saying something about ordering more, so if you can, get down to the Union 
        today between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. and pick some up. This is definitely 
        something you don't want to miss.</p>
