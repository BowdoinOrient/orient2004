      <p>&nbsp; I have a confession to make. I have been going out of my way to 
        rent bad movies for this column each and every week. That's right, I know 
        before hand that these movies will be bad. I have been continuously judging 
        videos by their cover, if you will, and I have consistently been proving 
        myself right. Don't think for a second that I might actually think that 
        Leprechaun in the Hood might be a fine film, worthy of further investigation. 
        Quite the contrary, I'm banking on it being awful. Why do I subject myself 
        to such torture each week, you may ask? For you. As Brian Adams would 
        say, "Everything I do, I do it for you." By renting low budget pieces 
        of crap, and simply re-telling their ludicrous plot, I can make you laugh. 
        Cheap laughs.<br>
        &nbsp; But it makes me happy. Is this fine writing or probing criticism? 
        I think not. So, I'm going to try something a little different this week. 
        I'm going to review a film that I suspected was good and that I've actually 
        been wanting to see. I am still staying within my format, since this film 
        was a straight to video release, and yes there are a few decent direct 
        to video releases out there, although quite seldom. <br>
        &nbsp; But do not worry, this new approach is for this week and this week 
        only. To ensure I do not lose some of my beloved audience I offer a brief 
        preview of next week's film: It is called Whatever It Takes, and stars 
        Andrew Dice Clay as an undercover detective investigating steroid use 
        in the seedy world of female body-building. When you combine two such 
        revolting subjects, like Andrew Dice Clay and female body-builders, well, 
        we know we are dealing with something really special. <br>
        &nbsp; The "good" film in question for this week is Dune, a new adaptation 
        of Frank Herbert's brilliant science-fiction masterpiece. If you can't 
        tell, I really liked the book. Some fifteen or so years ago, director 
        David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks) made a huge-budget big screen motion 
        picture of the book. It sucked. While visually interesting, the story 
        was impossible to follow, and anyone who hadn't read the book was pretty 
        much left in the dark. And it starred Sting. <br>
        &nbsp; When I heard about the new version of Dune, I was pretty intrigued. 
        The film premiered on the Sci-Fi Channel (which helped fund the movie, 
        thus increasing its budget) some months back and was fairly well received. 
        But who watches the Sci-Fi Channel? Dorks with cable who have read the 
        book (like myself, but without the cable), and what do they know? Now 
        that Dune is out on tape, I had to see if it was any good.<br>
        &nbsp; The answer is no, it was not good. It was somewhat decent. By direct-to-video 
        standards, it's incredible. But, unfortunately, in order to fully understand 
        what's going on, you need to have read the book. The acting is stiff and 
        unemotional, save a scant few characters, and the special effects are 
        mediocre. Lastly, IT'S FOUR AND A HALF HOURS LONG. Best of all, because 
        it is straight to video, Artisan Entertainment is too cheap to put it 
        on two tapes. Instead, the tape is on ridiculously long mode, which lends 
        for piss-poor picture quality. <br>
        &nbsp; The long running time is a plus for fans of the book, but for the 
        average Joe, it's a big turn off. So what's Dune all about? Well here 
        is a "brief" synopsis. The story takes place in another galaxy, and in 
        this galaxy there is an emperor who presides over several ruling families, 
        each with their own planet to control. <br>
        &nbsp; Two of the families are at war with each other, the Atredies (good 
        guys) and the Harkonens (very bad guys). The Atredies have been kicked 
        off their planet by the emperor and been reassigned to rule the desert 
        world of Arrakis, otherwise known as Dune. Little do the Atredies know, 
        the Harkonens (with the help of the emperor) have set a trap in order 
        to kill off their family line and take control of the planet. <br>
        &nbsp; I must add that the planet itself is incredibly important, since 
        it is the sole source of spice within the galaxy. Spice is an addictive 
        drug, which gives vision and clairvoyance to everyone in the galaxy. Once 
        the trap is in motion, the Duke of the Atredies (William Hurt) is captured 
        and killed, but his concubine and son escape into the wilds of the desert. 
        They are soon taken in by the hardened religious tribes of Dune's native 
        people, the freemen. <br>
        &nbsp; Under the influence of the spice drug, the Duke's son fulfils his 
        destiny (which is built up throughout the entire story in the form of 
        dreams and visions) to become the Messiah of the freemen, leading them 
        to revolution and war.The story is far more complex than just that, and 
        spans the course of a few years. Where the film really falls short is 
        the lack of emotion in most of its key characters, as well as its many 
        straight-forward camera angles, which gives the majority of the production 
        the feel of a stage play. Lines like, "This vast organization we call 
        humanity is about to reinvent itself from the ashes of its own complacency" 
        don't read well in monotone.<br>
        &nbsp; David Lynch's rendition really has the upper hand when it comes 
        to the environment and mood of the story, as well as the casting. I really 
        missed Kyle McLoughlin, who portrayed Paul Mau'dib, son of the Duke, with 
        dark creepiness that was so appropriate for his transformation. The guy 
        who plays Paul in this version remains flat throughout the whole film. 
        In terms of faithfulness to the original story, this new version comes 
        through fairly well.<br>
        &nbsp; The real shame here is that Dune was not picked up for a major 
        theatrical release, due to its long running time, which in turn killed 
        the budget for good actors and special effects. If the average movie-going 
        public had attention spans slightly longer than that of a gnat, Dune may 
        have had a chance. With that said, the straight-to-video release of Dune 
        is incredibly ambitious, although I would only recommend it to fans of 
        the book. If any of you are intrigued by any of this, read the book. The 
        final word: Dune gets a B-.</p>
