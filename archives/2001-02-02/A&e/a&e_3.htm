      <p>&nbsp; You will sometimes hear Bowdoin students comment on-or complain 
        about-the apparent lack of interesting things to see and do here in coastal 
        Maine. Whether this want for stimulating activity is real or imaginary, 
        it always seems to intensify in the winter months. <br>
        &nbsp; Something about the biting cold and iron-gray skies of early February 
        sets a semi-permanent grimace on the faces of about half the student population, 
        making conversation difficult and finding something to do almost impossible. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Fortunately for those still searching, there is Common Hour. While 
        the logic in taking yet another hour of the week to simply sit and listen 
        to someone speak may not be clear, what is perfectly understandable is 
        the desire of many students to hear engaging and provocative ideas from 
        some of the country's most influential figures. It may also be difficult 
        to believe that such important people would travel to coastal Maine to 
        speak to a crowd of liberal-arts-college students, yet still they come. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; In what is sure to be one of the most well-attended and fascinating 
        events of the semester, this week's Common Hour will be a talk given by 
        Angela Y. Davis. Davis is currently a professor of History of Consciousness 
        at the University of California at Santa Cruz, and has been recently appointed 
        the Presidential Chair in African-American and Feminist Studies there. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; As well as a full tenured professorship at UC Santa Cruz, Davis 
        is the author of many articles and several books, including Women, Culture 
        and Politics, Women, Race and Class, and Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, and 
        Billie Holiday: Black Women's Music and the Shaping of Social Consciousness. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; However, Davis is first and foremost an activist for social change. 
        She was a member of the Black Panther party in the 1970's, and has continued 
        to agitate for political and social reform ever since.<br>
        &nbsp; She is the co-founder of the National Alliance Against Racist and 
        Political Repression, and has campaigned ceaselessly for reform in the 
        criminal justice system as well as for the rights of prisoners. She has 
        lectured in such places as Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, and the former 
        Soviet Union. <br>
        &nbsp; Since joining the faculty at UCSC, Davis has become involved with 
        the Women of Color Research Cluster, through which she has organized research 
        projects, a lecture series, and produced a film about women of color. 
        She has attended Brandeis University, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe University 
        in Frankfurt, Germany, and UC San Diego, and has taught at Stanford and 
        the Claremont colleges. Her talk this Friday (12:30 p.m. in Pickard, tickets 
        at Smith Union) is entitled "Black Disenfranchisement and the Prison Industrial 
        Complex." <br>
        &nbsp; From another perspective in the political world comes a second 
        high-profile speaker for Common Hour on February 16th. George F. Will, 
        winner of the Pulitzer Prize in journalism and erudite news analyst, will 
        give a talk in Morrell Lounge entitled "Public Affairs, Public Policy 
        and American Society." As the author of the popular book Men at Work, 
        Will has been providing cogent political analysis for years through articles 
        and television as well. <br>
        &nbsp; This semester, Common Hour was launched with a wonderfully presented 
        and even multi-media talk by Professor Nancy Jennings of the education 
        department. Her discussion of how engaging academic environments are fostered 
        elicited many insightful comments from students and faculty. As an added 
        bonus, Professor Jennings showed footage of elementary school classrooms 
        in action, which served the dual purpose of augmenting her message and 
        lending a surprisingly humorous tone to the talk. So while the weather 
        and workload might appear to dampen intellectual curiosity during these 
        dark winter months, there are still plenty of opportunities to get out 
        and learn. </p>
