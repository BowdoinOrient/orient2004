      <p>&nbsp; Oh, Reality TV. This phenomenon, simultaneously revolting and 
        addicting, has taken over 5A. I always think that I can rest on my morals 
        and principles and abstain when they come on, but then I hear "6 people, 
        picked to live in a house/island/bed" and I go running to the common room. 
        I literally allow myself sit on my couch for an hour muttering such intellectual 
        commentary to myself as "Oooh, Kelly, busted."<br>
        &nbsp; I can't even begin to make a rational or reasonable case for why 
        I do this to myself. They are not good shows. In fact sometimes the show 
        will just get so bad that you think you can't possibly watch anymore, 
        because, well, you hate it. But at that moment, suddenly your enjoyment 
        isn't even a factor anymore. You are rooted to the couch by some transcendent, 
        all-powerful force. You are hating it on the one hand, but on the other 
        hand needing it. <br>
        &nbsp; On the Real World, that damn Mormon, Julie, might be in tears again, 
        and yet somehow, something binds me to my seat while I watch her ridiculous 
        sniveling for 20 minutes. Julie, did you perhaps consider that your parents 
        wouldn't be "psyched" or say "pumped" for you to drop out of Brigham Young 
        to live in a house of sin for 3 months? Perhaps I keep watching out of 
        pure amazement. <br>
        &nbsp; But no, there is something else that makes me wait out episode 
        after episode of what can only be termed as trash. This force is an elusive 
        one though. I still cannot pin it down. <br>
        &nbsp; This evening, for example, Temptation Island, a show that is undeniably, 
        unashamedly, about (now you're expecting something like "sex" or "seduction" 
        but no no, it's about..) ho's. The Premise: Who will be a bigger ho, you 
        or your boyfriend? The Plot: Which ho will Taheed pick tonight? The Twist: 
        Will Billy be a ho to get back at Mandy for being a ho? These kinds of 
        questions involving the word "ho" could go on forever. Why? Because the 
        show is about hos. But I still watch it. Can't do anything about it. <br>
        &nbsp; However, unlike many, I will not sit up on my high horse and preach 
        about the moral degradation of society that these shows perpetuate. I 
        wouldn't say they teach anything "beneficial", per se, but man are they 
        entertaining. My roommates and I get all psyched up for complete awfulness 
        involving secrets and scandal, recounting the highlights of the last week's 
        show. <br>
        &nbsp; We will have worked ourselves into a state of palpable anticipation, 
        when inevitably, in walks That Boy who has to go off about how awful the 
        show is. For now we'll call our hypothetical boy Pavid Mutchinson. Pavid 
        will stand in the doorway, smugly, shaking his head, mocking us for even 
        considering Temptation Island as a viewing option. <br>
        &nbsp; Then Smug Pavid will proceed with his tirade, Maxim in hand of 
        course, while making his way slowly into the room. What, Pavid, may I 
        ask are you doing if you indeed despise this show? Surveying our drapes? 
        Inspecting the indirect lighting arrangement? No! <br>
        &nbsp; You are trying to position yourself better in the room so that 
        you have no other choice but to look in the direction of the television. 
        As your ranting continues, your legs apparently become so weary that you 
        have to take a seat. But what now, Smug Pavid? Why so silent? Ah I see; 
        Temptation Island takes another victim. <br>
        &nbsp; But have no shame, Pavid. Let us just simply accept that we are 
        all Americans. We are not a nationality of real class. We will watch reality 
        TV. <br>
        &nbsp; However, while I appear to endorse reality TV, I must draw the 
        line somewhere. If Bowdoin decides to create their own version of Temptation 
        Island, bad things will happen in 5A. The Bowdoin Bubble is a terrible, 
        terrible phenomenon. In short, it made me want to set myself on fire.<br>
        &nbsp; The reason I mention this is at all, instead of filing it away 
        into the part of my brain reserved for "I don't ever want to think about 
        that again",, is that I have gotten wind of a Bowdoin Bubble Part II. 
        Part II? That's like, if given the chance, electing George "Dubya" again. 
        Just for fun. A neat little thing to do. <br>
        &nbsp; All joking aside, I beg this campus to stand up for what is good 
        and right and to stop the Bowdoin Bubble from rearing it is ugly head 
        yet again. Temptation Island is one thing…it is removed. Beautiful people 
        on an island far far away is a very different thing than fifteen people, 
        in the basement of a social house, who all make me uncomfortable when 
        I look at the television.<br>
        &nbsp; Now I know you'll say, "just don't watch it , Julianna," but I've 
        gone over this! I can't do anything about it! I will watch all 24 hours 
        of the Bowdoin Bubble if it airs again, even if I am sitting on my couch, 
        on fire. So, if only for my sake, please please keep this campus reality 
        TV-free. Thank you.</p>
