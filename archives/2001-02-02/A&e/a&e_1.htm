      <p> &nbsp; The fact that Tug Buse will be working next year as a deckhand 
        for a tugboat company in Puget Sound immediately marks him in my mind 
        as one of Bowdoin's most intriguing characters. But, as I discovered in 
        my preparation for this article, Bowdoin's preeminent Civil War aficianado 
        is also one of Bowdoin's most artistic individuals. This Friday and Saturday, 
        at 6:00 p.m. in Smith Auditorium in Sills Hall, Tug will present "Fox 
        Movietone News Unreleased Reel #644," his first venture in 16mm film.<br>
        &nbsp; Although it runs for only ten minutes, the film is the product 
        of extended amounts of time and money. The process of shooting in 16mm 
        is demanding, although Tug maintains that the clarity and warmth of the 
        final product more than redeems the amount of effort the medium requires. 
        Moreover, the restrictions imposed by film-it had to be less than ten 
        minutes, silent, and black and white due to budgeting concerns-actually 
        generated the idea for "Unreleased Reel."<br>
        &nbsp; Those who were on campus last year might recall Tug's feature length 
        video, "Picked Off." In Tug's current project, he returns to the subject 
        of World War II, again setting his piece in northern Europe. "Unreleased 
        Reel" mimics the flickering, silent black and white films of the period, 
        and it is meant to convey the amateur efforts of two downed American soldiers 
        who find a camera and record messages for their loved ones.<br>
        &nbsp; Tug filmed the piece on his family's land in Washington state, 
        where he notes that the coniferous forests approximates a Belgian landscape 
        more accurately than the deciduous and coniferous mix of southern Maine. 
        Filming near home also allowed Tug to cast his high school amis, and even 
        his young cousin Kyle. Fans of "Picked Off" might recognize Tom Lapham 
        and Daniel Schwager, who will likely star in Tug's next film, a rafting 
        adventure story Tug will begin work on this summer.<br>
        &nbsp; In addition to "Unreleased Reel," fans of Tug's work can also anticipate 
        the spring screening of his documentary on the period of Reconstruction. 
        Undertaken as the chief component of his honors project, this combination 
        of academic and artistic material is typical of Tug's desire to integrate 
        his historical interests with his aspirations to at least a part-time 
        career as an independent filmmaker. <br>
        &nbsp; While endeavoring to make a career in film might seem a bleak prospect 
        for some, Tug is both a realist and an optimist. He states earnestly that 
        "making the film is a success" and fully understands that his passion 
        is very unlikely to make him rich, and will more likely prove a monetary 
        liability.<br>
        &nbsp; And yet, despite such assurances that he will cope well with the 
        bohemian existence of the independent filmmaker, Tug's prospects look 
        bright. He has already lined up two "gigs," as he calls them, for next 
        summer. He will shoot promotional videos for Roche Harbor Resort on San 
        Juan Island in the Puget Sound and a Russian lumber company currently 
        doing work in Washington state. With this money, added to wages garnered 
        as a tugboat deckhand, Tug should have enough money not only to subsist, 
        but to support the artistic talents he so amply demonstrates in "Unreleased 
        Reel."</p>
