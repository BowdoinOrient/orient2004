      <p> &nbsp; You've walked by it a million times, have class within a hundred 
        feet of it, admired it from the quad, and had lunch on its steps; that's 
        right - the art museum, and William Kentridge's new exhibit entitled " 
        STEREOSCOPE " and " WEIGHING...and WANTING " is just one more reason to 
        pay this wonderful place a visit.<br>
        &nbsp; Kentridge, an internationally-renowned contemporary South African 
        artist, was born in Johannesburg in 1955 and was very much influenced 
        by the forces and issues surrounding apartheid. The son of a prominent 
        anti-apartheid lawyer, Kentridge was exposed at an early age to the horrors 
        of apartheid which are reflected indirectly in his intimate films based 
        around the two central characters of Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitelbaum. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Kentridge's biography is important in understanding his art; his 
        life is deeply intertwined with his work, producing films dealing with 
        unspecified and personal conflicts which allude to broader social conflicts. 
        Kentridge is neither an active participant nor a distant observer in these 
        struggles, providing us with the opportunity to both understand these 
        conflicts and feel them personally.<br>
        &nbsp; Madeleine Grynsztejn, Senior Curator of the San Francisco Museum 
        of Modern Art, spoke last Saturday in Kresge on Kentridge's technique, 
        characteristics, and influences. To create these films Kentridge makes 
        a few central drawings and alters them thousands of times, recording the 
        results of each erasure or addition on 16 mm film. Grynsztejn noted that 
        the camera itself remains fixed, meaning that to make a close up or pan 
        out Kentridge physically draws each slight alteration physically. This 
        intensive technique which Grynsztejn called " stalking the drawing " can 
        take up to a week to produce only 40 minutes of film. The result is a 
        film which gives the feeling of being inside a sort of living drawing.<br>
        &nbsp; The characters of Soho Eckstein and Felix Teitelbaum are central 
        to all of Kentridge's films. Eckstein, a symbol of industrial and capitalist 
        greed, and Teitelbaum, a helpless and sometimes indifferent witness, are 
        at times foils to one another and at other times merge into the same character. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Grynsztejn commented that he makes many references to internal 
        sight by including devices such as microscopes and MRI and x-ray machines, 
        pointing the viewer toward the inner truth of his struggles. The idea 
        of memory and remembrance is also important to Kentridge. This is visible 
        in the constant erasures and additions made to his drawings which remain 
        visible in each new frame and in his depictions of landscape in which 
        the "natural process of erosion also seeks to blot out memories. "<br>
        &nbsp; Grynsztejn stated that Kentridge has been influenced by artists 
        as diverse as Goya and the German Expressionists, and most heavily by 
        the art of the South African resistance movement of the 1970s and 80s. 
        Professor Daniel Lieberfeld of the Government Department spoke on Wednesday 
        on the sociological and political contexts of the resistance movement 
        which surrounded Kentridge.<br>
        &nbsp; Lieberfeld asked the question, "What kind of strange life does 
        one lead as a middle-class white South African?" He pointed to the fragility 
        of the South African reconciliation and to Kentridge's notion that to 
        feel the guilt of apartheid is only the first step to reformation.<br>
        &nbsp; On top of his flourishing career in the visual arts, Kentridge 
        also has a strong background in theater which becomes plain when you first 
        walk into the gallery. There is a collection of drawings from "WEIGHING...and 
        WANTING ", which, although incredibly perceptive and haunting in their 
        own right, at the same time give the impression of old film props that 
        you might find on an MGM set. Watching these films feels as if you've 
        somehow been allowed to read Kentridge's diary, and what he has to say 
        is so sincere that you can't help but feel something yourself.<br>
        &nbsp; This incredible exhibit is on display at the Museum of Art through 
        March 18th, Monday-Friday 10am-5pm, Sundays 2-5pm. Student-led tours are 
        available through the museum by calling 725-3743. Don't miss Professor 
        McGee of the Art History Department this Wednesday, Feb.7 at the museum 
        when she gives a talk entitled "William Kentridge and South African Art: 
        A Historical Perspective".</p>
