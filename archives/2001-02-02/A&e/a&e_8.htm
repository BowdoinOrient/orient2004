      <p>&nbsp; If you're like me, then even though there have only been two weeks 
        of classes, you are already starting to feel the burden of work. You probably 
        have lots of aggression and stress building up, but what can a poor boy 
        do except to sing for a rock and roll band? Because in sleepy Brunswick 
        town, there's just no place for a street fighting man. But don't worry, 
        the Film Society has got you covered with a weekend of fight movies. We've 
        got new movies and older titles, classics and camp. As always, they will 
        be shown in Smith Auditorium, Sills Hall, and are completely free and 
        open to the public.</p>
      <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocky</i> - Friday at 7pm <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drop</i> <i>Dead</i> <i>Gorgeous</i> - Friday at 
        9pm <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raging</i> <i>Bull</i> - Saturday at 7pm <br>
        <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godzilla</i> vs. Mothra - Saturday at 9pm </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp; Friday at 7pm - <i>Rocky</i> (1976) <br>
        &nbsp; Directed by: John G. Avildsen <br>
        &nbsp; Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith, Burt 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Young, Carl Weathers <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; If you needed to find one film that is the embodiment of the American 
        Dream, odds are that Rocky would do the trick. It's the story of a poor 
        Philadelphia boy who becomes a boxing legend. Along the way, he falls 
        for pet shop girl Adrian and gets trained by the Penguin himself, Burgess 
        Meredith. Don't be fooled by all the lousy sequels, this movie is truly 
        great (it did win the best picture Oscar). The Gonna Fly Now training 
        sequence is especially moving. So go punch some frozen meat, drink some 
        raw eggs, and make your way over for a moving American classic. <b>Rated 
        PG</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp; Friday at 9pm - <i>Drop</i> <i>Dead</i> <i>Gorgeous</i> (1999) 
        <br>
        &nbsp; Directed by: Michael Patrick Jann <br>
        &nbsp; Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Ellen Barkin, Denise Richards, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Kirstie Alley, Mindy Sterling, Nora Dunn and Adam West<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; Fight movies aren't always testosterone filled, as this film proves. 
        One of the finest mockumentaries that doesn't involve Christopher Guest, 
        the story involves a crew covering a Minnesota beauty pageant. A former 
        winner will stop at nothing to get her daughter crowed the winner. This 
        means making sure underdog Amber doesn't steal the spotlight. There are 
        lots of great "behind-the-scenes" catfights and bickering between contestants. 
        In reality though, this film is all about privileged vs. white trash, 
        rich vs. poor, good vs. evil. And best of all, it's hilarious.<b> Rated 
        PG-13 </b></p>
      <p>&nbsp; Saturday at 7pm - Raging Bull (1980) <br>
        &nbsp; Directed by: Martin Scorsese <br>
        &nbsp; Starring: Robert DeNiro, Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci, Frank Vincent<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; This movie is the tale of real-life boxer Jake La Motta. He has 
        problems with controlling his anger, and the rage that makes him unstoppable 
        in the ring spills over into his home life. This movie was filmed almost 
        exclusively in black and white so Scorsese could ensure against fading 
        of the print, a problem that he feels very strongly about. Beyond this, 
        there is so much care put into this film by Scorsese. The way everything 
        is presented and planned out is amazing. There are incredible things done 
        with film speed, sound effects, camera tricks, and the way the characters 
        are presented. It is a remarkable film that shouldn't be missed. <b>Rated 
        R</b> </p>
      <p> &nbsp; Saturday at 9pm - Godzilla vs. Mothra (1992) <br>
        &nbsp; Directed by: Takao Okawara <br>
        &nbsp; Starring: Godzilla, Mothra, Battra <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; OK, so it's not the 1964 classic version, but no grudge match like 
        this one could be contained in a single movie. A group of research scientists 
        travel to famed Infant Island and come across The Cosmos (you know, the 
        girls in the shells). They say that Mother Earth is mad at the way the 
        humans have mistreated her, so she has released Battra to destroy them. 
        The Cosmos offer assistance in the way of Mothra, who will battle Battra. 
        Simple enough, right? Well Godzilla must have thought that with all the 
        other monsters around, he would get another chance at leveling Tokyo, 
        because he comes out of nowhere to join in the mayhem. OK, this movie 
        is really silly, but so what? You know you want to see it.<b> Not Rated
