In the 2004 version of the Orient site, the frontend and backend were completely separate codebases. This directory lived locally on the computers in the Orient and was run off a WAMP server. There's no security; the security was that it (and its hardcoded passwords) only existed on the computers in the Orient house. Yes, it was completely insane.
