		<tr>
		<td width=50%>
		<p><b>Registration:</b> U.S. citizens who will be 18 years of age or older on or before election day may register to vote up to and including Election Day. If you are registered in Maine but have since changed your address, you will need to update your registration. Be prepared to prove your Maine residency, e.g. with a Bowdoin Directory or utility bill. Note that registering in Maine may affect state scholarship eligibility.
		<p><b>Hours:</b> Polls open at 8 a.m. and close at 8 p.m. Under Maine law, you must be allowed to vote if you are in line by 8 p.m.
		</td>
		<td width=50%>
		<p><b>Districts:</b> Bowdoin students living on campus are split between Districts 63 and 66 for the state election and between Districts 2, 5, 6, and 7 for the town election. You may choose not to vote for a question or office by leaving those circles blank. If you make a mistake, do not erase; you may request a new ballot.
		<p><b>Challenged ballots:</b> Legally, you may not be turned away! If your residency or identification is in question, you must be allowed to cast a challenged ballot.
