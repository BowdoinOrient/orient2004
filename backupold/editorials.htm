            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#808080">EDITORIAL 
            PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 4, 2005</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maine 
            citizens—including hundreds of voters from this campus—will go to 
            the polls Tuesday to vote on Question 1, a proposal that would 
            repeal Maine’s law protecting individuals against discrimination on 
            the basis of their sexual orientation.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maine’s decision 
            on November 8 will send a message to individuals throughout the 
            state. We hope that Maine will choose to say that it is okay to 
            thrive as who you are.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A vote in favor 
            of this referendum would go against the American ideal of equality. 
            Our society is strongest when we approach our ideals. At Bowdoin, 
            and public and private institutions throughout Maine, we have 
            already seen how a community edges closer this ideal when it chooses 
            to expand its definition of equality—and not limit it.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It may be easy to 
            forget the difficulty some of our fellow students face, and fall 
            into the trap of believing the scare tactics used by the proponents 
            of Question 1.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many such 
            arguments surrounding Question 1 have been thoroughly discussed in 
            these pages in recent weeks. However, it is important to stay 
            focused on the referendum question itself. The choice we will make 
            on Tuesday is not about maximizing profits; in fact, corporations 
            from coast to coast have made the choice to adopt these policies. It 
            is certainly not about gay marriage. A “Yes” vote for Question 1 is 
            about revoking a law that provides equal protection for Maine’s 
            citizens. It would be a step backward from the way life in Maine 
            should be.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Society is best 
            off when it strives for equality of opportunity. Opposing Question 1 
            tells Maine’s citizens that while we cannot guarantee that you will 
            succeed, we can guarantee that your sexual orientation will not be 
            used to deny you that opportunity. We urge a “No” vote on Question 
            1.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="4">‘Yes’ on 7 for 
            fishing families</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="1" color="#808080">EDITORIAL 
            PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 4, 2005</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Question 1 has 
            overshadowed another proposal on Tuesday’s ballot that is also 
            important for the people of Maine. If approved, Question 7 would 
            help protect one of the most important elements of Maine’s economy: 
            our working waterfront.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Currently, 
            waterfront property on Maine’s coastlines is assessed using formulas 
            for the land’s “best” possible use. Question 7 would let the 
            Legislature use current use formulas to determine the value of 
            waterfront property used for commercial fishing operations. In 
            recent years, waterfront property values have skyrocketed, with 
            out-of-state citizens willing to pay exorbitant sums for pieces of 
            Maine’s coastline. As a result, fishermen are gradually being pushed 
            away from Maine’s shores. Less than 1 percent of Maine coastline is 
            currently considered part of the working waterfront.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This proposal’s 
            protections are already in place for farmland and forestland. The 
            amendment would not interfere with market-based competition, since 
            it would not interfere with the retail prices of properties. 
            Fishermen could still sell their property as they wish.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Question 1, 
            this amendment is about people—people from familiar places like 
            Bailey Island and Harpswell. If passed, the proposal will make life 
            just a little easier for the hard-working men, women, and families 
            who offer so much to our state’s economy and character. Since this 
            bill is good for Maine’s working waterfront and good for Maine’s 
            economy, we urge a “Yes” vote on Question 7.</font></p>
